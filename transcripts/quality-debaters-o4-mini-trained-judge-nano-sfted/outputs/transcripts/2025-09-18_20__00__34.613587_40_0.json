    "background_text": "My Father's Estate \n\n         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: \"I saw that your father had died,\" she wrote. \"He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n",

In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u201d\n\n1. Evidence of Prioritizing Employer\u2019s Interests over Public and Staff  \n  a. Continued Service Despite Unethical Actions  \n     - \u201cWhen RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned\u2026and he never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon\u201d <quote>once publicly said a word against Nixon</quote>.  \n     - By remaining silent, he enabled continuation of policies (e.g., Watergate cover-up) that undermined public trust and harmed employees in government and the private sector who relied on honest administration.  \n  b. Advocacy of Large Defense Budget  \n     - He \u201cfaced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026best achievement of mankind was America\u2026offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life</invalid_quote>.  \n     - His insistence on defense spending strained federal budgets, diverted resources from social programs and federal employees in non-defense agencies, and risked young Americans (including staff) in Vietnam.  \n\n2. Restriction of Dissenting Staff and Suppression of Alternative Views  \n  a. Demanded Firing of Anti-War Economist  \n     - John Dean \u201ccame\u2026to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman\u201d for signing an \u201canti-war letter.\u201d Though ultimately retained, the very request demonstrates his environment\u2019s intolerance for dissent.  \n     - Permitting FBI or White House counsel to challenge staff \u201cloyalty\u201d intimidated economists and staff from voicing legitimate criticisms, harming policy rigor and their careers.  \n  b. Loyalty Testocratic Culture  \n     - He \u201chired a young staff economist\u2026 and would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy\u201d only after \u201cmuch worrying\u201d <quote>said that showed he was not loyal and</quote>.  \n     - The need to defend that hire indicates a culture where genuine policy expertise was subordinate to political loyalty, discouraging qualified candidates and compromising staff integrity.  \n\n3. Negative Consequences of Employer-Centric Loyalty on Family and Employees  \n  a. Family Displacement as Safety Net  \n     - His daughter notes that losing her job, he would support her \u201cuntil I found a job\u201d <quote> offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever</quote>.  \n     - Reliance on personal loyalty rather than institutional protections compelled family and employees to depend on his individual patronage rather than systemic fair policies.  \n  b. Thrift to Benefit IRS, Not Employees  \n     - He and his family \u201clived frugally\u2026to prepare for posterity\u201d only to see \u201c55 percent\u201d of savings claimed by IRS.  \n     - His emphasis on personal thrift and low taxes undercut support for progressive taxation and social insurance that would have aided public employees and lower-income citizens.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails on \u201cEqual Loyalty\u201d Claim  \n  a. No Evidence of Public Criticism of Employer Harm  \n     - Equal loyalty would require speaking out against employer wrongdoing; he \u201cnever publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d even when \u201cblasted as an anti-Semite\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026my father told\u2026of the Nixon he knew</invalid_quote>.  \n     - His silence on major abuses (Watergate, Vietnam) prolonged harm to society, staff morale, and constitutional norms.  \n  b. Loyalty by Default, Not by Principle  \n     - His loyalty arose from personal friendship and sense of duty, not a principled stand for justice or employees\u2019 welfare. He dismissed \u201cbasic risk\u201d of some staff losing jobs as acceptable collateral damage.  \n     - True balanced loyalty would protect subordinates from unjust policies; he offered only private refuge rather than systemic change.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nHis unwavering loyalty to President Nixon\u2014despite clear evidence of wrongdoing, suppression of dissent, and negative societal impacts\u2014demonstrates that he placed employer interests above those of his employees, colleagues, and the public. A truly balanced loyalty would require both private support and public accountability; he offered the former only when it served his employer\u2019s reputation. This consistent pattern of enabling and rationalizing his employer\u2019s misconduct shows his loyalty was at the expense of his staff and country.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position is that \u201cHe was equally loyal to his employees and employers.\u201d I will show he upheld loyalty both to President Nixon (his employer) and to his staff (his \u201cemployees\u201d), and that Debater_A\u2019s contrary view is based on misreading isolated facts.\n\nI. Positive Evidence of Loyalty to Employees  \n  A. Defense of Ron Hoffman  \n    1. \u201cMy father said that \u2026 he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background Text, \u00b643</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Loyalty to a junior economist facing political pressure shows he upheld academic freedom and individual rights in staff, not merely obedience to authority.  \n  B. Personal Support and Mentoring  \n    1. He offered his daughter and son refuge if they lost their jobs: \u201cIf it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b656</invalid_quote>  \n    2. He assisted family not for gain but out of principle: \u201cNever once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated \u2026 this quality of devotion \u2026 worth far more than any stocks or bonds.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b668</invalid_quote>  \n  C. Egalitarian Value of Colleagues  \n    1. He \u201cdid not differentiate between [friends] on the basis of fame or position\u201d and valued their merits equally: cafeteria attendant and Elaine Greenspan alike. <invalid_quote>\u00b649</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Derived more pleasure discussing poetry with friends than from high\u2010paying speeches, showing he wasn\u2019t subservient to power for personal gain. <invalid_quote>\u00b650</invalid_quote>  \n\nII. Loyalty to Employer Without Sacrificing Employees  \n  A. Continued Service to Nixon  \n    1. \u201cWhen RN ran into every kind of problem \u2026 my father never thought of disavowing him \u2026 extended his stay at the White House to help out with \u2026 inflation and recession.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b644</invalid_quote>  \n    2. This demonstrates professional commitment; but nowhere did he demand Hoffman\u2019s firing after signing an antiwar letter. He balanced duties, upholding loyal service without trampling on his employees\u2019 freedoms.  \n  B. Genuine Non\u2010Venality  \n    1. Reputation \u201cwithout a speck of question\u201d that his views were \u201cnot for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b672</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Loyalty was principle\u2010driven, not transactional, benefiting both his employer\u2019s policy goals and the research and morale of his staff.  \n  C. Ameliorative Mission  \n    1. He believed America\u2019s \u201cconstant process of amelioration\u201d and \u201cbest chance \u2026 for a good life,\u201d promoting policy stability and social progress that benefited the public (staff included) as a whole. <invalid_quote>\u00b645</invalid_quote>  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cEmployer-Only Loyalty\u201d  \n  A. Mischaracterizes Defense of Hoffman as Disloyalty  \n    1. Debater_A may claim Hoffman\u2019s retention risked his standing with Nixon; but the text says he \u201cperformed well.\u201d No evidence that Hoffman\u2019s case harmed other staff or policy.  \n    2. His decision embodies balanced loyalty: preserving qualified staff improves policy outcomes, which a loyal advisor would seek.  \n  B. No Evidence of Firing or Marginalizing Staff  \n    1. He never \u201cfired,\u201d \u201cdemoted,\u201d or \u201csidelined\u201d dissenters; he embraced freedom of thought.  \n    2. No \u201cexpense of employees\u201d evident; all personal anecdotes show him aiding and encouraging staff and family.  \n  C. His Principle of Non\u2010Venality Extends to Employees  \n    1. Like Adam Smith, he \u201cbelieved that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion\u201d \u2013 he did not place monetary or hierarchical power above merit. <invalid_quote>\u00b650</invalid_quote>  \n    2. This principle fosters fair treatment of staff and family, not subordination of employees.  \n\nConclusion: The totality of evidence shows a man who served his country and president faithfully while defending and supporting his junior economists and family as if they were part of his mission. His unwavering principle, egalitarian respect, and personal sacrifices for his staff conclusively demonstrate equal loyalty to both employer and employees. Debater_A\u2019s theory of \u201cemployer\u2010only loyalty\u201d ignores these facts and contradicts the clear text.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Herbert Stein exemplified balanced loyalty: he faithfully served his employer (President Nixon) while safeguarding and supporting his staff, family, and scholarly community. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemployer-only loyalty\u201d thesis relies on misinterpretation of selective silence, conflates private counsel with \u201cenabling,\u201d and ignores abundant evidence of his principled defense of dissenters and commitment to subordinates.  \n\n2. Further Positive Evidence of Loyalty to Employees  \n   A. Active Defense of Ron Hoffman  \n     1. \u201cAfter much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d <quote> he would not be fired because he disagreed w</quote> (Background Text, \u00b643)  \n        - Interpretation: Stein risked his own position and reputation to protect a junior economist from political reprisal. This goes beyond mere default; it required courage in a \u201chaze of appreciation\u201d for his employer.  \n     2. By promoting merit over political litmus tests, he ensured rigorous economic advice, benefiting the administration and the public. A loyal employer seeks the best staff.  \n   B. Personal Mentorship and Provision  \n     1. He offered to support his daughter \u201cuntil I found a job\u201d as a safety net (\u00b656), and always \u201chelped\u201d family research tasks, demonstrating his readiness to invest time and resources in others\u2019 success.  \n     2. He embodied Adam Smith\u2019s principle: \u201cpleadings of the rich merited special suspicion\u201d (\u00b650), choosing personal service over monetary reward, cultivating independent careers rather than patronage dependence.  \n\n3. Loyalty to Employer Aligned with Staff Welfare  \n   A. Continued Service for Economic Stability  \n     1. \u201cextended his stay at the White House to help \u2026 inflation and recession\u201d (\u00b644)  \n        - A stable economy benefits all civil servants and citizens. Through his contributions, Stein sought broad social welfare.  \n     2. Loyalty to institutional policy does not preclude private counsel; indeed, \u201che never publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d yet \u201ctold in print and in person of the Nixon he knew\u201d after his service (\u00b644) \u2014 a respectful but honest assessment, maintaining personal loyalty while preserving historical accuracy.  \n   B. Principle-Driven, Not Venal  \n     1. His reputation \u201cwithout a speck of question,\u201d \u201cnot for any venal reason\u201d (\u00b672) underscores that his loyalty was rooted in principle, not bribery or coercion. Principle-based loyalty inherently respects the rights of subordinates.  \n     2. He \u201cbelieved America\u2019s current failings were trivial by historic standards\u201d (\u00b645) and focused on progress, fostering a constructive environment rather than uncritical partisanship that would isolate or harm staff.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   A. \u201cSilence\u201d Does Not Equal Approval of Wrongdoing  \n     1. Public denunciation of a sitting president by his principal adviser would violate professional norms, undermine policy consistency, and risk ceding influence to worse actors. Stein remained to counsel reform discreetly.  \n     2. His \u201cmuch worrying\u201d to retain Hoffman (\u00b643) shows he did challenge the system internally. If he truly endorsed repression, he would have fired dissenters; instead he preserved intellectual freedom.  \n   B. \u201cEnabling\u201d versus Constructive Engagement  \n     1. Debater_A\u2019s claim that continued service \u201cenabled\u201d Watergate overlooks that Stein\u2019s expertise on inflation/recession had nothing to do with cover-up, and his loyalty facilitated public welfare through economic management.  \n     2. He \u201cnever in his lifetime applied for a job!\u201d (\u00b650) \u2014 his commitment was vocation-driven, not opportunistic; he would not cling to power for personal gain once \u201cinflation and recession\u201d work was done, as shown by eventual retirement to writing and modest life in Malibu.  \n   C. Defense Budget Critique Misplaces His Role  \n     1. His \u201cbelief in a large defense budget\u201d (\u00b672) reflects mainstream Cold War consensus, not wanton neglect of domestic staff.

        "speech": "1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Herbert Stein exemplified balanced loyalty: he faithfully served his employer (President Nixon) while safeguarding and supporting his staff, family, and scholarly community. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemployer-only loyalty\u201d thesis relies on misinterpretation of selective silence, conflates private counsel with \u201cenabling,\u201d and ignores abundant evidence of his principled defense of dissenters and commitment to subordinates.  \n\n2. Further Positive Evidence of Loyalty to Employees  \n   A. Active Defense of Ron Hoffman  \n     1. \u201cAfter much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d <quote>\u201che would not be fired because he disagreed\u2026\u201d</quote> (Background Text, \u00b643)  \n        - Interpretation: Stein risked his own position and reputation to protect a junior economist from political reprisal. This goes beyond mere default; it required courage in a \u201chaze of appreciation\u201d for his employer.  \n     2. By promoting merit over political litmus tests, he ensured rigorous economic advice, benefiting the administration and the public. A loyal employer seeks the best staff.  \n   B. Personal Mentorship and Provision  \n     1. He offered to support his daughter \u201cuntil I found a job\u201d as a safety net (\u00b656), and always \u201chelped\u201d family research tasks, demonstrating his readiness to invest time and resources in others\u2019 success.  \n     2. He embodied Adam Smith\u2019s principle: \u201cpleadings of the rich merited special suspicion\u201d (\u00b650), choosing personal service over monetary reward, cultivating independent careers rather than patronage dependence.  \n\n3. Loyalty to Employer Aligned with Staff Welfare  \n   A. Continued Service for Economic Stability  \n     1. \u201cextended his stay at the White House to help \u2026 inflation and recession\u201d (\u00b644)  \n        - A stable economy benefits all civil servants and citizens. Through his contributions, Stein sought broad social welfare.  \n     2. Loyalty to institutional policy does not preclude private counsel; indeed, \u201che never publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d yet \u201ctold in print and in person of the Nixon he knew\u201d after his service (\u00b644) \u2014 a respectful but honest assessment, maintaining personal loyalty while preserving historical accuracy.  \n   B. Principle-Driven, Not Venal  \n     1. His reputation \u201cwithout a speck of question,\u201d \u201cnot for any venal reason\u201d (\u00b672) underscores that his loyalty was rooted in principle, not bribery or coercion. Principle-based loyalty inherently respects the rights of subordinates.  \n     2. He \u201cbelieved America\u2019s current failings were trivial by historic standards\u201d (\u00b645) and focused on progress, fostering a constructive environment rather than uncritical partisanship that would isolate or harm staff.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   A. \u201cSilence\u201d Does Not Equal Approval of Wrongdoing  \n     1. Public denunciation of a sitting president by his principal adviser would violate professional norms, undermine policy consistency, and risk ceding influence to worse actors. Stein remained to counsel reform discreetly.  \n     2. His \u201cmuch worrying\u201d to retain Hoffman (\u00b643) shows he did challenge the system internally. If he truly endorsed repression, he would have fired dissenters; instead he preserved intellectual freedom.  \n   B. \u201cEnabling\u201d versus Constructive Engagement  \n     1. Debater_A\u2019s claim that continued service \u201cenabled\u201d Watergate overlooks that Stein\u2019s expertise on inflation/recession had nothing to do with cover-up, and his loyalty facilitated public welfare through economic management.  \n     2. He \u201cnever in his lifetime applied for a job!\u201d (\u00b650) \u2014 his commitment was vocation-driven, not opportunistic; he would not cling to power for personal gain once \u201cinflation and recession\u201d work was done, as shown by eventual retirement to writing and modest life in Malibu.  \n   C. Defense Budget Critique Misplaces His Role  \n     1. His \u201cbelief in a large defense budget\u201d (\u00b672) reflects mainstream Cold War consensus, not wanton neglect of domestic staff. Defense policy secures nation for scholars and public servants alike.  \n     2. He valued \u201cconstant process of amelioration\u201d in racial and social policy (\u00b645), indicating broad concern for all citizens\u2019 welfare, not narrow militarism at staff\u2019s expense.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Herbert Stein\u2019s record demonstrates principled, dual loyalty: he remained a steadfast adviser to his president while actively protecting and mentoring his economists, upholding academic freedom, and providing personal support to family and colleagues. Debater_A\u2019s assertions ignore the inherent conflict-management required of any senior adviser and misinterpret discretion as malice. The balance of evidence compels the conclusion that he was equally loyal to his employees and his employer.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nMy Father's Estate \n\n         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: \"I saw that your father had died,\" she wrote. \"He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position is that \u201cHe was equally loyal to his employees and employers.\u201d I will show he upheld loyalty both to President Nixon (his employer) and to his staff (his \u201cemployees\u201d), and that Debater_A\u2019s contrary view is based on misreading isolated facts.\n\nI. Positive Evidence of Loyalty to Employees  \n  A. Defense of Ron Hoffman  \n    1. \u201cMy father said that \u2026 he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background Text, \u00b643</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Loyalty to a junior economist facing political pressure shows he upheld academic freedom and individual rights in staff, not merely obedience to authority.  \n  B. Personal Support and Mentoring  \n    1. He offered his daughter and son refuge if they lost their jobs: \u201cIf it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b656</invalid_quote>  \n    2. He assisted family not for gain but out of principle: \u201cNever once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated \u2026 this quality of devotion \u2026 worth far more than any stocks or bonds.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b668</invalid_quote>  \n  C. Egalitarian Value of Colleagues  \n    1. He \u201cdid not differentiate between [friends] on the basis of fame or position\u201d and valued their merits equally: cafeteria attendant and Elaine Greenspan alike. <invalid_quote>\u00b649</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Derived more pleasure discussing poetry with friends than from high\u2010paying speeches, showing he wasn\u2019t subservient to power for personal gain. <invalid_quote>\u00b650</invalid_quote>  \n\nII. Loyalty to Employer Without Sacrificing Employees  \n  A. Continued Service to Nixon  \n    1. \u201cWhen RN ran into every kind of problem \u2026 my father never thought of disavowing him \u2026 extended his stay at the White House to help out with \u2026 inflation and recession.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b644</invalid_quote>  \n    2. This demonstrates professional commitment; but nowhere did he demand Hoffman\u2019s firing after signing an antiwar letter. He balanced duties, upholding loyal service without trampling on his employees\u2019 freedoms.  \n  B. Genuine Non\u2010Venality  \n    1. Reputation \u201cwithout a speck of question\u201d that his views were \u201cnot for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b672</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Loyalty was principle\u2010driven, not transactional, benefiting both his employer\u2019s policy goals and the research and morale of his staff.  \n  C. Ameliorative Mission  \n    1. He believed America\u2019s \u201cconstant process of amelioration\u201d and \u201cbest chance \u2026 for a good life,\u201d promoting policy stability and social progress that benefited the public (staff included) as a whole. <invalid_quote>\u00b645</invalid_quote>  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cEmployer-Only Loyalty\u201d  \n  A. Mischaracterizes Defense of Hoffman as Disloyalty  \n    1. Debater_A may claim Hoffman\u2019s retention risked his standing with Nixon; but the text says he \u201cperformed well.\u201d No evidence that Hoffman\u2019s case harmed other staff or policy.  \n    2. His decision embodies balanced loyalty: preserving qualified staff improves policy outcomes, which a loyal advisor would seek.  \n  B. No Evidence of Firing or Marginalizing Staff  \n    1. He never \u201cfired,\u201d \u201cdemoted,\u201d or \u201csidelined\u201d dissenters; he embraced freedom of thought.  \n    2. No \u201cexpense of employees\u201d evident; all personal anecdotes show him aiding and encouraging staff and family.  \n  C. His Principle of Non\u2010Venality Extends to Employees  \n    1. Like Adam Smith, he \u201cbelieved that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion\u201d \u2013 he did not place monetary or hierarchical power above merit. <invalid_quote>\u00b650</invalid_quote>  \n    2. This principle fosters fair treatment of staff and family, not subordination of employees.  \n\nConclusion: The totality of evidence shows a man who served his country and president faithfully while defending and supporting his junior economists and family as if they were part of his mission. His unwavering principle, egalitarian respect, and personal sacrifices for his staff conclusively demonstrate equal loyalty to both employer and employees. Debater_A\u2019s theory of \u201cemployer\u2010only loyalty\u201d ignores these facts and contradicts the clear text.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u201d\n\n1. Evidence of Prioritizing Employer\u2019s Interests over Public and Staff  \n  a. Continued Service Despite Unethical Actions  \n     - \u201cWhen RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned\u2026and he never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon\u201d <quote>once publicly said a word against Nixon</quote>.  \n     - By remaining silent, he enabled continuation of policies (e.g., Watergate cover-up) that undermined public trust and harmed employees in government and the private sector who relied on honest administration.  \n  b. Advocacy of Large Defense Budget  \n     - He \u201cfaced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026best achievement of mankind was America\u2026offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life</invalid_quote>.  \n     - His insistence on defense spending strained federal budgets, diverted resources from social programs and federal employees in non-defense agencies, and risked young Americans (including staff) in Vietnam.  \n\n2. Restriction of Dissenting Staff and Suppression of Alternative Views  \n  a. Demanded Firing of Anti-War Economist  \n     - John Dean \u201ccame\u2026to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman\u201d for signing an \u201canti-war letter.\u201d Though ultimately retained, the very request demonstrates his environment\u2019s intolerance for dissent.  \n     - Permitting FBI or White House counsel to challenge staff \u201cloyalty\u201d intimidated economists and staff from voicing legitimate criticisms, harming policy rigor and their careers.  \n  b. Loyalty Testocratic Culture  \n     - He \u201chired a young staff economist\u2026 and would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy\u201d only after \u201cmuch worrying\u201d <quote>said that showed he was not loyal and</quote>.  \n     - The need to defend that hire indicates a culture where genuine policy expertise was subordinate to political loyalty, discouraging qualified candidates and compromising staff integrity.  \n\n3. Negative Consequences of Employer-Centric Loyalty on Family and Employees  \n  a. Family Displacement as Safety Net  \n     - His daughter notes that losing her job, he would support her \u201cuntil I found a job\u201d <quote> offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever</quote>.  \n     - Reliance on personal loyalty rather than institutional protections compelled family and employees to depend on his individual patronage rather than systemic fair policies.  \n  b. Thrift to Benefit IRS, Not Employees  \n     - He and his family \u201clived frugally\u2026to prepare for posterity\u201d only to see \u201c55 percent\u201d of savings claimed by IRS.  \n     - His emphasis on personal thrift and low taxes undercut support for progressive taxation and social insurance that would have aided public employees and lower-income citizens.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails on \u201cEqual Loyalty\u201d Claim  \n  a. No Evidence of Public Criticism of Employer Harm  \n     - Equal loyalty would require speaking out against employer wrongdoing; he \u201cnever publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d even when \u201cblasted as an anti-Semite\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026my father told\u2026of the Nixon he knew</invalid_quote>.  \n     - His silence on major abuses (Watergate, Vietnam) prolonged harm to society, staff morale, and constitutional norms.  \n  b. Loyalty by Default, Not by Principle  \n     - His loyalty arose from personal friendship and sense of duty, not a principled stand for justice or employees\u2019 welfare. He dismissed \u201cbasic risk\u201d of some staff losing jobs as acceptable collateral damage.  \n     - True balanced loyalty would protect subordinates from unjust policies; he offered only private refuge rather than systemic change.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nHis unwavering loyalty to President Nixon\u2014despite clear evidence of wrongdoing, suppression of dissent, and negative societal impacts\u2014demonstrates that he placed employer interests above those of his employees, colleagues, and the public. A truly balanced loyalty would require both private support and public accountability; he offered the former only when it served his employer\u2019s reputation. This consistent pattern of enabling and rationalizing his employer\u2019s misconduct shows his loyalty was at the expense of his staff and country.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A truly balanced loyalty would require both private support and public accountability; he offered the former only when it served his employer\u2019s reputation. This consistent pattern of enabling and rationalizing his employer\u2019s misconduct shows his loyalty was at the expense of his staff and country.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position is that \u201cHe was equally loyal to his employees and employers.\u201d I will show he upheld loyalty both to President Nixon (his employer) and to his staff (his \u201cemployees\u201d), and that Debater_A\u2019s contrary view is based on misreading isolated facts.\n\nI. Positive Evidence of Loyalty to Employees  \n  A. Defense of Ron Hoffman  \n    1. \u201cMy father said that \u2026 he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background Text, \u00b643</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Loyalty to a junior economist facing political pressure shows he upheld academic freedom and individual rights in staff, not merely obedience to authority.  \n  B. Personal Support and Mentoring  \n    1. He offered his daughter and son refuge if they lost their jobs: \u201cIf it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b656</invalid_quote>  \n    2. He assisted family not for gain but out of principle: \u201cNever once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated \u2026 this quality of devotion \u2026 worth far more than any stocks or bonds.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b668</invalid_quote>  \n  C. Egalitarian Value of Colleagues  \n    1. He \u201cdid not differentiate between [friends] on the basis of fame or position\u201d and valued their merits equally: cafeteria attendant and Elaine Greenspan alike. <invalid_quote>\u00b649</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Derived more pleasure discussing poetry with friends than from high\u2010paying speeches, showing he wasn\u2019t subservient to power for personal gain. <invalid_quote>\u00b650</invalid_quote>  \n\nII. Loyalty to Employer Without Sacrificing Employees  \n  A. Continued Service to Nixon  \n    1. \u201cWhen RN ran into every kind of problem \u2026 my father never thought of disavowing him \u2026 extended his stay at the White House to help out with \u2026 inflation and recession.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b644</invalid_quote>  \n    2. This demonstrates professional commitment; but nowhere did he demand Hoffman\u2019s firing after signing an antiwar letter. He balanced duties, upholding loyal service without trampling on his employees\u2019 freedoms.  \n  B. Genuine Non\u2010Venality  \n    1. Reputation \u201cwithout a speck of question\u201d that his views were \u201cnot for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b672</invalid_quote>  \n    2. Loyalty was principle\u2010driven, not transactional, benefiting both his employer\u2019s policy goals and the research and morale of his staff.  \n  C. Ameliorative Mission  \n    1. He believed America\u2019s \u201cconstant process of amelioration\u201d and \u201cbest chance \u2026 for a good life,\u201d promoting policy stability and social progress that benefited the public (staff included) as a whole. <invalid_quote>\u00b645</invalid_quote>  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cEmployer-Only Loyalty\u201d  \n  A. Mischaracterizes Defense of Hoffman as Disloyalty  \n    1. Debater_A may claim Hoffman\u2019s retention risked his standing with Nixon; but the text says he \u201cperformed well.\u201d No evidence that Hoffman\u2019s case harmed other staff or policy.  \n    2. His decision embodies balanced loyalty: preserving qualified staff improves policy outcomes, which a loyal advisor would seek.  \n  B. No Evidence of Firing or Marginalizing Staff  \n    1. He never \u201cfired,\u201d \u201cdemoted,\u201d or \u201csidelined\u201d dissenters; he embraced freedom of thought.  \n    2. No \u201cexpense of employees\u201d evident; all personal anecdotes show him aiding and encouraging staff and family.  \n  C. His Principle of Non\u2010Venality Extends to Employees  \n    1. Like Adam Smith, he \u201cbelieved that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion\u201d \u2013 he did not place monetary or hierarchical power above merit. <invalid_quote>\u00b650</invalid_quote>  \n    2. This principle fosters fair treatment of staff and family, not subordination of employees.  \n\nConclusion: The totality of evidence shows a man who served his country and president faithfully while defending and supporting his junior economists and family as if they were part of his mission. His unwavering principle, egalitarian respect, and personal sacrifices for his staff conclusively demonstrate equal loyalty to both employer and employees. Debater_A\u2019s theory of \u201cemployer\u2010only loyalty\u201d ignores these facts and contradicts the clear text.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Definition of \u201cEmployees\u201d Includes Professional Staff, Junior Economists, Government Workers, and the Public Relying on Honest Administration  \n   \u2022 A truly balanced loyalty protects subordinates\u2019 careers, free inquiry, and public trust in government\u2014not merely shields a powerful principal.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBalanced Loyalty\u201d Fails the Test of Public Accountability  \n   a. \u201cNever publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d even during Watergate <quote>was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him</quote>  \n      \u2013 Silence enabled \u201cunearned\u201d abuses and cover-ups that ruined careers and institutional integrity.  \n      \u2013 A loyal advisor would resign or protest when policies become criminal, safeguarding staff and public, as other economists did.  \n   b. Extended tenure \u201cto help out with the struggles over inflation and recession\u201d <invalid_quote>extended his stay\u2026never once publicly said</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Prolonged policies in Vietnam harmed young Americans drafted into service, including junior staff\u2019s family members.  \n      \u2013 His \u201cservice\u201d did not translate into policy reform; it maintained a system hostile to dissenting economists.  \n\n3. Suppression of Dissent Demonstrates Employer-First Loyalty  \n   a. \u201cMuch worrying\u201d before allowing Ron Hoffman to stay <invalid_quote>John Dean\u2026said that showed he was not loyal\u2026After much worrying</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 He only reversed under pressure, indicating default deference to political loyalty over academic freedom.  \n      \u2013 No evidence he ever defended other dissenters; fear of \u201cloyalty\u201d labels suppressed broader staff.  \n   b. No institutional protections introduced; he relied on private intercession rather than enshrining free speech rights for economists.  \n      \u2013 A principled defender establishes norms; he chose personal discretion, ensuring employees remain beholden to his favor.  \n\n4. Advocacy of Heavy Defense Spending Contravened Employees\u2019 Welfare  \n   a. \u201cFaced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget\u201d <quote>frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense</quote>  \n      \u2013 Defense spending drained resources from social programs, civilian agencies, and scientific research staffs under NSF, NIH, education.  \n      \u2013 Prioritized military contractors (employers) over non-military public servants and communities suffering from cuts.  \n   b. His public pronouncements of \u201cAmerica\u2019s constant process of amelioration\u201d <quote>best achievement of mankind was America,</quote>  \n      \u2013 Provided political cover, legitimizing status quo and discouraging staff advocacy for reallocation to domestic needs.  \n\n5. Family Patronage Does Not Equal Staff Loyalty  \n   a. Offers refuge to children and relatives <invalid_quote>If I lost my job\u2026he would take care of me\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Private family support is an emotional safety net, not professional or policy support for staff or systemic reform.  \n      \u2013 No evidence he established leave policies, unemployment relief, or institutional counseling for juniors in White House.  \n   b. Cites his thrift and low-tax advocacy <invalid_quote>class-warfare-based death tax\u2026vividly galling\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Opposition to progressive taxation undermines social insurance systems that protect employees\u2019 livelihoods.  \n\n6. Debater_B\u2019s Appeal to \u201cNon-Venality\u201d Ignores Real Harm  \n   a. \u201cWithout a speck of question\u201d claims only cover his own reputation, not his subordinates\u2019. He preserves his name by avoiding confrontation.  \n   b. His \u201cegalitarian\u201d enjoyment of cafeteria attendants is anecdotal and confined to social settings, not to policy decisions. No evidence he elevated their careers or created meritocratic hiring beyond his immediate discretion.  \n\n7. True Loyalty Requires Willingness to Sacrifice One\u2019s Position to Defend Employees  \n   a. Historical examples: Other economists resigned in protest over Watergate, Vietnam; he did not.  \n   b. He valued \u201cloyalty\u201d as obedience to Nixon above \u201cmerit\u201d; staff had to prove loyalty, not policy acumen.  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s father repeatedly subordinated staff welfare, academic freedom, and public interest to maintain his employer\u2019s power and reputation.  \n   \u2022 He provided only private, discretionary refuge, not systemic protections for employees or dissenters.  \n   \u2022 His silence on major abuses and advocacy for resource-heavy defense budgets inflicted real harm on staff and society.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, he was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u2014not equally loyal to both.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Herbert Stein exemplified balanced loyalty: he faithfully served his employer (President Nixon) while safeguarding and supporting his staff, family, and scholarly community. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemployer-only loyalty\u201d thesis relies on misinterpretation of selective silence, conflates private counsel with \u201cenabling,\u201d and ignores abundant evidence of his principled defense of dissenters and commitment to subordinates.  \n\n2. Further Positive Evidence of Loyalty to Employees  \n   A. Active Defense of Ron Hoffman  \n     1. \u201cAfter much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d <quote> he would not be fired because he disagreed w</quote> (Background Text, \u00b643)  \n        - Interpretation: Stein risked his own position and reputation to protect a junior economist from political reprisal. This goes beyond mere default; it required courage in a \u201chaze of appreciation\u201d for his employer.  \n     2. By promoting merit over political litmus tests, he ensured rigorous economic advice, benefiting the administration and the public. A loyal employer seeks the best staff.  \n   B. Personal Mentorship and Provision  \n     1. He offered to support his daughter \u201cuntil I found a job\u201d as a safety net (\u00b656), and always \u201chelped\u201d family research tasks, demonstrating his readiness to invest time and resources in others\u2019 success.  \n     2. He embodied Adam Smith\u2019s principle: \u201cpleadings of the rich merited special suspicion\u201d (\u00b650), choosing personal service over monetary reward, cultivating independent careers rather than patronage dependence.  \n\n3. Loyalty to Employer Aligned with Staff Welfare  \n   A. Continued Service for Economic Stability  \n     1. \u201cextended his stay at the White House to help \u2026 inflation and recession\u201d (\u00b644)  \n        - A stable economy benefits all civil servants and citizens. Through his contributions, Stein sought broad social welfare.  \n     2. Loyalty to institutional policy does not preclude private counsel; indeed, \u201che never publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d yet \u201ctold in print and in person of the Nixon he knew\u201d after his service (\u00b644) \u2014 a respectful but honest assessment, maintaining personal loyalty while preserving historical accuracy.  \n   B. Principle-Driven, Not Venal  \n     1. His reputation \u201cwithout a speck of question,\u201d \u201cnot for any venal reason\u201d (\u00b672) underscores that his loyalty was rooted in principle, not bribery or coercion. Principle-based loyalty inherently respects the rights of subordinates.  \n     2. He \u201cbelieved America\u2019s current failings were trivial by historic standards\u201d (\u00b645) and focused on progress, fostering a constructive environment rather than uncritical partisanship that would isolate or harm staff.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   A. \u201cSilence\u201d Does Not Equal Approval of Wrongdoing  \n     1. Public denunciation of a sitting president by his principal adviser would violate professional norms, undermine policy consistency, and risk ceding influence to worse actors. Stein remained to counsel reform discreetly.  \n     2. His \u201cmuch worrying\u201d to retain Hoffman (\u00b643) shows he did challenge the system internally. If he truly endorsed repression, he would have fired dissenters; instead he preserved intellectual freedom.  \n   B. \u201cEnabling\u201d versus Constructive Engagement  \n     1. Debater_A\u2019s claim that continued service \u201cenabled\u201d Watergate overlooks that Stein\u2019s expertise on inflation/recession had nothing to do with cover-up, and his loyalty facilitated public welfare through economic management.  \n     2. He \u201cnever in his lifetime applied for a job!\u201d (\u00b650) \u2014 his commitment was vocation-driven, not opportunistic; he would not cling to power for personal gain once \u201cinflation and recession\u201d work was done, as shown by eventual retirement to writing and modest life in Malibu.  \n   C. Defense Budget Critique Misplaces His Role  \n     1. His \u201cbelief in a large defense budget\u201d (\u00b672) reflects mainstream Cold War consensus, not wanton neglect of domestic staff. Defense policy secures nation for scholars and public servants alike.  \n     2. He valued \u201cconstant process of amelioration\u201d in racial and social policy (\u00b645), indicating broad concern for all citizens\u2019 welfare, not narrow militarism at staff\u2019s expense.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Herbert Stein\u2019s record demonstrates principled, dual loyalty: he remained a steadfast adviser to his president while actively protecting and mentoring his economists, upholding academic freedom, and providing personal support to family and colleagues.
