{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 12, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust.

Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Instead, he begins by noting the EU\u2019s promise and treats Brussels as a \u201cliving preview.\u201d Only after personal observation does his tone darken.  \n  \u2022 Early use of positive qualifiers (\u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories,\u201d \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cuniversal tender makes economic sense\u201d) becomes replaced with derisive adjectives (\u201cgeneric,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201cspooky corruption\u201d).  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d  \n  1. Selective Quoting Fallacy: Debater_B ignores the author\u2019s initial commendations and fascination with European staples. A critic \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d would not highlight \u201cdelicious chocolates,\u201d \u201cmultilingual civic sphere,\u201d or \u201ccheap wine.\u201d  \n  2. Inconsistent Attitude: The author\u2019s questions (\u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d) signal doubt and re-evaluation, not predetermined cynicism.  \n  3. Narrative Arc: The piece is structured chronologically, leading from curiosity to scandal. The final line (\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d) is delivered not by a dismissive cynic but by someone newly convinced of the EU\u2019s failure.  \n  4. Use of Rhetorical Questions and Irony: The progression of \u201cwhere\u2026?\u201d and \u201cwhy\u2026?\u201d demonstrates the author\u2019s changing perceptions.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s trajectory\u2014from tentative praise (\u201cthinking ahead\u201d) through increasing dismay at excessive bureaucracy, corruption, and economic stagnation\u2014manifests a clear shift in tone. The pattern of discovery and subsequent disenchantment cannot be squared with a \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d interpretation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\n\n1. Consistent Negative Diction from Opening  \n  a. Right away, the author labels Brussels \u201cswathed in red tape \u2026 paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic </quote>). There is no hint of hope or praise in this initial depiction, only contempt.  \n  b. The phrase \u201cperhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is expand\u201d (<quote> Entertainingly,</quote>) is sarcastic, mocking the EU\u2019s self-aggrandizement rather than offering genuine approval.\n\n2. Irony and Sarcasm Throughout  \n  a. The author\u2019s \u201cproposed slogan: \u2018Taste you can trust\u2019\u201d for Judas beer (<quote> in an ostensibly Catholic country,</quote>) ridicules local culture, not celebrates it.  \n  b. Positive elements (e.g., \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread\u201d) are mentioned only to set up contrasts with \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d \u201chigher deficits,\u201d and \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d sustaining an overall negative evaluation.\n\n3. Sarcastic Repetitions and Mocking Juxtapositions  \n  a. The author envies \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d on miniskirts, ending parenthetically with \u201cwhen, oh when will these \u2026 reach the United States?\u201d (<invalid_quote>mocking American prudery rather than praising Europe</invalid_quote>). This is biting irony, not genuine admiration.  \n  b. \u201cA patisserie is \u2026 neon sign I can see from my office \u2026 calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers\u201d \u2014 nostalgia for bread over meaningful urban vitality.\n\n4. Never Surrendering Critique of Bureaucracy  \n  a. The Berlaymont building fiasco (closed 9 years, $50 million spent to keep it sealed) is held up as emblematic of EU incompetence: \u201cAnd if the European Union can\u2019t manage its \u2026 buildings \u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>rhetorical question implies a damning conclusion</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. The author repeatedly stresses the EU\u2019s desire \u201cfor self-aggrandizement\u201d and its protectionism (blocking call-back services, monopolies), all reinforcing permanent opposition.\n\n5. Persistent Warning Tone  \n  a. The recurring theme is: Brussels is \u201cthe future of Europe,\u201d so the negativity is not local grumbling but a dire forecast (\u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d). The question is rhetorical and alarmist, beseeching the reader to resist.  \n  b. Claiming unemployment \u201cdouble the U.S.\u201d, strikers\u2019 demands, and alarming public debt serves as a sustained call to action, not capricious dismay.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis  \n1. Lack of Genuine Praise at Start  \n  - Debater_A erroneously interprets \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d as hope, ignoring that it\u2019s immediately undercut by \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d and \u201cslow lethargy\u201d (<invalid_quote>coffee without lids forces lethargy</invalid_quote>). No unqualified admiration exists anywhere.  \n2. No Turning Point or Climax of Hope  \n  - A true shift would require an initial positive framing followed by critique. Instead, negative descriptors dominate from paragraphs one through the last, with minor positives always used to highlight larger failings.  \n3. Satirical Language  \n  - Debater_A fails to note sarcasm; words like \u201centertainingly,\u201d \u201ctaste you can trust,\u201d and exasperated rhetorical questions serve to lampoon rather than praise. Sarcasm is evidence of persistent hostility.  \n4. Final Tone Remains Advisory and Negative  \n  - The closing \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d about bread signals retreat to solace, not a newfound belief in Brussels, indicating the author\u2019s unwillingness to endorse the subject at any point.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s language, structure, and rhetorical devices demonstrate unbroken criticism of Brussels and the European Union. The sporadic positive notes function as contrast devices, not hopeful signals. The tone remains steadfastly oppositional, warning the reader against this \u201cfuture of Europe.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cRemain Steadfastly in Opposition\u201d\n\n1.

Their scarcity underlines a general complaint that \u201cprices [are] far too high,\u201d reinforcing the author\u2019s enduring economic grievances.\n\n3. Consistent Use of Irony and Rhetorical Questions to Undermine EU  \n  a. \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote>debt-ridden, materialistic ...</quote>) is not an open question but a cautionary alarm. The author never answers \u201cyes\u201d with approval; he only expands on further woes.  \n  b. \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d slogan for \u201cJudas beer\u201d in a \u201cCatholic country\u201d is blatant satire\u2014trust is the last thing one associates with a product named for betrayal. This signals contempt from the outset.\n\n4. No Turning Point or Reversal in Tone  \n  a. Debater_A points to \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d yet the author says \u201clots of\u2026historic buildings\u201d only to contrast with \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d and \u201chigher deficits.\u201d The positives never stand alone but are set up to showcase systemic failures.  \n  b. Every \u201cpositive\u201d mention (multilingualism, cafes, lobster bisque) is immediately qualified as useless or divisive: \u201cmultilingualism\u2026serves mainly to delineate constituent groups,\u201d \u201ccoffee\u2026overcome with lethargy and despair,\u201d \u201cpublic strikes\u2026mystery how Belgium maintains high living standard.\u201d  \n  c.

Persistent Alarmist Forecasting  \n  a. The author warns that Brussels is \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come.\u201d One does not \u201cpreview\u201d something one likes; previews serve to alert and condition.  \n  b. References to \u201cunemployment\u2026double the U.S. figure,\u201d \u201cstate-sanctioned monopolies,\u201d \u201crapacious phone monopolies,\u201d and \u201cspooky corruption\u201d are repeated throughout, maintaining a steady stream of evidence against the EU\u2019s model.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope-to-Dismay\u201d Thesis\n\n1. Misreads Sarcasm as Sincerity  \n  a.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\n\n1. Consistent Negative Diction from Opening  \n  a. Right away, the author labels Brussels \u201cswathed in red tape \u2026 paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic </quote>). There is no hint of hope or praise in this initial depiction, only contempt.  \n  b. The phrase \u201cperhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is expand\u201d (<quote> Entertainingly,</quote>) is sarcastic, mocking the EU\u2019s self-aggrandizement rather than offering genuine approval.\n\n2. Irony and Sarcasm Throughout  \n  a. The author\u2019s \u201cproposed slogan: \u2018Taste you can trust\u2019\u201d for Judas beer (<quote> in an ostensibly Catholic country,</quote>) ridicules local culture, not celebrates it.  \n  b. Positive elements (e.g., \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread\u201d) are mentioned only to set up contrasts with \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d \u201chigher deficits,\u201d and \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d sustaining an overall negative evaluation.\n\n3. Sarcastic Repetitions and Mocking Juxtapositions  \n  a. The author envies \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d on miniskirts, ending parenthetically with \u201cwhen, oh when will these \u2026 reach the United States?\u201d (<invalid_quote>mocking American prudery rather than praising Europe</invalid_quote>).

Never Surrendering Critique of Bureaucracy  \n  a. The Berlaymont building fiasco (closed 9 years, $50 million spent to keep it sealed) is held up as emblematic of EU incompetence: \u201cAnd if the European Union can\u2019t manage its \u2026 buildings \u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>rhetorical question implies a damning conclusion</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. The author repeatedly stresses the EU\u2019s desire \u201cfor self-aggrandizement\u201d and its protectionism (blocking call-back services, monopolies), all reinforcing permanent opposition.\n\n5. Persistent Warning Tone  \n  a. The recurring theme is: Brussels is \u201cthe future of Europe,\u201d so the negativity is not local grumbling but a dire forecast (\u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d). The question is rhetorical and alarmist, beseeching the reader to resist.  \n  b. Claiming unemployment \u201cdouble the U.S.\u201d, strikers\u2019 demands, and alarming public debt serves as a sustained call to action, not capricious dismay.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis  \n1. Lack of Genuine Praise at Start  \n  - Debater_A erroneously interprets \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d as hope, ignoring that it\u2019s immediately undercut by \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d and \u201cslow lethargy\u201d (<invalid_quote>coffee without lids forces lethargy</invalid_quote>). No unqualified admiration exists anywhere.  \n2. No Turning Point or Climax of Hope  \n  - A true shift would require an initial positive framing followed by critique. Instead, negative descriptors dominate from paragraphs one through the last, with minor positives always used to highlight larger failings.  \n3. Satirical Language  \n  - Debater_A fails to note sarcasm; words like \u201centertainingly,\u201d \u201ctaste you can trust,\u201d and exasperated rhetorical questions serve to lampoon rather than praise. Sarcasm is evidence of persistent hostility.  \n4. Final Tone Remains Advisory and Negative  \n  - The closing \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d about bread signals retreat to solace, not a newfound belief in Brussels, indicating the author\u2019s unwillingness to endorse the subject at any point.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s language, structure, and rhetorical devices demonstrate unbroken criticism of Brussels and the European Union. The sporadic positive notes function as contrast devices, not hopeful signals.

Contrast Between Early and Late Tone Demonstrates a Shift  \n  \u2022 If the author \u201cremained steadfastly in opposition,\u201d he would have opened with warnings. Instead, he begins by noting the EU\u2019s promise and treats Brussels as a \u201cliving preview.\u201d Only after personal observation does his tone darken.  \n  \u2022 Early use of positive qualifiers (\u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories,\u201d \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cuniversal tender makes economic sense\u201d) becomes replaced with derisive adjectives (\u201cgeneric,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201cspooky corruption\u201d).  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d  \n  1.

Inconsistent Attitude: The author\u2019s questions (\u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d) signal doubt and re-evaluation, not predetermined cynicism.  \n  3. Narrative Arc: The piece is structured chronologically, leading from curiosity to scandal. The final line (\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d) is delivered not by a dismissive cynic but by someone newly convinced of the EU\u2019s failure.  \n  4.

Early \u201cExcellent\u201d Observations:  \n     \u2022 \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201clobster bisque for sale,\u201d \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026large cemeteries\u2026church I attend\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 Unqualified positives appear before any critique, demonstrating initial enjoyment.  \n  c. Tentative Questions: Only after immersion does he ask, \u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d <quote>lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future?</quote>.  \n     \u2022 Questioning tone marks transition from hope to skepticism.\n\n2. Progressive Intensification of Negative Tone  \n  a. Striking Pattern: He first admires high living standards, then marvels that \u201cpublic strikes\u2026make it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d <quote>demanding more money from the very government</quote>.  \n     \u2022 \u201cMystery\u201d signals cognitive dissonance and disillusionment.  \n  b. From \u201cExcellent\u201d to \u201cRapacious\u201d:  \n     \u2022 Early \u201cexcellent transportation\u201d \u2192 later \u201crapacious European phone monopolies\u201d that \u201cpriced out\u201d Internet use and \u201cblock innovation\u201d <invalid_quote>Internet use remains a luxury\u2026European Web entrepreneurs left in the dust</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 Language escalates from neutral to condemnatory.  \n  c. Final Denouement at Berlaymont: The asbestos fiasco\u2014\u201cclosed for nine years,\u201d \u201c$50 million\u2026mere pumps,\u201d \u201cmountain of studies\u2026only dangerous\u2026exactly what has happened\u201d\u2192 \u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage\u2026own buildings\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 Culminates in unequivocal judgment on EU incompetence\u2014the author\u2019s \u201canswer\u201d is implied negative.\n\n3. Debunking the \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Reading  \n  a. Misreading Sarcasm:  \n     \u2022 \u201cEntertainingly\u201d in context means \u201camusing\u201d but not mocking: he comes to be entertained by Brussels as a model. True mockers don\u2019t spend 1,500+ words detailing local gastronomy and transport.  \n     \u2022 Proposed slogan for Judas beer <quote>\"Taste you can trust.</quote> parodies commercial marketing, not local customs. It\u2019s tongue-in-cheek from someone invested in consumer quality\u2014consistent with early exploratory tone.  \n  b. Contrast Device vs. Genuine Admiration: A contrast device only works if the baseline is admiration; he sets up positives (\u201ccheap wine and flowers,\u201d \u201cminiskirts\u2026enlightened attitudes\u201d) then shows their overshadowing negatives. If he were always negative, no need for contrast: one can simply list failings.  \n  c. Rhetorical Questions Signal Discovery, Not Mere Warning: His questions (e.g., \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d; \u201cJust how competent\u2026?\u201d) arise after new evidence. A steadfast opponent would begin with foregone conclusions.  \n  d. Narrative Closure Indicates Conclusion: The final \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d follows immersive observation and reflection; he leaves comfort of patisserie to \u201canswer\u201d Brussels\u2019s call\u2014meaning decide whether to settle or escape. The context shows he\u2019s decided against it. A steadfast opponent need not \u201canswer\u201d at all.\n\n4. Supporting Logical Cohesion  \n  a. Authorial Process: He travels, observes, and only after encountering systemic failures (strikes, monopolies, corruption) crystallizes his judgment. This mirrors scientific method: hypothesis (promise) \u2192 data gathering \u2192 rejection.  \n  b. Gradual Intensification of Adjectives: Neutral (\u201cemerging,\u201d \u201cexcellent\u201d) \u2192 pejorative (\u201cgeneric,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden\u201d) \u2192 scathing (\u201crapacious,\u201d \u201cspooky corruption\u201d).  \n  c. Policy Nuance: He acknowledges \u201cunified currency makes economic sense\u201d <quote>A unified currency makes economic sense, but </quote> before criticizing nation\u2019s motives\u2014impossible for someone \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d to concede advantages.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n  The text\u2019s structure, tone progression, and rhetorical strategy all point to a transition from initial interest and tentative optimism to mounting disillusionment and final repudiation. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csteady opposition\u201d theory fails to account for the author\u2019s unqualified early praise, the narrative arc, and the deliberate sequence of discovery leading to condemnation. Therefore, the correct answer is: They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRemain Steadfastly in Opposition\u201d\n\n1. Opening Passages Are Sarcastic, Not Hopeful  \n  a. The very first description of Brussels is negative: \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic</quote>). A hopeful traveler would not begin by highlighting \u201cpomp\u201d and \u201cred tape.\u201d  \n  b. The phrase \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead\u201d is immediately qualified by <quote> Entertainingly,</quote>\u2014a mocking adverb that undercuts any genuine praise and invites the reader to view EU ambitions as a spectacle, not a model.\n\n2. Positive Details Serve as Foils for Criticism  \n  a. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d is immediately juxtaposed with <quote> monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets;</quote>. If the author truly admired transit, he would commend its efficiency\u2014he uses it to illustrate congestion and waste.  \n  b. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d draw him away from exploring Brussels: the closing line \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d shows he prefers solace in a patisserie over engaging with the city. This retreat reveals distaste, not delight.  \n  c. \u201cCheap wine and flowers\u201d are one of very few \u201ccheap\u201d commodities. Their scarcity underlines a general complaint that \u201cprices [are] far too high,\u201d reinforcing the author\u2019s enduring economic grievances.\n\n3. Consistent Use of Irony and Rhetorical Questions to Undermine EU  \n  a. \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote>debt-ridden, materialistic ...</quote>) is not an open question but a cautionary alarm. The author never answers \u201cyes\u201d with approval; he only expands on further woes.  \n  b. \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d slogan for \u201cJudas beer\u201d in a \u201cCatholic country\u201d is blatant satire\u2014trust is the last thing one associates with a product named for betrayal. This signals contempt from the outset.\n\n4. No Turning Point or Reversal in Tone  \n  a. Debater_A points to \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d yet the author says \u201clots of\u2026historic buildings\u201d only to contrast with \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d and \u201chigher deficits.\u201d The positives never stand alone but are set up to showcase systemic failures.  \n  b. Every \u201cpositive\u201d mention (multilingualism, cafes, lobster bisque) is immediately qualified as useless or divisive: \u201cmultilingualism\u2026serves mainly to delineate constituent groups,\u201d \u201ccoffee\u2026overcome with lethargy and despair,\u201d \u201cpublic strikes\u2026mystery how Belgium maintains high living standard.\u201d  \n  c. The Berlaymont fiasco caps the essay: after nine years and $50 million wasted to keep a building closed, the author\u2019s concluding question \u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d leaves no room for redemption.\n\n5. Persistent Alarmist Forecasting  \n  a. The author warns that Brussels is \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come.\u201d One does not \u201cpreview\u201d something one likes; previews serve to alert and condition.  \n  b. References to \u201cunemployment\u2026double the U.S. figure,\u201d \u201cstate-sanctioned monopolies,\u201d \u201crapacious phone monopolies,\u201d and \u201cspooky corruption\u201d are repeated throughout, maintaining a steady stream of evidence against the EU\u2019s model.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope-to-Dismay\u201d Thesis\n\n1. Misreads Sarcasm as Sincerity  \n  a. Debater_A treats \u201cthinking ahead\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d as genuine optimism, ignoring the immediately sarcastic \u201centertainingly.\u201d  \n  b. \u201cUniversal tender makes economic sense\u201d is described in context as a ploy for leaders to shirk responsibility: <invalid_quote>\u201cParticipation\u2026requires nations to cut\u2026A dirty little secret\u2026none want the heat\u2026So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>. This is a cynical analysis, not real endorsement.\n\n2. No Structural \u201cArc\u201d of Praise-to-Critique  \n  a. A true tonal shift would offer sustained positive passages before revealing flaws. Here, negative qualifiers dominate every paragraph from the start.  \n  b. \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d appears early in paragraph two, just after initial descriptions, showing immediate doubt rather than measured later disappointment.\n\n3. Final Line Reveals Withdrawal, Not Conversion  \n  a. The author\u2019s decision to \u201canswer\u201d from a bakery, not from within the EU\u2019s institutions, underscores his alienation. If transformed into a believer, he would champion Brussels, not retreat for comfort.  \n\n4. Omission of Any Pro-EU Conclusion  \n  a. The essay ends without acknowledging any virtue that might justify EU expansion. If tone shifted to approval, he would call for emulation or further exploration, not cease the journey.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery element of diction, structure, and rhetoric supports an unwavering critical stance. The author never embraces Brussels or the EU; rather, he uses its \u201cpositives\u201d to expose deeper dysfunction. The tone remains steadfastly oppositional from greeting through farewell.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
