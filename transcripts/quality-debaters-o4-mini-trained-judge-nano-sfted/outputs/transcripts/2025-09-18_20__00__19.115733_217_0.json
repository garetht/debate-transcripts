    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.

He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas.

As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare).

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat were some of the reported events that the author brings up to justify Nash\u2019s undoing?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for Debater_A\u2019s Position  \nProposed Correct Answer: \u201cLewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\u201d\n\nI.

Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBombs, Nudity, Lewd Public Conduct\u201d  \n  1. Irrelevant Temporal Frame:  \n     \u2022 \u201cbombs\u201d refer only to his boyhood: \u201cAs a boy \u2026 building homemade bombs\u201d long before his mathematical career or \u201cundoing.\u201d Juvenile mischief does not illustrate the psychotic \u201cbreakdown\u201d central to Nash\u2019s undoing.  \n  2.

Undermines Completeness:  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s list is too narrow and excludes the defining characteristic of his adult insanity\u2014public communications with extraterrestrials and grandiose delusions, which culminated in decades of institutionalization.  \n\nIII. Logical Coherence and Textual Support  \n  \u2022 The theme of the article is the continuum from genius to madness (\u201cfoli\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u201d) demonstrated by specific public behaviors and delusions.  \n  \u2022 Only by including lewd public acts, nudity, violence, and communications with aliens do we capture the full spectrum of \u201cundoing\u201d that led to expulsion, asylum, and lasting psychotic episodes.  \n\nConclusion  \nOur answer best reflects the text\u2019s focus on Nash\u2019s adult psychotic behaviors\u2014public indecency, violence, bizarre communications, and delusional mathematics\u2014and excludes mere childhood mischief. This complete portrayal is what \u201cjustifies Nash\u2019s undoing.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Position: \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d\n\n1. Key Events Leading to Nash\u2019s Undoing  \n   A. Childhood Bomb\u2010Making  \n      - Nash \u201cenjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - This early risk\u2010taking and disregard for safety foreshadows later security concerns (e.g., Rand expulsion).  \n   B. Lewd Public Conduct and Security Risk  \n      - Nash was \u201cexpelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room near Muscle Beach\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - This behavior directly precipitated his professional ostracism.  \n   C. Public Nudity as Symptom and Professional Embarrassment  \n      - At an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party, Nash \u201cshowed up \u2026 clad only in a diaper\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - Such ostentatious nudity reinforced his reputation for instability and hindered academic collaboration.  \n\n2. Why \u201cExtraterrestrial Communications\u201d and \u201cViolence\u201d Are Not Primary Causal Events  \n   A. Alien Delusions Are Symptoms, Not Triggers  \n      - Nash \u201cthought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [The New York Times]\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>), but this belief emerges after the initial breakdown marked by the Riemann Zeta fiasco. Symptoms of schizophrenia do not cause his undoing; they follow.  \n   B. Physical Violence Toward Wife as Consequence of Madness  \n      - While his cruelty to Alicia (\u201che threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat\u201d <invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>) is reprehensible, it arises in parallel with other psychotic behaviors and is not singled out as the event leading to expulsion or institutionalization.  \n\n3. Logical Consistency and Parsimony  \n   - The collapse of Nash\u2019s career begins with concrete, externally verifiable incidents (bomb accident, public lewdness, nudity) that triggered formal actions (expulsion, arrest, asylum commitments).  \n   - Delusional beliefs and interpersonal violence, while central to his later decades, did not themselves lead to formal professional sanctions until after his public conduct had already branded him unstable.  \n\n4.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat were some of the reported events that the author brings up to justify Nash\u2019s undoing?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Position: \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d\n\n1. Key Events Leading to Nash\u2019s Undoing  \n   A. Childhood Bomb\u2010Making  \n      - Nash \u201cenjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - This early risk\u2010taking and disregard for safety foreshadows later security concerns (e.g., Rand expulsion).  \n   B.

Public Nudity as Symptom and Professional Embarrassment  \n      - At an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party, Nash \u201cshowed up \u2026 clad only in a diaper\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - Such ostentatious nudity reinforced his reputation for instability and hindered academic collaboration.  \n\n2. Why \u201cExtraterrestrial Communications\u201d and \u201cViolence\u201d Are Not Primary Causal Events  \n   A. Alien Delusions Are Symptoms, Not Triggers  \n      - Nash \u201cthought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [The New York Times]\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>), but this belief emerges after the initial breakdown marked by the Riemann Zeta fiasco. Symptoms of schizophrenia do not cause his undoing; they follow.  \n   B. Physical Violence Toward Wife as Consequence of Madness  \n      - While his cruelty to Alicia (\u201che threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat\u201d <invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>) is reprehensible, it arises in parallel with other psychotic behaviors and is not singled out as the event leading to expulsion or institutionalization.  \n\n3. Logical Consistency and Parsimony  \n   - The collapse of Nash\u2019s career begins with concrete, externally verifiable incidents (bomb accident, public lewdness, nudity) that triggered formal actions (expulsion, arrest, asylum commitments).  \n   - Delusional beliefs and interpersonal violence, while central to his later decades, did not themselves lead to formal professional sanctions until after his public conduct had already branded him unstable.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s Extra Elements  \n   A. \u201cExtraterrestrials\u201d Misplaced as Causes  \n      - Alien messages appear only after public breakdown; they cannot explain the initial removal from Rand or poor reception at Columbia.  \n   B. \u201cViolence\u201d Ambiguous and Secondary  \n      - Childhood bomb accident is covered under \u201csending bombs\u201d; domestic violence did not provoke immediate professional consequences, whereas the public indecency did.  \n   C. Over\u2010Attribution to Mathematics  \n      - Debater_A\u2019s inclusion of \u201cmadness\u201d from \u201ccommune with Platonic objects\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>) is speculative philosophy, not a reported event that officials could cite to justify intervention.\n\nConclusion  \n   - The only events explicitly cited as grounds for professional ejection and institutionalization are the homemade bombs, public lewd acts, and bizarre public nudity.  \n   - More obscure delusions and interpersonal violence are consequences or symptoms, not the proximate causes of his undoing.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for Debater_A\u2019s Position  \nProposed Correct Answer: \u201cLewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\u201d\n\nI.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Logical Coherence and Textual Support  \n  \u2022 The theme of the article is the continuum from genius to madness (\u201cfoli\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u201d) demonstrated by specific public behaviors and delusions.  \n  \u2022 Only by including lewd public acts, nudity, violence, and communications with aliens do we capture the full spectrum of \u201cundoing\u201d that led to expulsion, asylum, and lasting psychotic episodes.  \n\nConclusion  \nOur answer best reflects the text\u2019s focus on Nash\u2019s adult psychotic behaviors\u2014public indecency, violence, bizarre communications, and delusional mathematics\u2014and excludes mere childhood mischief. This complete portrayal is what \u201cjustifies Nash\u2019s undoing.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Position: \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d\n\n1. Key Events Leading to Nash\u2019s Undoing  \n   A. Childhood Bomb\u2010Making  \n      - Nash \u201cenjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - This early risk\u2010taking and disregard for safety foreshadows later security concerns (e.g., Rand expulsion).  \n   B. Lewd Public Conduct and Security Risk  \n      - Nash was \u201cexpelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room near Muscle Beach\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - This behavior directly precipitated his professional ostracism.  \n   C. Public Nudity as Symptom and Professional Embarrassment  \n      - At an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party, Nash \u201cshowed up \u2026 clad only in a diaper\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>).  \n      - Such ostentatious nudity reinforced his reputation for instability and hindered academic collaboration.  \n\n2. Why \u201cExtraterrestrial Communications\u201d and \u201cViolence\u201d Are Not Primary Causal Events  \n   A. Alien Delusions Are Symptoms, Not Triggers  \n      - Nash \u201cthought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [The New York Times]\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>), but this belief emerges after the initial breakdown marked by the Riemann Zeta fiasco. Symptoms of schizophrenia do not cause his undoing; they follow.  \n   B. Physical Violence Toward Wife as Consequence of Madness  \n      - While his cruelty to Alicia (\u201che threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat\u201d <invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>) is reprehensible, it arises in parallel with other psychotic behaviors and is not singled out as the event leading to expulsion or institutionalization.  \n\n3. Logical Consistency and Parsimony  \n   - The collapse of Nash\u2019s career begins with concrete, externally verifiable incidents (bomb accident, public lewdness, nudity) that triggered formal actions (expulsion, arrest, asylum commitments).  \n   - Delusional beliefs and interpersonal violence, while central to his later decades, did not themselves lead to formal professional sanctions until after his public conduct had already branded him unstable.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s Extra Elements  \n   A. \u201cExtraterrestrials\u201d Misplaced as Causes  \n      - Alien messages appear only after public breakdown; they cannot explain the initial removal from Rand or poor reception at Columbia.  \n   B. \u201cViolence\u201d Ambiguous and Secondary  \n      - Childhood bomb accident is covered under \u201csending bombs\u201d; domestic violence did not provoke immediate professional consequences, whereas the public indecency did.  \n   C. Over\u2010Attribution to Mathematics  \n      - Debater_A\u2019s inclusion of \u201cmadness\u201d from \u201ccommune with Platonic objects\u201d (<invalid_quote>background</invalid_quote>) is speculative philosophy, not a reported event that officials could cite to justify intervention.\n\nConclusion  \n   - The only events explicitly cited as grounds for professional ejection and institutionalization are the homemade bombs, public lewd acts, and bizarre public nudity.  \n   - More obscure delusions and interpersonal violence are consequences or symptoms, not the proximate causes of his undoing.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A\u2019s Position: \u201cLewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\u201d\n\nI. These Events Are Explicitly Cited as Causes of Undoing  \n  1. Public Lewdness and Nudity as Immediate Triggers  \n     \u2022 \u201cExpelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach.\u201d <quote>lewd act in a public men's room</quote>  \n       \u2013 Text: \u201cThe next year, he was expelled from Rand \u2026\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cNash showed up \u2026 clad only in a diaper\u201d at MIT, undermining his teaching post and reputation. <quote>clad only in a diaper.</quote>  \n       \u2013 Public nudity directly inhibited any academic collaboration or reinstatement.  \n  2. Public Mathematical Breakdown as Professional \u201cUndoing\u201d  \n     \u2022 His 1959 Columbia lecture on the Riemann Zeta conjecture \u201cwas a farrago of mathematical lunacy,\u201d prompting colleagues to reject his work. <quote>It was horrible.</quote>  \n       \u2013 This high-profile failure marks the onset of formal removal from academic standing (\u201cdeclined endowed chair\u201d).  \n  3. Violence and Cruelty Reinforce Security and Asylum Decisions  \n     \u2022 \u201cOnce \u2026 he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat.\u201d <quote>put his foot on her throat.</quote>  \n       \u2013 Domestic violence signals dangerous instability, justifying institutionalization.  \n  4. Delusional Communications with Extraterrestrials as Ongoing Justification  \n     \u2022 He \u201cthought aliens were sending him encrypted messages \u2026\u201d <quote>aliens were sending him encrypted messages</quote>  \n     \u2022 Grandiose world-government schemes (\u201cscheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica\u201d) and runic messages on campus blackboards  \n       \u2013 These persistent delusions kept him in asylums for decades and prevented professional return until remission in the \u201990s.\n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBombs Only\u201d  \n  1. Irrelevance of Childhood Bomb-Making  \n     \u2022 Text: \u201cAs a boy g building homemade bombs\u201d predates Princeton; no professional sanctions until decades later. <quote>As a boy g</quote>  \n     \u2022 Bomb accident foreshadows risk, but no direct evidence that Rand or MIT cited juvenile history in their decisions. Professional action followed adult behaviors.  \n  2. Alien Delusions and Lecture Fiasco Are Not \u201cSymptoms Only\u201d  \n     \u2022 Public, documented breakdown at Columbia was his own \u201cpresentation,\u201d not private symptom. <quote>presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy</quote>  \n     \u2022 The Nobel committee hesitated \u201cdare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d only until his delusions subsided, showing delusions themselves were key to his non-consideration.  \n  3. Violence as More Than \u201cConsequence\u201d  \n     \u2022 Domestic assault at a departmental picnic would have legal/social repercussions; coupled with asylums, it justified continued confinement.  \n     \u2022 \u201cHaunted the campus \u2026 runic messages\u201d <quote>Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah w</quote> required intervention by authorities, not merely colleagues\u2019 pity.  \n  4. Parsimony Requires Inclusion of All Adult Behaviors  \n     \u2022 A full spectrum of adult psychotic behaviors\u2014public indecency, bizarre lectures, violence, delusional communications\u2014paints the only coherent picture of \u201cundoing.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s narrow focus cannot explain why he remained in institutions for \u201cseveral decades of flamboyant lunacy,\u201d <quote>several decades of flamboyant lunacy,</quote>.\n\nIII. Textual Coherence and Purpose  \n  \u2022 Author\u2019s thesis: continuum \u201cfrom mathematical genius to madness\u201d (\u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d). Each cited public act is evidence of this descent. <quote>folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)</quote>  \n  \u2022 Only adult, public, documented events plausibly \u201cjustify\u201d his expulsion, ostracism, and long\u2010term institutionalization until the Nobel Prize \u201cbuoyed\u201d his remission. <quote>for Nash it was pure therapy</quote>  \n\nConclusion  \nOur answer encompasses the full set of publicly documented, causative events\u2014indecent exposure, public mathematical breakdown, violent cruelty, and persistent extraterrestrial delusions\u2014that the background text presents as grounds for professional expulsion and prolonged asylum. Debater_B\u2019s omission of key adult delusional and violent behaviors, and reliance on juvenile bomb-making, fails to account for the documented triggers and sustained \u201cundoing\u201d that define Nash\u2019s descent into madness.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Position: \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d\n\n1. Proximate, Verifiable Triggers of Professional and Legal Sanctions  \n   A. Bomb\u2010Making as Security Concern  \n      \u2022 Nash\u2019s childhood bomb accident \u201caccidentally killed\u201d a peer and presages his \u201csecurity risk\u201d label at Rand (<invalid_quote>building homemade bombs \u2026 one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast</invalid_quote>). This concrete incident establishes official mistrust of Nash as dangerous.  \n   B. Public Lewdness Leading to Expulsion  \n      \u2022 Police \u201ccaught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach,\u201d directly causing his expulsion from Rand (<quote>expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act</quote>).  \n   C. Public Nudity Reinforcing Instability  \n      \u2022 At MIT, Nash \u201cshowed up \u2026 clad only in a diaper\u201d (<quote>clad only in a diaper</quote>), a public spectacle embarrassing to the institution and justifying ongoing marginalization.  \n\n2. Extraneous or Secondary Events Do Not Trigger \u201cUndoing\u201d  \n   A. Alien Delusions Are Post\u2010Breakdown Symptoms  \n      \u2022 Belief in \u201cencrypted messages\u201d from aliens (<invalid_quote>aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [The New York Times]</invalid_quote>) appears only after his professional standing has collapsed. Psychotic symptoms cannot explain the initial formal actions against him.  \n   B. Domestic Violence and Grandiosity Are Consequences, Not Sanctions  \n      \u2022 His violence toward Alicia and grandiose identity claims (e.g., emperor of Antarctica) are described as part of decades\u2010long lunacy, but the text does not cite these as causes for formal legal or academic expulsion. Institutionalization follows mainly when his public acts become unmanageable, as signaled by lewdness and nudity.  \n\n3. Parsimony and Textual Consistency  \n   \u2022 The text emphasizes official reactions (\u201cexpelled,\u201d \u201chospitalized\u201d) in response to public conduct. These actions require observable misbehavior, not private or symbolic delusions.  \n   \u2022 Inclusion of only those events that institutions can witness and sanction aligns with the narrative of \u201cundoing\u201d his career.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Position\n\n1. Juvenile vs. Adult Behavior  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s violence (childhood torture and bombs) while included in our list, conflates juvenile mischief with adult professional demise. However, bomb\u2010making reputation persists into adulthood as rationale for security risk.  \n   \u2022 Adult violence against his wife, though reprehensible, did not lead to expulsion from Rand or MIT; his status already marginalized before these private incidents.  \n\n2. Alien Communications Cannot Be Sanctioned Alone  \n   \u2022 Delusional beliefs in alien messages are not prosecutable nor clearly cited as grounds for expulsion or asylum admission until they accompany disruptive public acts. The judge or academic committee needs tangible offenses.  \n\n3. Omission of \u201cFarrago\u201d Lecture and Identity Claims  \n   \u2022 The failed Riemann Zeta talk and grandiosity are intellectual breakdowns, but as the text notes, he continued at institutions until public indecency forced removal. Intellectual failure alone did not eject him (\u201cthey were bored with it,\u201d \u201cprofessors weren\u2019t impressed\u201d).  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the tangible, public misbehaviors\u2014bomb\u2010making reputation, lewd acts, and nudity\u2014provide institutions with grounds for formal censure and institutionalization. Other facets of his schizophrenia serve to illustrate his mental state but do not themselves justify his \u201cundoing.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
