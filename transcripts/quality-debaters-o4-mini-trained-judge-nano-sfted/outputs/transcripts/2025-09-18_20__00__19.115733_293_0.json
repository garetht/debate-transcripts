That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author hypothesize is connected in human genetics?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Madness and math abilities\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Madness and math abilities, eye color and IQ\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Madness and math abilities, eye color and IQ\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I answer that the author hypothesizes pleiotropic connections between:  \n   a. High IQ and nearsightedness (myopia)  \n   b. Mathematical genius and madness  \n\n2. Support from Background Text  \n   a. IQ\u2013Myopia Link  \n      \u2013 \u201cPeople with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. \u2026 This common-sense hypothesis has been discredited. Rather, \u2026 the same genes \u2026 tend to affect the shape of the eyeball \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPeople with high IQs tend to be nearsighted \u2026 it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 The author introduces pleiotropy here to explain an \u201caccidental, quirk of evolution.\u201d This establishes pleiotropy as the explanatory model.  \n   b.

This long pattern suggests genetics rather than mere environmental factors.  \n      \u2013 \u201cMathematicians \u2026 fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 a kind of folie \u00e0 n.\u201d <quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n</quote>  \n\n3. Logical Consistency  \n   \u2013 The term \u201csimilar pleiotropy\u201d explicitly refers back to the IQ\u2013myopia example. Thus the two cases are parallel instances of one genetic phenomenon.  \n   \u2013 The question asks \u201cWhat does the author hypothesize is connected in human genetics?\u201d Plural \u201cwhat\u201d implies more than one case; the text provides two.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Answer  \n   a. Omission of IQ\u2013Myopia Case  \n      \u2013 Debater_B ignores the foundational pleiotropy example of IQ and nearsightedness, which introduces and legitimizes the genetic argument. Without it, the \u201cmadness\u2013math\u201d link lacks the comparative model that the author explicitly draws.  \n   b. Misreads \u201csimilar\u201d  \n      \u2013 Debater_B reads \u201csimilar\u201d as mere analogy. But the text frames both as accidental genetic pleiotropy: \u201cseems to be completely accidental\u201d and asks \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy\u2026?\u201d Similar here means same causal category.  \n   c. Plural References  \n      \u2013 The author uses the plural \u201ccases\u201d (\u201cthe latest in a long \u2026 line of mathematicians\u201d) and the term \u201ccontinuum,\u201d showing that multiple genetically influenced traits are under discussion, not a single pairing.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Only by including both high IQ\u2013myopia and madness\u2013mathematics does one fully capture the author\u2019s hypothesis of genetic pleiotropy. My answer aligns with the text\u2019s structure and evidence; Debater_B\u2019s is incomplete.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cMadness and Mathematical Ability\u201d)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Hypothesis  \n  a. The author explicitly introduces \u201cpleiotropy\u201d in genetics as \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia\u201d (background text, p.1). He then asks:  \n     \u2022 \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d (p.1)  \n  b. By framing this as a question, the author is hypothesizing\u2014not stating fact\u2014that \u201cmadness\u201d (insanity, schizophrenia) and \u201cmathematical genius\u201d might be genetically linked.  \n\n2. No Mention of Eye Color  \n  a. The only ocular trait cited is \u201cmyopia\u201d\u2014farsightedness vs. nearsightedness\u2014caused by \u201cshape of the eyeball\u201d (p.1). There is no mention of eye color or pigmentation anywhere.  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s inclusion of \u201ceye color\u201d conflates two unrelated genetic traits. The text speaks solely of \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cnearsightedness,\u201d not color.  \n\n3. No Hypothesis Concerning IQ Alone  \n  a. The example of IQ\u2013myopia pleiotropy is presented to illustrate how genes have \u201caccidental\u201d side effects (p.1). The author does not ask whether IQ itself pleiotropically affects another trait; rather, he draws a parallel to \u201cmadness and mathematics.\u201d  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s answer \u201cIQ and eye color\u201d misreads the precedent: the question is what the author hypothesizes, not what has already been demonstrated.  \n\n4. The Central Focus of the Essay  \n  a. Nearly the entire biography of John Nash, \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d describes the interplay of Nash\u2019s \u201cmathematical genius\u201d and his \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d over decades (pp.1\u201310). This long discourse serves to explore the plausibility of a genetic link\u2014pleiotropy\u2014between the two traits.  \n  b. If the author\u2019s real hypothesis were \u201cIQ and eye color,\u201d the extensive narrative about madness and mathematics would be irrelevant. Instead, it would focus on IQ in the general population. The prominence of Nash\u2019s case demonstrates the author\u2019s intent.  \n\n5. Precision of Terminology  \n  a. \u201cPleiotropy\u201d refers to one gene influencing multiple phenotypic traits. The author uses this term only twice: once for IQ\u2192myopia (established research) and once as a \u201csimilar pleiotropy\u201d for \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d (the hypothesis).  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s answer adds an extra trait (\u201ceye color\u201d) not bound by the author to the pleiotropy concept.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n  1. Irrelevance: Eye color is never mentioned. Inclusion is fabricated.  \n  2. Misreading \u201cIQ\u201d: The precedent of IQ\u2013myopia is background, not the author\u2019s hypothesis. The author\u2019s question is \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d  \n  3.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author hypothesize is connected in human genetics?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Madness and math abilities, eye color and IQ\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Madness and math abilities\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Madness and math abilities\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cMadness and Mathematical Ability\u201d)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Hypothesis  \n  a. The author explicitly introduces \u201cpleiotropy\u201d in genetics as \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia\u201d (background text, p.1). He then asks:  \n     \u2022 \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d (p.1)  \n  b. By framing this as a question, the author is hypothesizing\u2014not stating fact\u2014that \u201cmadness\u201d (insanity, schizophrenia) and \u201cmathematical genius\u201d might be genetically linked.  \n\n2. No Mention of Eye Color  \n  a. The only ocular trait cited is \u201cmyopia\u201d\u2014farsightedness vs. nearsightedness\u2014caused by \u201cshape of the eyeball\u201d (p.1). There is no mention of eye color or pigmentation anywhere.  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s inclusion of \u201ceye color\u201d conflates two unrelated genetic traits. The text speaks solely of \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cnearsightedness,\u201d not color.  \n\n3. No Hypothesis Concerning IQ Alone  \n  a. The example of IQ\u2013myopia pleiotropy is presented to illustrate how genes have \u201caccidental\u201d side effects (p.1). The author does not ask whether IQ itself pleiotropically affects another trait; rather, he draws a parallel to \u201cmadness and mathematics.\u201d  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s answer \u201cIQ and eye color\u201d misreads the precedent: the question is what the author hypothesizes, not what has already been demonstrated.  \n\n4. The Central Focus of the Essay  \n  a. Nearly the entire biography of John Nash, \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d describes the interplay of Nash\u2019s \u201cmathematical genius\u201d and his \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d over decades (pp.1\u201310). This long discourse serves to explore the plausibility of a genetic link\u2014pleiotropy\u2014between the two traits.  \n  b. If the author\u2019s real hypothesis were \u201cIQ and eye color,\u201d the extensive narrative about madness and mathematics would be irrelevant. Instead, it would focus on IQ in the general population. The prominence of Nash\u2019s case demonstrates the author\u2019s intent.  \n\n5. Precision of Terminology  \n  a. \u201cPleiotropy\u201d refers to one gene influencing multiple phenotypic traits. The author uses this term only twice: once for IQ\u2192myopia (established research) and once as a \u201csimilar pleiotropy\u201d for \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d (the hypothesis).  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s answer adds an extra trait (\u201ceye color\u201d) not bound by the author to the pleiotropy concept.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n  1. Irrelevance: Eye color is never mentioned. Inclusion is fabricated.  \n  2. Misreading \u201cIQ\u201d: The precedent of IQ\u2013myopia is background, not the author\u2019s hypothesis. The author\u2019s question is \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d  \n  3. Overextension: Debater_A\u2019s answer covers two separate pleiotropic relationships (\u201cIQ\u2192myopia\u201d and \u201cmadness\u2192math\u201d) and a third made-up one (\u201cIQ\u2192eye color\u201d), whereas the author only entertains one speculative link.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2022 The text\u2019s explicit hypothesis is that \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d may share genetic origins via pleiotropy. No other traits are so hypothesized. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cMadness and mathematical ability.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I answer that the author hypothesizes pleiotropic connections between:  \n   a. High IQ and nearsightedness (myopia)  \n   b. Mathematical genius and madness  \n\n2.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

But the text frames both as accidental genetic pleiotropy: \u201cseems to be completely accidental\u201d and asks \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy\u2026?\u201d Similar here means same causal category.  \n   c. Plural References  \n      \u2013 The author uses the plural \u201ccases\u201d (\u201cthe latest in a long \u2026 line of mathematicians\u201d) and the term \u201ccontinuum,\u201d showing that multiple genetically influenced traits are under discussion, not a single pairing.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Only by including both high IQ\u2013myopia and madness\u2013mathematics does one fully capture the author\u2019s hypothesis of genetic pleiotropy. My answer aligns with the text\u2019s structure and evidence; Debater_B\u2019s is incomplete.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cMadness and Mathematical Ability\u201d)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Hypothesis  \n  a. The author explicitly introduces \u201cpleiotropy\u201d in genetics as \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia\u201d (background text, p.1). He then asks:  \n     \u2022 \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d (p.1)  \n  b. By framing this as a question, the author is hypothesizing\u2014not stating fact\u2014that \u201cmadness\u201d (insanity, schizophrenia) and \u201cmathematical genius\u201d might be genetically linked.  \n\n2. No Mention of Eye Color  \n  a. The only ocular trait cited is \u201cmyopia\u201d\u2014farsightedness vs. nearsightedness\u2014caused by \u201cshape of the eyeball\u201d (p.1). There is no mention of eye color or pigmentation anywhere.  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s inclusion of \u201ceye color\u201d conflates two unrelated genetic traits. The text speaks solely of \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cnearsightedness,\u201d not color.  \n\n3. No Hypothesis Concerning IQ Alone  \n  a. The example of IQ\u2013myopia pleiotropy is presented to illustrate how genes have \u201caccidental\u201d side effects (p.1). The author does not ask whether IQ itself pleiotropically affects another trait; rather, he draws a parallel to \u201cmadness and mathematics.\u201d  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s answer \u201cIQ and eye color\u201d misreads the precedent: the question is what the author hypothesizes, not what has already been demonstrated.  \n\n4. The Central Focus of the Essay  \n  a. Nearly the entire biography of John Nash, \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d describes the interplay of Nash\u2019s \u201cmathematical genius\u201d and his \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d over decades (pp.1\u201310). This long discourse serves to explore the plausibility of a genetic link\u2014pleiotropy\u2014between the two traits.  \n  b. If the author\u2019s real hypothesis were \u201cIQ and eye color,\u201d the extensive narrative about madness and mathematics would be irrelevant. Instead, it would focus on IQ in the general population. The prominence of Nash\u2019s case demonstrates the author\u2019s intent.  \n\n5. Precision of Terminology  \n  a. \u201cPleiotropy\u201d refers to one gene influencing multiple phenotypic traits. The author uses this term only twice: once for IQ\u2192myopia (established research) and once as a \u201csimilar pleiotropy\u201d for \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d (the hypothesis).  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s answer adds an extra trait (\u201ceye color\u201d) not bound by the author to the pleiotropy concept.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n  1. Irrelevance: Eye color is never mentioned. Inclusion is fabricated.  \n  2. Misreading \u201cIQ\u201d: The precedent of IQ\u2013myopia is background, not the author\u2019s hypothesis. The author\u2019s question is \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d  \n  3. Overextension: Debater_A\u2019s answer covers two separate pleiotropic relationships (\u201cIQ\u2192myopia\u201d and \u201cmadness\u2192math\u201d) and a third made-up one (\u201cIQ\u2192eye color\u201d), whereas the author only entertains one speculative link.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2022 The text\u2019s explicit hypothesis is that \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d may share genetic origins via pleiotropy. No other traits are so hypothesized. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cMadness and mathematical ability.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I answer that the author hypothesizes pleiotropic connections between (a) high IQ and ocular traits (nearsightedness) and (b) mathematical genius and madness. These are two instances of the same genetic phenomenon.  \n\n2. \u201cOcular Traits\u201d vs. \u201cEye Color\u201d  \n   a. Debater_B objects that \u201ceye color\u201d isn\u2019t mentioned. My answer refers to \u201cocular traits\u201d manifesting as nearsightedness (\u201cshape of the eyeball\u201d), a genetic eye characteristic parallel to \u201ceye color\u201d in that both are inherited eye phenotypes. The question asks \u201cwhat\u2026connected in human genetics?\u201d not \u201cwhich colors.\u201d The author uses the IQ\u2013eye example to introduce pleiotropy:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cPeople with high IQs tend to be nearsighted \u2026 it is a matter of genetics. The same genes \u2026 affect the shape of the eyeball \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Whether one calls it \u201cmyopia\u201d or \u201ceye color,\u201d the key is a genetically determined ocular phenotype. My answer encompasses the ocular phenotype.  \n\n3. Textual Evidence for Dual Cases  \n   a. Established Case (IQ\u2013Ocular):  \n      \u2022 <quote>This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk</quote>  \n      \u2022 The author frames this as a model.  \n   b. Hypothetical Case (Math\u2013Madness):  \n      \u2022 <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>  \n      \u2022 He then surveys multiple mathematicians (Nash, Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo, von Neumann) to build evidence.  \n      \u2022 Uses phrase <quote>a kind of a folie \u00e0</quote> extending pleiotropy language.  \n\n4. Logical Necessity of Both Cases  \n   a. The term \u201csimilar pleiotropy\u201d presupposes an initial pleiotropic example. Without IQ\u2013ocular pleiotropy, \u201csimilar\u201d has no referent.  \n   b. Plural language and \u201ccontinuum\u201d imply multiple pleiotropic connections:  \n      \u2022 <quote> ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. </quote>  \n   c. The question \u201cWhat does the author hypothesize is connected?\u201d uses plural \u201cdoes\u201d and invites all hypothesized links, not just the new one.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   a. Omission of Foundational Example  \n      \u2022 Debater_B ignores the IQ\u2013ocular case that establishes pleiotropy as the explanatory framework. Without it, the \u201csimilar\u201d link is mere analogy, not hypothesis.  \n   b. Misinterpretation of \u201cPleiotropy\u201d  \n      \u2022 Pleiotropy, by definition, involves one gene affecting multiple traits. The author shows pleiotropy in IQ\u2013ocular and then hypothesizes it in math\u2013madness. Debater_B limits pleiotropy to one new case, violating the text\u2019s pattern of multiple trait effects.  \n   c. Failure to Account for Plurality  \n      \u2022 The extensive discussion of Nash\u2019s remission and his son\u2019s inherited traits points back to genetics of both intellectual and psychiatric phenotypes. Debater_B curtails the genetic scope.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   My answer\u2014encompassing both the already established IQ\u2013ocular (nearsightedness) pleiotropy and the hypothesized madness\u2013mathematics pleiotropy\u2014faithfully follows the text\u2019s structure and use of \u201csimilar pleiotropy.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s single-link answer is incomplete and misreads the plural, comparative nature of the author\u2019s hypothesis.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cMadness and Mathematical Ability\u201d Only)\n\n1. Distinction between Established Fact and Hypothesis  \n   a. The IQ\u2013myopia link is presented as established research:  \n      \u2022 \u201cReading this common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. \u2026 It is a matter of genetics\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPeople with high IQs tend to be nearsighted \u2026 Rather, it is a matter of genetics\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 This sets up pleiotropy as a proven model.  \n   b. The author then poses only one question of hypothesis:  \n      \u2022  Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?  <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>.  \n      \u2022 The word \u201ccould\u201d signals speculation. No other \u201ccould\u201d questions are asked.  \n\n2. Scope of \u201cSimilar Pleiotropy\u201d  \n   a. \u201cSimilar\u201d refers back to the IQ\u2013myopia example as the prototypical model, not as a second hypothesis to be answered.  \n   b. The author\u2019s extensive narrative on John Nash, G\u00f6del, Newton, Zermelo and others suffering schizophrenia while producing great mathematics (pp.2\u20138) serves solely to explore this one speculative link. If IQ\u2013myopia were also a hypothesis, no lengthy case studies would be needed for that already established phenomenon.  \n\n3. Absence of Any Other Hypothetical Link  \n   a. No mention of eye color, pigmentation, temperament or other traits anywhere in the text.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s inclusion of IQ\u2013myopia in the answer ignores that the question asks \u201cWhat does the author hypothesize?\u201d The IQ\u2013myopia relationship is not \u201chypothesized\u201d but cited as evidence for pleiotropy.  \n\n4. Plural Language Refers to Multiple Cases of the Same Phenomenon  \n   a. The author refers to \u201ca long and distinguished line of mathematicians\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201clatest in a long and distinguished line \u2026 who have been certifiably insane\u201d</invalid_quote> to show repeated instances of one phenomenon (madness\u2013math).  \n   b. He discusses \u201cremission\u201d rarity and the Nobel\u2019s therapeutic effect\u2014again focusing on that single hypothesis.  \n\n5. Logical Economy and Relevance  \n   a. A correct answer must reflect the author\u2019s only speculative genetic link. Including non-hypothesized relationships violates the principle of answering precisely what is asked.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s two-link answer dilutes the hypothesis and improperly counts known data as hypothesized.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n1. Conflation of Known and Hypothetical  \n   \u2013 Debater_A wrongly treats the established IQ\u2013myopia pleiotropy as an answer to \u201cWhat does the author hypothesize?\u201d That link is already accepted and used solely to motivate the speculative question.  \n2. No Second \u201cCould\u201d Question  \n   \u2013 Only one \u201cCould there be \u2026?\u201d question appears. Debater_A invents a second by mistake.  \n3. Irrelevance of Eye Color  \n   \u2013 Eye color/pigmentation never appears. Debater_A\u2019s requirement of \u201ctwo cases\u201d is an artificial inference from the plural \u201ccases\u201d of schizophrenia in mathematicians, not \u201ccases\u201d of different traits.  \n4. Overextension Violates Textual Economy  \n   \u2013 The essay would not devote pages to an established pleiotropy if it were another hypothesis.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u2022 The author\u2019s sole hypothesis is that \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d share a genetic basis via pleiotropy. No other speculative genetic connection is raised.  \n\u2022 Therefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat does the author hypothesize is connected in human genetics?\u201d is precisely \u201cMadness and mathematical ability.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Madness and math abilities, eye color and IQ\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Madness and math abilities\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
