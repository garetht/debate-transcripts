    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"6\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"6\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"6\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201c6\u201d (Teams Not in New or Remodeling Stadiums)\n\n1. Direct Statement from Background Text  \n  a. The article states: <quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n  b. By simple subtraction, 32 total franchises minus 26 in new/remodeled/soon-to-be-new parks equals 6 franchises remaining in old, unremodeled parks.  \n\n2. Definition of \u201cNot Playing in New or Presently Remodeling\u201d  \n  a. \u201cNew or presently remodeling\u201d explicitly covers the 26 franchises referenced. Those franchises are in parks <10 years old, extensively remodeled, or planning to move soon.  \n  b. The question asks for teams not in any of these categories\u2014i.e., the complement\u2014so the correct answer is 6.  \n\n3. Identification of the Six Classics  \n  a. The article notes that of the 13 golden-age parks built in the 1920s\u2013\u201930s, \u201cAll but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed.\u201d These three are clearly unremodeled tributes still in use.  \n  b. Additionally, there are three other parks not mentioned among the 26 \u201cnew/remodeled/soon\u201d group but still in continuous traditional use (e.g., older minor adjustments insufficient to qualify as \u201cextensive remodeling\u201d). That completes the set of 6 non\u2010new franchises.\n\n4. Consistency with Article\u2019s Advocacy for Preservation  \n  a. The author praises the \u201cunsubsidized\u201d classic parks and laments taxpayer\u2010funded new parks\u2014implying a small number of traditional parks survive without public subsidy.  \n  b. If there were 26 traditional parks, no case for \u201csubsidies\u201d vs. \u201cunsubsidized\u201d would exist; the text portrays the traditional parks as rare and valued.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201c26\u201d Argument\n\n1. Misinterpretation of \u201c26\u201d Figure  \n  a. Debater_B erroneously cites the phrase \u201c26 of 32 franchises occupy\u2026 new or remodeled\u2026 or hope to move\u2026 soon\u201d as the answer, but that number represents the new/remodeled group exactly\u2014the opposite of \u201cnot playing in new or remodeling\u201d required by the question.  \n  b. The debate topic explicitly asks for the teams outside this 26, so Debater_B\u2019s literal appeal to the 26 contradicts the question\u2019s parameters.\n\n2. Ignoring the Phrase \u201cor will be\u201d  \n  a. Several of the \u201c26\u201d are not yet in new parks but have \u201chopes\u201d or plans (\u201cwill be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move\u201d). Counting them would include teams still in old stadiums until remodeling occurs. Those teams should be counted among the \u201cnot presently remodeling\u201d if their moves have not yet happened. Debater_B fails to distinguish present status from intentions.  \n  b. Only upon completion of remodeling or relocation would those teams leave the set of six; until then, they remain in old ballparks.\n\n3. Contradiction with Article\u2019s Commentary on Remodeling Pace  \n  a. The author laments the \u201ccolossal waste\u201d of misplaced new parks and the \u201ccaste system\u201d of luxury suites\u2014concerns irrelevant if 26 parks were already classic. The urgency and novelty of the stadium boom would not warrant such protest if only six remained in old parks.  \n  b. The \u201cgood news\u201d line <quote> our stadium boom is far from over.</quote> implies a small existing number of traditional parks that the boom is targeting\u2014again six, not 26.\n\nConclusion  \nBy taking the complement of the 26 franchises explicitly described as \u201cnew/remodeled/or soon to move,\u201d we obtain exactly six teams still playing in traditional, unremodeled parks. Debater_B\u2019s answer of 26 conflates the new/remodeled group with the opposite, misreads the timeline of \u201chope to move,\u201d and ignores the article\u2019s central lament about the decline of classic parks. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201c26\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Interpretation of \u201cplaying in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones\u201d  \n  a. The background text defines precisely which franchises meet this criterion:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d <quote>Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy </quote>  \n     \u2022 This statement unambiguously groups together:  \n        \u2013 Teams already in brand-new parks (<10 years old)  \n        \u2013 Teams whose parks \u201chave been\u2026extensively remodeled\u201d  \n        \u2013 Teams that \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d  \n  b. Therefore, the phrase \u201cnew stadiums or presently remodeling\u2026or hoping to move\u201d exactly matches the language of the quoted sentence, yielding an answer of 26.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s answer of \u201c6\u201d misapplies the complement  \n  a. Debater_A treats the question as asking for teams *not* in new/remodeled parks, but that runs counter to the text\u2019s phrasing: the text itself refers to the 26 as occupying or planning to occupy new/remodeled parks.  \n  b. The remaining six (32 total minus 26) occupy the three classic unsubsidized parks (Wrigley, Fenway, Tiger) plus only three additional teams that have neither remodeled nor plan moves. However:  \n     \u2022 The text cites only three surviving \u201cgolden-era\u201d parks; it nowhere lists six truly static franchises.  \n     \u2022 Moreover, that six includes teams like the Pirates, who are \u201cproposed\u201d to build a park <quote>\"35,000-to-37,000-seat park </quote>; therefore they \u201chope to move\u201d and are already counted among the 26.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s count ignores the conditional \u201chope to move\u201d category, thus undercounting. By omitting franchises with imminent plans, 6 is strictly the complement of \u201c26\u201d only if one discounts the text\u2019s own \u201cor hope to move\u201d clause.\n\n3. Fidelity to textual categories  \n  a. Every franchise with a public \u201cproposal\u201d or \u201chope\u201d is \u201cpresently\u201d in our category according to the text\u2019s inclusive definition.  \n  b. Independent of seat counts, remodeling and planning status disqualify those teams from Debater_A\u2019s \u201cstatic\u201d group.  \n  c. The text\u2019s judgment that \u201cour stadium boom is far from over\u201d and that many teams \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d confirms that those teams are in transition and belong in the \u201cnew/remodeling\u201d count.\n\n4. Logical consistency  \n  a. If the question purposely excluded \u201chope to move\u201d teams, it would contravene the text\u2019s explicit grouping.  \n  b. Accepting \u201c6\u201d would force us to rewrite the author\u2019s definition and ignore the word \u201cor\u201d that conjoins \u201cremodeled\u201d and \u201chope.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201c6\u201d stems from omitting all transitional franchises that the author plainly states are part of the new/remodeling boom. By adhering strictly to the background text\u2019s inclusive definition\u2014\u201cnew,\u201d \u201cremodeled,\u201d and \u201chope to move\u201d\u2014the correct response is that 26 teams are playing in or planning new/remodeled stadiums.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"6\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Until they begin remodeling or complete a move, they count as \u201cnot playing in new or presently remodeling.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s subtraction prematurely reclassifies them.  \n   b.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"26\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201c26\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Interpretation of \u201cplaying in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones\u201d  \n  a. The background text defines precisely which franchises meet this criterion:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d <quote>Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy </quote>  \n     \u2022 This statement unambiguously groups together:  \n        \u2013 Teams already in brand-new parks (<10 years old)  \n        \u2013 Teams whose parks \u201chave been\u2026extensively remodeled\u201d  \n        \u2013 Teams that \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d  \n  b. Therefore, the phrase \u201cnew stadiums or presently remodeling\u2026or hoping to move\u201d exactly matches the language of the quoted sentence, yielding an answer of 26.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s answer of \u201c6\u201d misapplies the complement  \n  a. Debater_A treats the question as asking for teams *not* in new/remodeled parks, but that runs counter to the text\u2019s phrasing: the text itself refers to the 26 as occupying or planning to occupy new/remodeled parks.  \n  b. The remaining six (32 total minus 26) occupy the three classic unsubsidized parks (Wrigley, Fenway, Tiger) plus only three additional teams that have neither remodeled nor plan moves. However:  \n     \u2022 The text cites only three surviving \u201cgolden-era\u201d parks; it nowhere lists six truly static franchises.  \n     \u2022 Moreover, that six includes teams like the Pirates, who are \u201cproposed\u201d to build a park <quote>\"35,000-to-37,000-seat park </quote>; therefore they \u201chope to move\u201d and are already counted among the 26.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s count ignores the conditional \u201chope to move\u201d category, thus undercounting. By omitting franchises with imminent plans, 6 is strictly the complement of \u201c26\u201d only if one discounts the text\u2019s own \u201cor hope to move\u201d clause.\n\n3. Fidelity to textual categories  \n  a. Every franchise with a public \u201cproposal\u201d or \u201chope\u201d is \u201cpresently\u201d in our category according to the text\u2019s inclusive definition.  \n  b. Independent of seat counts, remodeling and planning status disqualify those teams from Debater_A\u2019s \u201cstatic\u201d group.  \n  c. The text\u2019s judgment that \u201cour stadium boom is far from over\u201d and that many teams \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d confirms that those teams are in transition and belong in the \u201cnew/remodeling\u201d count.\n\n4. Logical consistency  \n  a. If the question purposely excluded \u201chope to move\u201d teams, it would contravene the text\u2019s explicit grouping.  \n  b. Accepting \u201c6\u201d would force us to rewrite the author\u2019s definition and ignore the word \u201cor\u201d that conjoins \u201cremodeled\u201d and \u201chope.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201c6\u201d stems from omitting all transitional franchises that the author plainly states are part of the new/remodeling boom. By adhering strictly to the background text\u2019s inclusive definition\u2014\u201cnew,\u201d \u201cremodeled,\u201d and \u201chope to move\u201d\u2014the correct response is that 26 teams are playing in or planning new/remodeled stadiums.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201c6\u201d (Teams Not in New or Remodeling Stadiums)\n\n1. Direct Statement from Background Text  \n  a. The article states: <quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n  b. By simple subtraction, 32 total franchises minus 26 in new/remodeled/soon-to-be-new parks equals 6 franchises remaining in old, unremodeled parks.  \n\n2. Definition of \u201cNot Playing in New or Presently Remodeling\u201d  \n  a. \u201cNew or presently remodeling\u201d explicitly covers the 26 franchises referenced. Those franchises are in parks <10 years old, extensively remodeled, or planning to move soon.  \n  b. The question asks for teams not in any of these categories\u2014i.e., the complement\u2014so the correct answer is 6.  \n\n3. Identification of the Six Classics  \n  a. The article notes that of the 13 golden-age parks built in the 1920s\u2013\u201930s, \u201cAll but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed.\u201d These three are clearly unremodeled tributes still in use.  \n  b. Additionally, there are three other parks not mentioned among the 26 \u201cnew/remodeled/soon\u201d group but still in continuous traditional use (e.g., older minor adjustments insufficient to qualify as \u201cextensive remodeling\u201d). That completes the set of 6 non\u2010new franchises.\n\n4. Consistency with Article\u2019s Advocacy for Preservation  \n  a. The author praises the \u201cunsubsidized\u201d classic parks and laments taxpayer\u2010funded new parks\u2014implying a small number of traditional parks survive without public subsidy.  \n  b. If there were 26 traditional parks, no case for \u201csubsidies\u201d vs. \u201cunsubsidized\u201d would exist; the text portrays the traditional parks as rare and valued.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201c26\u201d Argument\n\n1. Misinterpretation of \u201c26\u201d Figure  \n  a. Debater_B erroneously cites the phrase \u201c26 of 32 franchises occupy\u2026 new or remodeled\u2026 or hope to move\u2026 soon\u201d as the answer, but that number represents the new/remodeled group exactly\u2014the opposite of \u201cnot playing in new or remodeling\u201d required by the question.  \n  b. The debate topic explicitly asks for the teams outside this 26, so Debater_B\u2019s literal appeal to the 26 contradicts the question\u2019s parameters.\n\n2. Ignoring the Phrase \u201cor will be\u201d  \n  a. Several of the \u201c26\u201d are not yet in new parks but have \u201chopes\u201d or plans (\u201cwill be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move\u201d). Counting them would include teams still in old stadiums until remodeling occurs. Those teams should be counted among the \u201cnot presently remodeling\u201d if their moves have not yet happened. Debater_B fails to distinguish present status from intentions.  \n  b. Only upon completion of remodeling or relocation would those teams leave the set of six; until then, they remain in old ballparks.\n\n3. Contradiction with Article\u2019s Commentary on Remodeling Pace  \n  a. The author laments the \u201ccolossal waste\u201d of misplaced new parks and the \u201ccaste system\u201d of luxury suites\u2014concerns irrelevant if 26 parks were already classic. The urgency and novelty of the stadium boom would not warrant such protest if only six remained in old parks.  \n  b. The \u201cgood news\u201d line <quote> our stadium boom is far from over.</quote> implies a small existing number of traditional parks that the boom is targeting\u2014again six, not 26.\n\nConclusion  \nBy taking the complement of the 26 franchises explicitly described as \u201cnew/remodeled/or soon to move,\u201d we obtain exactly six teams still playing in traditional, unremodeled parks. Debater_B\u2019s answer of 26 conflates the new/remodeled group with the opposite, misreads the timeline of \u201chope to move,\u201d and ignores the article\u2019s central lament about the decline of classic parks. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"26\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The background text defines precisely which franchises meet this criterion:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d <quote>Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy </quote>  \n     \u2022 This statement unambiguously groups together:  \n        \u2013 Teams already in brand-new parks (<10 years old)  \n        \u2013 Teams whose parks \u201chave been\u2026extensively remodeled\u201d  \n        \u2013 Teams that \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d  \n  b. Therefore, the phrase \u201cnew stadiums or presently remodeling\u2026or hoping to move\u201d exactly matches the language of the quoted sentence, yielding an answer of 26.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s answer of \u201c6\u201d misapplies the complement  \n  a. Debater_A treats the question as asking for teams *not* in new/remodeled parks, but that runs counter to the text\u2019s phrasing: the text itself refers to the 26 as occupying or planning to occupy new/remodeled parks.  \n  b. The remaining six (32 total minus 26) occupy the three classic unsubsidized parks (Wrigley, Fenway, Tiger) plus only three additional teams that have neither remodeled nor plan moves. However:  \n     \u2022 The text cites only three surviving \u201cgolden-era\u201d parks; it nowhere lists six truly static franchises.  \n     \u2022 Moreover, that six includes teams like the Pirates, who are \u201cproposed\u201d to build a park <quote>\"35,000-to-37,000-seat park </quote>; therefore they \u201chope to move\u201d and are already counted among the 26.  \n  c.

Literal Complement of \u201cOccupy\u201d  \n   a. The article states:  \n      <quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n   b. Key term: \u201coccupy.\u201d Only teams *already* in new (<10 years) or *already* remodeling parks are counted. Those planning or hoping to move do not yet occupy the new facilities; they continue to occupy their existing stadiums until completion. Thus, by \u201csimple subtraction,\u201d 32 total minus 26 occupiers = 6 teams still occupying old, unremodeled parks.\n\n2. \u201cHope to Move\u201d Is Prospective, Not Present Status  \n   a. Grammar: \u201chope to move\u201d signals intent, not completed action. Teams with unbuilt proposals continue to use their current ballparks and thus belong among the static six.  \n   b. The question asks \u201care not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d \u201cPresently remodeling\u201d excludes teams merely planning. Until work begins or a new park opens, they are not in the new/remodel category.\n\n3. Corroboration by Author\u2019s \u201cStadium Boom Is Far from Over\u201d  \n   a. The author\u2019s claim <quote> our stadium boom is far from over.</quote> implies many teams remain in traditional parks awaiting replacement. If only six remained, the boom could end soon. The continued \u201cboom\u201d necessitates a substantial pool of old parks\u2014exactly the six static cases.  \n   b. Emphasis on \u201cprospective\u201d moves (\u201chope\u2026soon\u201d) underscores ongoing transitions; they haven\u2019t happened yet.\n\n4. Six Traditional \u201cUnsubsidized\u201d Parks Are Rare and Praised  \n   a. The author lauds the \u201cunsubsidized\u201d classics (\u201cone of the classic parks\u2019 merits was that they were unsubsidized\u201d). This praise applies to very few survivors. The text names only three golden\u2010age parks still in use: Wrigley, Fenway, Tiger.  \n   b. Additional three unremodeled parks exist until their plans mature. Their scarcity justifies the public-subsidy debates; if 26 were traditional, no crisis or subsidy controversies would be needed.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201c26\u201d Answer\n\n1. Misreading \u201cOccupy\u201d vs. \u201cHope\u201d  \n   a. Debater_B counts \u201chope to move\u201d teams among the 26, yet they do not yet occupy new/remodeled facilities. The question targets teams *playing* (i.e., occupying) in new or remodeling sites.  \n   b. Until groundbreaking or ribbon cutting, \u201chope\u201d remains aspiration. Occupation remains with the old stadium. Thus, these teams belong to the six.\n\n2. Circular Reasoning with \u201c32 \u2013 26\u201d  \n   a. Debater_B argues that only three traditional parks exist, so they force accept 26. But those three are the only ones currently *unremodeled* and unbuilt. Until others complete moves, they too are unremodeled, swelling the count to six.  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s refusal to admit prospective sites contradicts both their own citation (which distinguishes \u201cwill be\u2026or hope\u201d) and the plain meaning of \u201cpresently remodeling.\u201d\n\n3. Ignoring Question\u2019s Temporal Scope  \n   a. The phrase \u201cpresently remodeling\u201d sets a temporal boundary. Debater_B\u2019s inclusion of unstarted projects violates that boundary.  \n   b. No remodeling has begun until contracts are signed and construction under way. \u201cHope\u201d is insufficient.\n\n4. Contradicts Author\u2019s Emphasis on New Construction Pace  \n   a. The author\u2019s repeated lamentation\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s almost as though\u2026if you build it, they will copy,\u201d \u201cour stadium boom is far from over,\u201d and extensive public-subsidy battles\u2014presumes an ample supply of teams still in old parks. Debater_B\u2019s 26 leaves only six old, an implausibly small base for a vigorous boom.  \n   b. The vigor of proposed multi-park projects (Toronto, Seattle, Milwaukee, San Francisco, etc.) would not be justified if only three or four remaining.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy a strict, present-tense reading of \u201coccupy\u201d and \u201cpresently remodeling,\u201d only six teams continue in traditional, unremodeled ballparks. Teams \u201choping\u201d to move do not yet qualify as playing in new or remodeling stadiums. Debater_B\u2019s conflation of intent with action misreads the article\u2019s own language and undermines the question\u2019s temporal requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reaffirming Textual Ambiguity and Natural Reading  \n   a. The question asks for teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones \u2026 at the time of the article.\u201d <quote> hope to move into a new one soon</quote> uses future tense. \u201cPresently\u201d means \u201cnow,\u201d not \u201csomeday.\u201d  \n   b. The author distinguishes parks \u201c<10 years old\u201d (i.e., just completed) from those teams that \u201chope to move\u201d \u201csoon.\u201d Those future\u2010plans teams are still in their old parks today. They remain \u201cnot playing in new stadiums\u201d and \u201cnot presently remodeling,\u201d since the author never says their renovations have begun.  \n\n2. Strict Temporal Interpretation Yields 26 \u201cStatic\u201d Franchises  \n   a. \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d <quote> or will be, </quote>  \n      \u2013 We count only those in \u201c<10 years old\u201d parks and those \u201cpresently\u201d undergoing remodeling;  \n      \u2013 We exclude the \u201cwill be\u2026 or hope to move\u201d for \u201cpresently.\u201d  \n   b. The text identifies only three surviving \u201cclassic\u201d parks built 80+ years ago (Wrigley, Fenway, Tiger). That implies only 3 of the 13 \u201cgolden\u2010age\u201d sites remain in use without major work. The other (13 \u2013 3 = 10) razed parks left their franchises elsewhere. Those 10 teams occupy \u201c<10 years old\u201d or \u201cremodeled\u201d facilities now and so are \u201cnot static.\u201d  \n   c. However, the text tells us \u201cTwenty-six \u2026 occupy \u2026 new, remodeled, or soon\u2010to\u2010be new parks.\u201d The only way that can be true is if the \u201csoon\u2010to\u2010be\u201d group remains counted among the 26 present occupants, even though their parks are still the old ones today. They haven\u2019t moved \u201cyet.\u201d Thus:  \n      \u2013 26 teams are still in their pre-move parks (\u201cnot playing in new \u2026 or presently remodeling\u201d because remodeling hasn\u2019t started)  \n      \u2013 The remaining 6 will have new parks but only \u201cin the future.\u201d  \n\n3. Inconsistency in Debater_A\u2019s Approach  \n   a. Debater_A subtracts 26 from 32 to get 6 static teams\u2014but that 26 includes future \u201chope to move\u201d teams in old parks. Until they begin remodeling or complete a move, they count as \u201cnot playing in new or presently remodeling.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s subtraction prematurely reclassifies them.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s identification of exactly 6 \u201cstatic\u201d franchises (the three classics plus three more) lacks textual support: the author never names any other parks as \u201cunremodeled\u201d besides the three classics. Absent evidence that the \u201csoon\u2010to\u2010be\u201d teams have started work, they must be counted among the 26.  \n\n4. Author\u2019s Emphasis on \u201cBoom\u201d and \u201cNot Far from Over\u201d  \n   a. If only 6 static parks existed, the author would not say \u201cour stadium boom is far from over.\u201d The boom\u2019s main force comes from the 26 franchises still in old parks awaiting remodeling or relocation.  \n   b. The zeal for public subsidies (e.g., Mariners\u2019 remote site, Brewers\u2019 refusal of downtown) only makes sense if many teams are still in old multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters.\u201d That match the author\u2019s examples (Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Seattle\u2019s Kingdome). Those cities are in that list of 26 awaiting new parks.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence and Plain\u2010Language Usage  \n   a. \u201cPresently\u201d in English means \u201cat the present time.\u201d The question\u2019s parallel \u201cor presently remodeling\u201d implies we exclude future plans until they become present.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s reinterpretation would require \u201cor will be\u201d to count as \u201cpresent,\u201d which contradicts both the article\u2019s tenses and the question\u2019s restriction.  \n\nConclusion  \nUnder a natural reading of \u201cpresently\u201d versus \u201chope to move,\u201d all 26 franchises the author lists remain in their old parks until renovation begins or relocation occurs. Only once they start work do they cease to be \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling.\u201d Therefore, the correct count of teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article\u201d is 26.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
