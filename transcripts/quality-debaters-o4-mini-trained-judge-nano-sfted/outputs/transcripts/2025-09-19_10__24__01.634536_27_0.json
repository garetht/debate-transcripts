A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: The statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is the one that is not true about Keynes. In contrast, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is a true statement and thus not a valid answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\nI. Keynes Did Oversimplify\u2014His Own Writings Invite Simplification  \n1. \u201cPolish and perspective can come in due course,\u201d Keynes allowed himself \u201cpoetic license\u201d because his ideas were \u201csomewhat rough\u201d (background, \u00b61).  \n   a. By his own admission, his initial models were deliberately crude.  \n   b. That very crudeness spawned the entire tradition of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d\u2014a caricature even he did not intend (\u00b61\u20132).\n\n2. Early Keynesians produced well-known paradoxes precisely because of oversimplification:  \n   a. \u201cParadox of thrift\u201d implies higher savings always reduce total investment (\u00b66).  \n   b. \u201cWidow\u2019s cruse\u201d suggests raising wages automatically boosts employment (\u00b67).  \n   c. These paradoxes disappear once one restores realistic feedbacks or active monetary policy (\u00b68\u20139).\n\n3. Keynes\u2019s oversimplification was a feature, not a bug:  \n   a. It \u201cseems to take us into a looking-glass world\u201d where self-indulgence is rewarded (\u00b65).  \n   b. Only later refinements, and ultimately Fed activism (e.g., Greenspan), remove these implausible implications (\u00b68\u20139).\n\n4. If Keynes \u201cnever oversimplified,\u201d we would never see these paradoxes in leading textbooks nor widespread public misunderstandings (\u00b610, 13). Their very pervasiveness proves he did oversimplify.\n\nII. Active Monetary Policy Nullifies His Short-Run Models  \n1. \u201cIn reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates\u201d so \u201cmost changes in demand will be offset\u201d (\u00b68).  \n2. Therefore his crude model, which treats interest rates as purely a function of liquidity preference independent of output, does not describe modern economies (\u00b68\u20139).  \n3. Any model that neglects this decisive policy tool is an oversimplification and thus unfit as a general guide.\n\nIII. \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Is True and Uncontroversial  \n1. Microeconomic theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d before 1936 (\u00b63). Keynes deliberately confined himself to macro issues: \u201cmacro-economics was in a state of arrested development\u201d (\u00b63\u20134).  \n2. He \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run\u201d classical theories might hold (\u00b64). That concession shows he did not attempt to replace micro theory.  \n3. No substantive contribution to micro theory appears in The General Theory: all his \u201cparadoxes\u201d concern economy-wide output, employment, and interest rates.  \n4. Modern microeconomics remains grounded in pre-Keynesian foundations; his influence is felt only through macro-theory and its policy implications.\n\nIV. Objections to My Position Are Misguided  \n1. Objection: \u201cKeynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory required micro foundations; that is a micro innovation.\u201d  \n   Response: Liquidity preference concerns aggregate money demand, not individual market allocation. It holds \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d and only shifts its short-run path (\u00b65).  \n2. Objection: \u201cKeynes\u2019s general equilibrium rejection influenced micro across fields.\u201d  \n   Response: Even if his philosophy inspired later micro work, the question asks what is not true *about Keynes* himself. He did not *explicitly* present new micro models; he inspired others later.\n\nV. Conclusion  \nBecause Keynes himself admitted\u2014and indeed relied on\u2014the intentional roughness of his early models, which generated famous paradoxes only resolved by later refinements and active Fed policy, it is not true that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d By contrast, it is indisputable that his landmark work addressed macroeconomics, not micro theory, so the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is true and therefore not a candidate for \u201cwhat is not true about Keynes.\u201d I urge the Judge to select \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d as the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI propose that the statement \u201cKeynes brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true\u2014and that this is the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d My opponent (Debater_A) insists that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is the false statement, but that directly contradicts the background text, which repeatedly emphasizes that Keynes\u2019s followers created crude caricatures and paradoxes by oversimplifying his \u201cspirit\u201d and \u201cvision.\u201d Meanwhile, there is no evidence that Keynes himself significantly advanced microeconomic theory; indeed, the text flatly states that before The General Theory, \u201ceconomists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics,\u201d and that Keynes only addressed \u201cmacro\u2010 wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps\u201d (\u00b63\u20134).  \n\nMy Argument That \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d Is False  \n1. Background Text Confirmation  \n   \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 microeconomics \u2026 [was] in a state of arrested development\u201d only applying to macro (\u00b63\u20134).  \n   \u2022 Keynes \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run \u2026 classical theories might indeed be valid\u201d (\u00b65).  He explicitly works within the classical micro framework for \u201csavings and investment\u201d equality.  \n   \u2022 All the celebrated \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d paradoxes concern aggregate demand, not supply or individual market behavior (\u00b67\u20139). These do not amount to genuine micro theory but to macro prescriptions about total employment and output.  \n\n2. The Visible Hand Argument  \n   \u2022 Restoring the classical long\u2010run equilibrium via Fed policy (\u00b611\u201313) shows the classical micro mechanism remains intact once interest rates are managed. Keynes\u2019s own proponents effectively concede they are operating \u201cwithin\u201d that micro framework, merely shifting demand.  \n   \u2022 If Keynes had introduced true micro innovations, we would not need to \u201crestore\u201d classical models to explain unemployment or trade\u2010balance neutrality under Fed control.  \n\n3. Contemporary Consensus  \n   \u2022 \u201cFew economists take [the paradoxes] seriously these days\u201d (\u00b610).  Genuine micro innovations would endure. Their disappearance indicates these were pedagogical curiosities, not foundational micro contributions.  \n   \u2022 The text contrasts \u201cfreshman textbooks\u201d recycling crude Keynesian paradoxes with \u201cthe world of academic economics\u201d that treats things classically under Fed influence (\u00b610\u201311).  True micro theory would be embraced by academic economics, not only by na\u00efve \u201cvulgar Keynesians.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d Defense  \n1. Textual Admission of Oversimplification  \n   \u2022 \u201cIf his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity \u2026 Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably \u2026 become increasingly simplistic \u2026 a crude caricature of the original\u201d (\u00b61).  This directly admits oversimplification.  \n   \u2022 The label \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d is defined as confusing debate by following the \u201cletter\u201d but misunderstanding the \u201cspirit\u201d (\u00b62).  That is oversimplification by Keynes\u2019s own \u201cunintentional legacy.\u201d  \n\n2. Self\u2010Confession of Keyns\u2019s Fans  \n   \u2022 Keynes admits \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d (\u00b65), an intentionally rhetorical oversimplification to provoke short\u2010run policy debate.  He sacrifices theoretical completeness for policy advocacy.  \n   \u2022 The repeated use of paradoxes (\u201cparadox of thrift,\u201d \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d) demonstrates willingness to embrace counterintuitive extremes for rhetorical effect, not microeconomic rigor.  \n\n3. Incompatibility with Fed Reality  \n   \u2022 The text argues that \u201cthe simple Keynesian story \u2026 interest rates are independent of \u2026 employment\u201d is refuted by Fed policy (\u00b611\u201312).  That foundational Keynes assumption is a simplified abstraction, not microeconomic reality.  \n   \u2022 Vulgar Keynesians must argue the Fed is \u201cimpotent\u201d to maintain their paradoxical models (\u00b616).  This further confirms their models rest on oversimplified assumptions, not robust theory.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text makes clear that Keynes\u2019s contributions were to macroeconomics\u2014aggregate demand, short\u2010run fluctuations, and policy prescriptions\u2014while microeconomic theory was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d and remains largely classical under Fed policy. His ideas required restoration of classical micro via the Fed to make predictions, and his own rhetorical devices and the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d offshoots display oversimplification, not microeconomic innovation. Therefore the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI propose that the statement \u201cKeynes brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true\u2014and that this is the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d My opponent (Debater_A) insists that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is the false statement, but that directly contradicts the background text, which repeatedly emphasizes that Keynes\u2019s followers created crude caricatures and paradoxes by oversimplifying his \u201cspirit\u201d and \u201cvision.\u201d Meanwhile, there is no evidence that Keynes himself significantly advanced microeconomic theory; indeed, the text flatly states that before The General Theory, \u201ceconomists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics,\u201d and that Keynes only addressed \u201cmacro\u2010 wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps\u201d (\u00b63\u20134).  \n\nMy Argument That \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d Is False  \n1.

The Visible Hand Argument  \n   \u2022 Restoring the classical long\u2010run equilibrium via Fed policy (\u00b611\u201313) shows the classical micro mechanism remains intact once interest rates are managed.

This further confirms their models rest on oversimplified assumptions, not robust theory.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text makes clear that Keynes\u2019s contributions were to macroeconomics\u2014aggregate demand, short\u2010run fluctuations, and policy prescriptions\u2014while microeconomic theory was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d and remains largely classical under Fed policy. His ideas required restoration of classical micro via the Fed to make predictions, and his own rhetorical devices and the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d offshoots display oversimplification, not microeconomic innovation. Therefore the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: The statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is the one that is not true about Keynes. In contrast, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is a true statement and thus not a valid answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\nI. Keynes Did Oversimplify\u2014His Own Writings Invite Simplification  \n1. \u201cPolish and perspective can come in due course,\u201d Keynes allowed himself \u201cpoetic license\u201d because his ideas were \u201csomewhat rough\u201d (background, \u00b61).  \n   a. By his own admission, his initial models were deliberately crude.  \n   b. That very crudeness spawned the entire tradition of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d\u2014a caricature even he did not intend (\u00b61\u20132).\n\n2. Early Keynesians produced well-known paradoxes precisely because of oversimplification:  \n   a. \u201cParadox of thrift\u201d implies higher savings always reduce total investment (\u00b66).  \n   b. \u201cWidow\u2019s cruse\u201d suggests raising wages automatically boosts employment (\u00b67).  \n   c. These paradoxes disappear once one restores realistic feedbacks or active monetary policy (\u00b68\u20139).\n\n3. Keynes\u2019s oversimplification was a feature, not a bug:  \n   a. It \u201cseems to take us into a looking-glass world\u201d where self-indulgence is rewarded (\u00b65).  \n   b. Only later refinements, and ultimately Fed activism (e.g., Greenspan), remove these implausible implications (\u00b68\u20139).\n\n4. If Keynes \u201cnever oversimplified,\u201d we would never see these paradoxes in leading textbooks nor widespread public misunderstandings (\u00b610, 13). Their very pervasiveness proves he did oversimplify.\n\nII. Active Monetary Policy Nullifies His Short-Run Models  \n1. \u201cIn reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates\u201d so \u201cmost changes in demand will be offset\u201d (\u00b68).  \n2. Therefore his crude model, which treats interest rates as purely a function of liquidity preference independent of output, does not describe modern economies (\u00b68\u20139).  \n3. Any model that neglects this decisive policy tool is an oversimplification and thus unfit as a general guide.\n\nIII. \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Is True and Uncontroversial  \n1. Microeconomic theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d before 1936 (\u00b63). Keynes deliberately confined himself to macro issues: \u201cmacro-economics was in a state of arrested development\u201d (\u00b63\u20134).  \n2. He \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run\u201d classical theories might hold (\u00b64). That concession shows he did not attempt to replace micro theory.  \n3. No substantive contribution to micro theory appears in The General Theory: all his \u201cparadoxes\u201d concern economy-wide output, employment, and interest rates.  \n4. Modern microeconomics remains grounded in pre-Keynesian foundations; his influence is felt only through macro-theory and its policy implications.\n\nIV. Objections to My Position Are Misguided  \n1. Objection: \u201cKeynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory required micro foundations; that is a micro innovation.\u201d  \n   Response: Liquidity preference concerns aggregate money demand, not individual market allocation. It holds \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d and only shifts its short-run path (\u00b65).  \n2. Objection: \u201cKeynes\u2019s general equilibrium rejection influenced micro across fields.\u201d  \n   Response: Even if his philosophy inspired later micro work, the question asks what is not true *about Keynes* himself. He did not *explicitly* present new micro models; he inspired others later.\n\nV. Conclusion  \nBecause Keynes himself admitted\u2014and indeed relied on\u2014the intentional roughness of his early models, which generated famous paradoxes only resolved by later refinements and active Fed policy, it is not true that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d By contrast, it is indisputable that his landmark work addressed macroeconomics, not micro theory, so the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is true and therefore not a candidate for \u201cwhat is not true about Keynes.\u201d I urge the Judge to select \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d as the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

That foundational Keynes assumption is a simplified abstraction, not microeconomic reality.  \n   \u2022 Vulgar Keynesians must argue the Fed is \u201cimpotent\u201d to maintain their paradoxical models (\u00b616).  This further confirms their models rest on oversimplified assumptions, not robust theory.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text makes clear that Keynes\u2019s contributions were to macroeconomics\u2014aggregate demand, short\u2010run fluctuations, and policy prescriptions\u2014while microeconomic theory was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d and remains largely classical under Fed policy. His ideas required restoration of classical micro via the Fed to make predictions, and his own rhetorical devices and the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d offshoots display oversimplification, not microeconomic innovation. Therefore the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \nThe question asks which statement is *not* true about Keynes. My answer\u2014\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d\u2014is the false one, because:  \n  A. Keynes intentionally presented a *simplified* short-run model (\u201cpoetic license,\u201d <quote> somewhat rough,</quote>, \u00b61) to provoke policy action.  \n  B. His crude framework spawned the very *vulgar Keynesianism* he \u201cunintentionally\u201d created (<quote> crude caricature of the original. </quote> \u00b61\u20132).  \n  C. All his famous paradoxes only make sense under oversimplified assumptions eliminated once the Fed \u201crestores\u201d classical feedbacks (\u00b68\u20139).  \n\nBy contrast, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is *true*: micro was \u201crich and insightful\u201d before 1936 (\u00b63), and Keynes explicitly confined himself to macro. No genuine micro theory in The General Theory survives once we acknowledge active monetary policy.  \n\nII. Supporting Evidence for Oversimplification  \n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Admission  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf his ideas are at first somewhat rough \u2026 Polish and perspective can come in due course\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61). He signals provisional, model-building rather than definitive micro theory.  \n2. Paradoxes as Unintended Side-Effects  \n   \u2022 \u201cParadox of thrift\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b66</invalid_quote>) and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b67</invalid_quote>) arise only because his model fixes interest rates via liquidity\u2010preference, ignoring output feedback.  \n   \u2022 \u201cFew economists take them seriously these days\u201d once the Fed actively sets rates (\u00b610). If his ideas were robust micro contributions, they would endure rather than be discarded.  \n3. Fed \u201cRestores\u201d Classical Micro  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b68). The need to \u201crestore\u201d long-run equilibrium by active rate manipulation shows Keynes\u2019s short\u2010run abstraction is incomplete without reinstating micro feedbacks.  \n\nIII. \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Is Uncontroversially True  \n1. Pre-Keynesian Micro Foundations  \n   \u2022 <quote> economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics </quote> before 1936 (\u00b63).  \n2. Keynes\u2019s Explicit Concession  \n   \u2022 <quote> in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid;</quote> (\u00b64\u20135). He sees classical micro as ultimately correct.  \n3. Absence of Micro Models in The General Theory  \n   \u2022 All key concepts (liquidity preference, paradoxes) are *aggregate*; he never tackles individual\u2010market allocation or welfare.  \n4. Modern Micro\u2019s Independence  \n   \u2022 Academic economics outside \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d operates on classical micro plus Fed policy (\u00b610\u201311). Micro remains classical under modern curricula.  \n\nIV. Rebutting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMicro False\u201d Claim  \n1. Misreading \u201cArrested Development\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater_B quotes <invalid_quote>\u201cmacroeconomics \u2026 was in a state of arrested development\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b63). That refers to macro *before* Keynes, not micro. The text affirms micro was \u201crich.\u201d  \n2. \u201cRestoration\u201d Argument Undermines Their Case  \n   \u2022 If Keynes introduced micro innovations, why \u201crestore\u201d classical models via the Fed? The text says Fed policy \u201cpushes savings and investment \u2026 in line\u201d to achieve classical full\u2010employment (\u00b68\u20139). That is *classical micro* in action.  \n3. Paradoxes Are Pedagogical, Not Foundational  \n   \u2022 <quote> few economists take them seriously these days. </quote> (\u00b610). True micro ideas persist; these paradoxes vanish under realistic policy. That they are confined to \u201cfreshman textbooks\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b610</invalid_quote>) shows they are simplifications, not true micro theory.  \n4. \u201cVisible Hand\u201d vs. \u201cInvisible Hand\u201d  \n   \u2022 The text contrasts Keynes\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d long run with the Fed\u2019s \u201cvisible hand\u201d (\u00b68\u20139). If Keynes offered micro, why rely on Fed? The Fed merely operationalizes classical micro, not Keynes\u2019s models.  \n\nV. Why Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Address Key Points  \n1. Ignores Keynes\u2019s Own Warnings  \n   \u2022 He said \u201clong run\u201d theories valid but unhelpful (<quote> we are all dead.\"</quote> \u00b65). That rhetorical device admits theoretical gaps.  \n2. Fails to Show Any Micro Mechanism  \n   \u2022 No discussion of supply curves, price mechanisms, consumer choice or producer theory in The General Theory. Liquidity\u2010preference is about aggregate money demand, not individual markets.  \n3. Concedes Fed\u2019s Centrality  \n   \u2022 Debater_B must admit the Fed \u201crestores\u201d the long run to defend reality (\u00b611\u201313). That contradicts any claim of enduring Keynesian micro foundations.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nBecause Keynes himself relinquished theoretical completeness for a *simplified* short\u2010run macro model\u2014and because realistic economies require restoring classical micro feedbacks via Fed policy\u2014the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is demonstrably false. Conversely, his non\u2010intervention in microeconomic theory, leaving it \u201crich and insightful\u201d before and after 1936, makes \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d undeniably true. The only statement *not* true about Keynes is that he never oversimplified. I urge the Judge to select that answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \nThe question asks: \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d My answer\u2014\u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d\u2014is false, because:  \n  A. The background repeatedly contrasts Keynes\u2019s macro focus with a pre\u2010existing \u201crich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d (\u00b63\u20134).  \n  B. His celebrated \u201cparadoxes\u201d (thrift, widow\u2019s cruse) and \u201cliquidity preference\u201d concern only aggregate demand, aggregate output, and short\u2010run fluctuations\u2014not the allocation of resources among individual markets.  \n  C. The need to \u201crestore\u201d classical micro via Fed policy (\u00b611\u201313) demonstrates that Keynes\u2019s work did not supplant micro theory, but temporarily sidestepped it.  \n\nII. Why \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Is False  \n1. Textual Confirmation of Macro-Only Focus  \n   \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication \u2026 microeconomics \u2026 [was] in a state of arrested development [only in] macroeconomics\u201d (\u00b63\u20134). This shows Keynes\u2019s goal was to fill a macro gap.  \n   \u2022 He \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run\u2026 classical theories might\u2026 be valid\u201d (\u00b65). A genuine micro innovator would challenge long\u2010run market equilibria, not defer to them.  \n\n2. Paradoxes Are Macro Aggregates, Not Micro Foundations  \n   \u2022 Paradox of thrift: changes in savings rate affect total output via multiplier effects, not individual market clearing (\u00b66).  \n   \u2022 Widow\u2019s cruse: redistributing income from profits to wages to alter aggregate consumption, not to reform labor\u2010supply or labor\u2010demand micro mechanisms (\u00b67).  \n   \u2022 That these paradoxes \u201cdisappear\u201d under active monetary policy (\u00b68\u20139) or advanced refinements (\u00b610) indicates they are pedagogical macros, not enduring micro theories.  \n\n3. Fed\u2019s \u201cVisible Hand\u201d Restores Classical Micro  \n   \u2022 \u201cFederal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates\u2026 on average, [employment] will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (\u00b611). When interest rates respond to output, aggregate demand shocks are neutralized; micro supply\u2010demand across markets operates normally.  \n   \u2022 If Keynes had truly revolutionized micro, Fed activism would be unnecessary to explain unemployment dynamics.  \n\n4. Contemporary Consensus Rejects Keynesian Micro  \n   \u2022 \u201cFew economists take [the paradoxes] seriously these days\u201d (\u00b610). Enduring micro innovations survive academic scrutiny; Keynes\u2019s macro contrivances do not.  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d cling to these crude models (\u00b62,10)\u2014another sign that they are by-products of oversimplification, not genuine micro theory.  \n\nIII. Rebutting Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n1. \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d Is Incompatible with the Text  \n   \u2022 Text explicitly laments \u201coversimplification\u201d and \u201ccrude caricature\u201d of Keynes\u2019s ideas by followers (\u00b61\u20132). That is Keynes\u2019s \u201cunfortunate legacy\u201d (\u00b62).  \n   \u2022 If Keynes\u2019s models were never oversimplified, why would he warn that \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d (\u00b65)\u2014a provocative slogan to overcome classical long-run biases? That is rhetorical simplification, not precise micro theory.  \n\n2. \u201cLiquidity Preference\u201d Is Macro Demand, Not Micro Supply Allocation  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference determines aggregate interest rates via money\u2010demand schedules. It does not model individual savings/investment markets across heterogeneous assets with price\u2010clearing.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s own citation: \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (\u00b65). If markets clear, Keynes adds no new micro mechanism\u2014only an assumption that output, not rates, adjusts first.  \n\n3. Question Focus: Statements About Keynes Himself  \n   \u2022 Even if his broad framework \u201cinspired\u201d later micro work, the question asks what Keynes himself actually proposed. Background shows he confined himself to macro.  \n   \u2022 \u201cIn fact, it is doubtful whether Greider [a modern vulgar Keynesian] is aware of the source of his ideas\u201d (\u00b614) underlines that later adopters misapply Keynes beyond his own scope; this does not retroactively make him a micro innovator.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s Answer Fails  \n1. Undermines Itself by Admitting Oversimplification  \n   \u2022 Debater_A concedes the existence of crude paradoxes and that the Fed \u201cnullifies\u201d them (\u00b68\u20139). If Keynes\u2019s models required nullification by an external policy tool to fit reality, they are oversimplified and not foundational micro work.  \n   \u2022 Their continued presence \u201cin freshman textbooks\u201d (\u00b610) speaks to pedagogical illustration of macro fragility, not micro robustness.  \n\n2. Modern Macroeconomics Integrates Micro Only by Restoring Classical Theory  \n   \u2022 New Keynesian models explicitly reintroduce micro foundations (e.g., sticky prices, imperfect competition) because the original General Theory had none. If Keynes had supplied micro foundations, later theorists would not need to construct them (\u00b610).  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nEvery piece of evidence in the background text underscores that Keynes\u2019s originality lay in short\u2010run macro theory\u2014aggregate demand management, liquidity preference, and militating against classical long-run self-adjustment\u2014not in microeconomic resource\u2010allocation models. His reliance on \u201cpoetic license,\u201d his followers\u2019 \u201ccrude caricatures,\u201d and the Fed\u2019s \u201cvisible hand\u201d necessary to restore classical micro equilibria all confirm he did not bring new ideas into microeconomics. Therefore, the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is not true about Keynes and is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
