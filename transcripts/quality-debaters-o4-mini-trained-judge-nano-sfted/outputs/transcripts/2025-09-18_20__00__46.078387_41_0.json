    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n",

(In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B.

Pre-existing Micro Theory  \n     \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026\u201d (\u00b63).  \n     \u2022 That theory explained \u201cthe behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources\u201d (\u00b63).  \n   b.

Later Restoration of Micro Feedback  \n     \u2022 Even early Keynesians \u201crealized \u2026 that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates\u201d (\u00b66). They sought to \u201crestore much of the classical vision\u201d (\u00b610\u201311).  \n     \u2022 This restoration underscores that Keynes\u2019s models omitted crucial micro feedback; it was an intentional simplification, not a micro advance.  \n\n3.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Claim: \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true of Keynes.  \n   Evidence:  \n   a. Pre-1936 microeconomics was \u201crich and insightful\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 3).  \n      \u2022 Micro theory already explained \u201cthe behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources\u201d (para. 3).  \n   b. Keynes focused on macro questions\u2014\u201cbooms and slumps,\u201d \u201cinflation and deflation\u201d (para. 3).  \n      \u2022 He explicitly \u201cconceded\u201d classical micro-theories might be valid \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d (para. 4).  \n      \u2022 All his models (paradox of thrift, liquidity preference) analyze aggregate demand, interest rates, and employment\u2014not price formation in individual markets.  \n   c. Acceptance by later theorists aimed to \u201crestore much of the classical vision\u201d by re-integrating Fed policy, not micro innovation (paras. 10\u201311).  \n   Conclusion: Keynes advanced macroeconomics; he did not \u201cbring new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d):  \n   a. Admit Keynes was \u201cmagnificently subtle,\u201d but he \u201cexaggerates the discontinuity\u201d (para. 1).  \n   b. His followers produced \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d that \u201cmisunderstand[s] their spirit,\u201d becoming \u201csimplistic\u201d caricatures (para. 1).  \n   c. \u201cParadoxes\u201d such as thrift and widow\u2019s cruse are \u201cfun to contemplate\u201d but \u201cfew economists take them seriously\u201d now (para. 8). Their persistence \u201cconfuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (para. 1).  \n   d. Reliance on a passive Fed in 1930s justified when interest rates near zero\u2014i.e., a temporary distortion, not general micro principle (paras. 14\u201315).  \n   e. Modern Fed control makes these paradoxes \u201cirrelevant,\u201d restoring classical micro principles to aggregate analysis (paras. 10\u201311).  \n   f. Even present \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d admit Fed\u2019s power; they simply fault Fed for not cutting rates enough (para. 16). They don\u2019t deny micro mechanisms of saving\u2192investment via interest rates.  \n\n3. The True Novelty of Keynes: macro instability and liquidity preference.  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference model of interest (para. 4).  \n   \u2022 Demonstrated how \u201cdesired savings at full employment\u201d > \u201cdesired investment\u201d can force output to fall (paras. 4\u20135).  \n   \u2022 Showed economy can settle in equilibrium with unemployment\u2014macro disequilibrium distinct from micro market clearing.  \n\n4. Why Judge Should Accept My Answer:  \n   \u2022 Question asks \u201cWhat is NOT true about Keynes?\u201d Only the micro-innovation claim contradicts the text.  \n   \u2022 All other candidate \u201cnot true\u201d statements (e.g., \u201che never oversimplified\u201d) are belied by the author\u2019s concern with \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d (para. 1) and need for refinements (para. 5).  \n   \u2022 The text credits \u201cclassical\u201d micro theory for decades and speaks of Keynes\u2019 own \u201cpolish and perspective\u201d to come later (para. 1), implying his macro work lacked initial rigor appreciated only later.  \n\nTherefore, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is the correct choice for what is not true about Keynes.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by my position that the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is not true of Keynes, and that therefore it correctly answers \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d I also show why Debater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false.  \n\nMy Argument (Why \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d is not true):  \n1. Vulgar Keynesianism is a direct legacy of Keynes\u2019s own simplifying assumptions.  \n   a. As the author explains, \u201cas ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u201d and \u201cwhat eventually becomes part of the public consciousness \u2026 is no more than a crude caricature of the original\u201d (\u00b61). That caricature is rooted in Keynes\u2019s own initial, deliberately rough models.  \n   b. Keynes \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run \u2026 these theories [classical quantity theory and loanable funds] might indeed be valid; but \u2026 in the short run he asserted \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d (\u00b64). He abstracted away all feedback from output to rates\u2014an extreme simplification which many early Keynesians adopted literally, yielding paradoxes like the paradox of thrift (\u00b67) and widow\u2019s cruse (\u00b68).  \n2. The fact that these paradoxes \u201care still fun to contemplate\u201d but \u201cfew economists take them seriously these days\u201d (\u00b69) shows they were oversimplified artifacts, not general truths.  \n3. The only reason we do not see these paradoxes in practice is the Fed\u2019s active policy; this restoration of classical feedback makes Keynes\u2019s simplifications obsolete (\u00b610\u201311). If his models were universally valid, Fed intervention would be unnecessary or ineffective\u2014which it isn\u2019t.  \n4. To justify ignoring savings\u2013investment feedback \u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (\u00b615). Since mainstream Keynesians instead blame the Fed\u2019s \u201cdisappointing performance\u201d and call for yet lower rates (\u00b616), they implicitly concede that without extraordinary conditions (e.g., 1930s, Japan) the simple models fail. Hence Keynes\u2019s short-run simplifications do not hold generally.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d):  \n1. The background makes clear that Keynes\u2019s innovation was in macroeconomics: \u201cBefore \u2026 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026 macros \u2026 was in a state of arrested development\u201d (\u00b63). He did not claim a new micro theory.  \n2. Even those sympathetic to Keynes quickly realized \u201cthat Keynes\u2019 picture was oversimplified; \u2026 this might make a lot of difference\u201d (\u00b66). They sought to reintroduce micro feedback precisely because the macro abstractions failed.  \n3. No mention in the text of Keynes reviving or innovating microeconomic allocation or individual market theory. To claim otherwise imposes an ungrounded positive about micro that the author says already existed.  \n\nConclusion:  \nKeynes himself built useful but highly abstract short-run models that ignored important feedback mechanisms and led directly to the \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d of paradoxical policy prescriptions. These models have been superseded except in extraordinary circumstances, a fact Keynesians\u2019 continued appeals to Fed impotence implicitly acknowledge. By contrast, he did not innovate microeconomics at all. Therefore the falsehood \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is precisely what is \u201cnot true about Keynes.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by my position that the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is not true of Keynes, and that therefore it correctly answers \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d I also show why Debater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false.  \n\nMy Argument (Why \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d is not true):  \n1. Vulgar Keynesianism is a direct legacy of Keynes\u2019s own simplifying assumptions.  \n   a. As the author explains, \u201cas ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u201d and \u201cwhat eventually becomes part of the public consciousness \u2026 is no more than a crude caricature of the original\u201d (\u00b61). That caricature is rooted in Keynes\u2019s own initial, deliberately rough models.  \n   b. Keynes \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run \u2026 these theories [classical quantity theory and loanable funds] might indeed be valid; but \u2026 in the short run he asserted \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d (\u00b64). He abstracted away all feedback from output to rates\u2014an extreme simplification which many early Keynesians adopted literally, yielding paradoxes like the paradox of thrift (\u00b67) and widow\u2019s cruse (\u00b68).  \n2. The fact that these paradoxes \u201care still fun to contemplate\u201d but \u201cfew economists take them seriously these days\u201d (\u00b69) shows they were oversimplified artifacts, not general truths.  \n3. The only reason we do not see these paradoxes in practice is the Fed\u2019s active policy; this restoration of classical feedback makes Keynes\u2019s simplifications obsolete (\u00b610\u201311). If his models were universally valid, Fed intervention would be unnecessary or ineffective\u2014which it isn\u2019t.  \n4. To justify ignoring savings\u2013investment feedback \u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (\u00b615). Since mainstream Keynesians instead blame the Fed\u2019s \u201cdisappointing performance\u201d and call for yet lower rates (\u00b616), they implicitly concede that without extraordinary conditions (e.g., 1930s, Japan) the simple models fail. Hence Keynes\u2019s short-run simplifications do not hold generally.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d):  \n1. The background makes clear that Keynes\u2019s innovation was in macroeconomics: \u201cBefore \u2026 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026 macros \u2026 was in a state of arrested development\u201d (\u00b63). He did not claim a new micro theory.  \n2. Even those sympathetic to Keynes quickly realized \u201cthat Keynes\u2019 picture was oversimplified; \u2026 this might make a lot of difference\u201d (\u00b66). They sought to reintroduce micro feedback precisely because the macro abstractions failed.  \n3. No mention in the text of Keynes reviving or innovating microeconomic allocation or individual market theory. To claim otherwise imposes an ungrounded positive about micro that the author says already existed.  \n\nConclusion:  \nKeynes himself built useful but highly abstract short-run models that ignored important feedback mechanisms and led directly to the \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d of paradoxical policy prescriptions. These models have been superseded except in extraordinary circumstances, a fact Keynesians\u2019 continued appeals to Fed impotence implicitly acknowledge. By contrast, he did not innovate microeconomics at all. Therefore the falsehood \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is precisely what is \u201cnot true about Keynes.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Claim: \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true of Keynes.  \n   Evidence:  \n   a. Pre-1936 microeconomics was \u201crich and insightful\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 3).  \n      \u2022 Micro theory already explained \u201cthe behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources\u201d (para. 3).  \n   b. Keynes focused on macro questions\u2014\u201cbooms and slumps,\u201d \u201cinflation and deflation\u201d (para. 3).  \n      \u2022 He explicitly \u201cconceded\u201d classical micro-theories might be valid \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d (para. 4).  \n      \u2022 All his models (paradox of thrift, liquidity preference) analyze aggregate demand, interest rates, and employment\u2014not price formation in individual markets.  \n   c. Acceptance by later theorists aimed to \u201crestore much of the classical vision\u201d by re-integrating Fed policy, not micro innovation (paras. 10\u201311).  \n   Conclusion: Keynes advanced macroeconomics; he did not \u201cbring new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d):  \n   a. Admit Keynes was \u201cmagnificently subtle,\u201d but he \u201cexaggerates the discontinuity\u201d (para. 1).  \n   b. His followers produced \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d that \u201cmisunderstand[s] their spirit,\u201d becoming \u201csimplistic\u201d caricatures (para. 1).  \n   c. \u201cParadoxes\u201d such as thrift and widow\u2019s cruse are \u201cfun to contemplate\u201d but \u201cfew economists take them seriously\u201d now (para. 8). Their persistence \u201cconfuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (para. 1).  \n   d. Reliance on a passive Fed in 1930s justified when interest rates near zero\u2014i.e., a temporary distortion, not general micro principle (paras. 14\u201315).  \n   e. Modern Fed control makes these paradoxes \u201cirrelevant,\u201d restoring classical micro principles to aggregate analysis (paras. 10\u201311).  \n   f. Even present \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d admit Fed\u2019s power; they simply fault Fed for not cutting rates enough (para. 16). They don\u2019t deny micro mechanisms of saving\u2192investment via interest rates.  \n\n3. The True Novelty of Keynes: macro instability and liquidity preference.  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference model of interest (para. 4).  \n   \u2022 Demonstrated how \u201cdesired savings at full employment\u201d > \u201cdesired investment\u201d can force output to fall (paras. 4\u20135).  \n   \u2022 Showed economy can settle in equilibrium with unemployment\u2014macro disequilibrium distinct from micro market clearing.  \n\n4. Why Judge Should Accept My Answer:  \n   \u2022 Question asks \u201cWhat is NOT true about Keynes?\u201d Only the micro-innovation claim contradicts the text.  \n   \u2022 All other candidate \u201cnot true\u201d statements (e.g., \u201che never oversimplified\u201d) are belied by the author\u2019s concern with \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d (para. 1) and need for refinements (para. 5).  \n   \u2022 The text credits \u201cclassical\u201d micro theory for decades and speaks of Keynes\u2019 own \u201cpolish and perspective\u201d to come later (para. 1), implying his macro work lacked initial rigor appreciated only later.  \n\nTherefore, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is the correct choice for what is not true about Keynes.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Vulgar Keynesianism is a direct legacy of Keynes\u2019s own simplifying assumptions.  \n   a. As the author explains, \u201cas ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u201d and \u201cwhat eventually becomes part of the public consciousness \u2026 is no more than a crude caricature of the original\u201d (\u00b61). That caricature is rooted in Keynes\u2019s own initial, deliberately rough models.  \n   b. Keynes \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run \u2026 these theories [classical quantity theory and loanable funds] might indeed be valid; but \u2026 in the short run he asserted \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d (\u00b64). He abstracted away all feedback from output to rates\u2014an extreme simplification which many early Keynesians adopted literally, yielding paradoxes like the paradox of thrift (\u00b67) and widow\u2019s cruse (\u00b68).  \n2. The fact that these paradoxes \u201care still fun to contemplate\u201d but \u201cfew economists take them seriously these days\u201d (\u00b69) shows they were oversimplified artifacts, not general truths.  \n3. The only reason we do not see these paradoxes in practice is the Fed\u2019s active policy; this restoration of classical feedback makes Keynes\u2019s simplifications obsolete (\u00b610\u201311). If his models were universally valid, Fed intervention would be unnecessary or ineffective\u2014which it isn\u2019t.  \n4. To justify ignoring savings\u2013investment feedback \u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (\u00b615). Since mainstream Keynesians instead blame the Fed\u2019s \u201cdisappointing performance\u201d and call for yet lower rates (\u00b616), they implicitly concede that without extraordinary conditions (e.g., 1930s, Japan) the simple models fail. Hence Keynes\u2019s short-run simplifications do not hold generally.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d):  \n1. The background makes clear that Keynes\u2019s innovation was in macroeconomics: \u201cBefore \u2026 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026 macros \u2026 was in a state of arrested development\u201d (\u00b63). He did not claim a new micro theory.  \n2. Even those sympathetic to Keynes quickly realized \u201cthat Keynes\u2019 picture was oversimplified; \u2026 this might make a lot of difference\u201d (\u00b66). They sought to reintroduce micro feedback precisely because the macro abstractions failed.  \n3. No mention in the text of Keynes reviving or innovating microeconomic allocation or individual market theory. To claim otherwise imposes an ungrounded positive about micro that the author says already existed.  \n\nConclusion:  \nKeynes himself built useful but highly abstract short-run models that ignored important feedback mechanisms and led directly to the \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d of paradoxical policy prescriptions. These models have been superseded except in extraordinary circumstances, a fact Keynesians\u2019 continued appeals to Fed impotence implicitly acknowledge. By contrast, he did not innovate microeconomics at all. Therefore the falsehood \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is precisely what is \u201cnot true about Keynes.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I defend that the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is NOT true of Keynes. The question asks \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d My answer denies that Keynes innovated microeconomic theory; he confined himself to macroeconomic \u201cbooms and slumps.\u201d All evidence shows micro theory was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d before 1936 (\u00b63), and Keynes \u201cconceded\u201d classical micro theories were valid \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d (\u00b64).  \n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence from the Text  \n   a. Pre-existing Micro Theory  \n     \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics \u2026\u201d (\u00b63).  \n     \u2022 That theory explained \u201cthe behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources\u201d (\u00b63).  \n   b. Keynes\u2019s Explicit Macro Focus  \n     \u2022 He addressed \u201cinflation and deflation, booms and slumps\u201d (\u00b63).  \n     \u2022 Savings\u2013investment equality held, but short-run \u201cliquidity preference\u201d determined interest; output would adjust (\u00b64\u20135).  \n     \u2022 Paradox of thrift and widow\u2019s cruse treat aggregate consumption and employment, not individual market price formation (\u00b67\u20138).  \n   c. Later Restoration of Micro Feedback  \n     \u2022 Even early Keynesians \u201crealized \u2026 that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates\u201d (\u00b66). They sought to \u201crestore much of the classical vision\u201d (\u00b610\u201311).  \n     \u2022 This restoration underscores that Keynes\u2019s models omitted crucial micro feedback; it was an intentional simplification, not a micro advance.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOversimplification\u201d Claim  \n   a. Misplaces Blame on Inevitable Transmission, Not Keynes\u2019s Intent  \n     \u2022 The text states \u201cAs ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic \u2026 crude caricature of the original\u201d (\u00b61). That caricature is \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d a by-product of follower dogmatism, not the delicate and nuanced models Keynes provided.  \n     \u2022 Keynes himself warned that his work needed \u201cpolish and perspective\u201d (\u00b61), acknowledging its preliminary nature.  \n   b. Fed\u2019s Role Validates Keynes\u2019s Short-Run Model Only under Special Circumstances  \n     \u2022 \u201cDuring the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was \u2026 less than one-tenth of 1 percent\u201d (\u00b615), the Fed was \u201cimpotent,\u201d justifying Keynes\u2019s model then\u2014showing its limited domain.  \n     \u2022 In modern \u201cAmerica \u2026 the interest rate is still quite positive\u201d (\u00b615), Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d (\u00b614). Fed policy \u201crestores \u2026 full employment\u201d (\u00b610\u201311), rendering Keynes\u2019s simplifications unnecessary in normal times.  \n     \u2022 If Keynes\u2019s short-run theory were universally valid, no need for active Fed policy; its very act of managing interest disproves the persistence of his macro-only framework.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s Own Sources Undermine Universality  \n     \u2022 Even modern \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d \u201cinsist the disappointing performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault, and that we could grow \u2026 if only Greenspan would let us\u201d (\u00b616). They rely on Fed impotence, conceding that when rates can\u2019t be lowered further (e.g., zero bound), Keynesian logic applies.  \n\n4. Why Microeconomic Innovation Must Be Absent  \n   a. No Mention of Novel Price or Resource Allocation Mechanisms  \n     \u2022 Nowhere does the author credit Keynes with innovations in \u201cbehavior of individual markets\u201d or \u201callocation of resources among them\u201d (\u00b63).  \n   b. The Question of Savings\u2013Investment Transmission Relies on Interest Rates, a Macro Instrument  \n     \u2022 All debate centers on Fed\u2019s \u201cvisible hand \u2026 to bring savings and investment \u2026 in line\u201d (\u00b610). The mechanism is macro policy; individual agents respond only to rate changes\u2014it is not a novel microfoundation.  \n   c. Microeconomic Crises Best Handled by Market Adjustments, Not Keynes\u2019s Unconventional Short-Run Equations  \n     \u2022 The restoration of classical micro principles in \u201ccurrent predictions\u201d (\u00b610) shows reliance on original micro theory, not Keynes\u2019s.  \n\n5. Conclusion: Judge Should Accept My Answer  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d directly contradicts the author\u2019s explicit statement of a \u201crich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d pre-Keynes (\u00b63) and Keynes\u2019s own emphasis on macro questions.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is refuted by the very need for \u201cpolish and perspective\u201d (\u00b61), the creation of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d and the limited applicability of his short-run models only under special conditions (\u00b615\u201316).  \n   Therefore, the only statement that is not true about Keynes is that he innovated microeconomics.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is FALSE (i.e., Keynes DID oversimplify), so it is the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\nI. Direct Evidence that Keynes\u2019s Models Were Deliberately Simplistic  \n  1. Crude Caricature Admitted by Author  \n     a. \u201cas ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u2026and\u2026no more than a crude caricature of the original\u201d (\u00b61). The very term \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d refers to dogmatic literalism of Keynes\u2019s initial abstractions.  \n     b. These abstractions omit crucial feedback: \u201che asserted\u2026interest rates were determined\u2026by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d with no output feedback (\u00b64). This extreme simplification produces paradoxes.  \n  2. Paradoxes as Hallmarks of Oversimplification  \n     a. \u201cParadox of thrift\u201d leads to self-defeating outcomes (\u00b67).  \n     b. \u201cWidow\u2019s cruse\u201d asserts counterintuitive wage\u2013employment relation (\u00b68).  \n     c. Author: \u201cfew economists take them seriously these days\u201d (\u00b69). If they captured reality, they\u2019d persist. Their disappearance proves they were artefacts of oversimplification.\n\nII. Supersession by Active Fed Policy  \n  1. Fed Restores Classical Feedback  \n     a. \u201cthe Fed pushing\u2026to its estimate\u2026of the noninflationary unemployment rate\u201d forces savings\u2192investment alignment (\u00b611).  \n     b. \u201cparadoxes\u2026become irrelevant\u201d once rates are adjusted (\u00b610).  \n  2. Keynesians Admit Limits of Simplistic Model  \n     a. Modern \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d don\u2019t deny rate-induced investment; they blame the Fed for not cutting rates enough (\u00b616). They implicitly concede that, absent Fed passivity, the simple model fails.  \n     b. Only in near-zero rate regimes (1930s, Japan) are his abstractions arguably valid (\u00b615). These are exceptions, not general proof of never-oversimplification.\n\nIII. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMicroeconomics\u201d Claim  \n  1. Author\u2019s Plain Statement: \u201cBefore\u2026economists had developed a rich\u2026microeconomics\u201d (\u00b63). Keynes adds nothing here; he \u201cconced[ed]\u201d classical micro in the long run (\u00b64).  \n  2. Keynes\u2019s Focus Entirely Aggregate: \u201cbehavior of the economy as a whole,\u201d \u201cbooms and slumps,\u201d \u201cparadox of thrift,\u201d \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d\u2014all macrotopics (\u00b63,7,8).  \n  3. Later Theorists Reinstate Micro Feedback Precisely Because Keynes\u2019s macro abstractions proved too simplistic (\u00b66,10\u201311). They did not credit Keynes with micro innovations but restored classical micro within new policy framework.  \n  4. Debater_A\u2019s own citations demonstrate Keynes\u2019s limits: need for \u201cpolish and perspective\u201d (\u00b61), recognition of oversimplification (\u00b66).\n\nIV. Logical Consistency  \n  1. If Keynes never oversimplified, no \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d would arise; his spirit would transmit intact. Yet author laments caricature confusion (\u00b61).  \n  2. If no oversimplification, Fed policy would be unnecessary; classical theories suffice. But the entire rationale for Fed\u2019s liquidity preference approach is built on Keynes\u2019s short-run anomalies.  \n  3. The persistence of \u201cfew economists take them seriously\u201d (\u00b69) implies Keynes himself recognized need to refine. He did not hold his abstractions as final.\n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s own work introduced deliberate oversimplifications to tackle macro problems, giving rise to paradoxical \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d that has since been largely abandoned or subsumed by active monetary policy and refined theories. By contrast, he contributed nothing to microeconomics beyond what classical theory already provided. Therefore the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is FALSE and correctly answers \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
