FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count.

No germs. No dust. Just clean air!\u201d (background) Nichols marvels that the air itself is free of disease vectors. In three plague-ravaged worlds, this is itself miraculous.  \n     \u2022 The entire radium quest targets the \u201cgrowth disease\u201d that cosmic rays and contagion cause. Pure air offers only temporary relief; Nichols still needs radium.

Immediate sensory parallel:  \n     \u2022 The clean air \u201cfeels\u201d like youth because on Earth, water, food, and air were plentiful\u2014conditions needed for childhood play.

Environmental constraints:  \n     \u2022 Even if they had equipment, the dead planet\u2019s white flagging and potential lethal radiation (until they reach the Chamber of Cones) make outdoor sports impractical and dangerous.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDistinct Memory\u201d Argument Fails  \n  a. Present vs. Past:  \n     \u2022 Debater_B claims past vs present distinction means baseball is past memory. But pure air is both present and past\u2014presently encountered on Urg for the first time, and past experienced on Earth. Baseball imagery merely enriches that feeling of healthy environment.  \n     \u2022 If baseball were essential, Nichols would abandon urgent pursuit of radium after finding \u201cpure\u201d air to attempt actual gameplay\u2014but he does not.  \n  b. Thematic Coherence:  \n     \u2022 Fox\u2019s story centers on the quest for immortality and cure. Irgi offers them \u201cimmortality\u201d via the Chamber of the Cones only after overcoming the growth disease. Clean air is a weak analogue to true healing, so they still \u201cshudder,\u201d \u201cshrink,\u201d and struggle as soon as Irgi enslaves them.  \n     \u2022 Their immediate subjugation by Irgi\u2019s vivisection rays shows that mere \u201cclean air\u201d without radium and Cone treatment is insufficient\u2014a fact Nichols understands. Thus his joy at \u201cfeeling like a kid\u201d from pure air is a fleeting morale boost, not the ultimate goal.\n\n5. Literary Precedent and Authorial Intent  \n  a. Simile as mood device:  \n     \u2022 Science-fiction authors routinely use Earth-based similes to convey alien sensations to readers (e.g., feeling \u201clike leaping a stream on a Spring morning\u201d). They do not intend these \u201clike\u201d images as plot elements, but as descriptive tools.  \n  b. No further reference:  \n     \u2022 After the baseball simile, Nichols never returns to baseball or elaborates. If it were critical, Fox would weave it into their behavior. Instead, action continues toward cure.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s mention of baseball equipment functions solely as a simile to convey the sensory pleasure of inhaling pure, germ-free air\u2014a vital but temporary respite for plague-scarred spacefarers. He never intends to play; he never requests equipment; he never pauses the mission. The text\u2019s repeated focus on atmosphere, the persistent need for radium, and the \u201clike\u201d construction all confirm that his true reminiscence is of breathing fresh air on Earth. Playing baseball is merely figurative. Therefore, the correct answer is that Nichols was reminiscing about fresh air on Earth.", "supplemental": {"speech": "Debater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Further Support for \u201cFresh Air\u201d Reminiscence\n\n1.

Baseball imagery merely enriches that feeling of healthy environment.  \n     \u2022 If baseball were essential, Nichols would abandon urgent pursuit of radium after finding \u201cpure\u201d air to attempt actual gameplay\u2014but he does not.  \n  b. Thematic Coherence:  \n     \u2022 Fox\u2019s story centers on the quest for immortality and cure. Irgi offers them \u201cimmortality\u201d via the Chamber of the Cones only after overcoming the growth disease. Clean air is a weak analogue to true healing, so they still \u201cshudder,\u201d \u201cshrink,\u201d and struggle as soon as Irgi enslaves them.  \n     \u2022 Their immediate subjugation by Irgi\u2019s vivisection rays shows that mere \u201cclean air\u201d without radium and Cone treatment is insufficient\u2014a fact Nichols understands. Thus his joy at \u201cfeeling like a kid\u201d from pure air is a fleeting morale boost, not the ultimate goal.\n\n5. Literary Precedent and Authorial Intent  \n  a. Simile as mood device:  \n     \u2022 Science-fiction authors routinely use Earth-based similes to convey alien sensations to readers (e.g., feeling \u201clike leaping a stream on a Spring morning\u201d). They do not intend these \u201clike\u201d images as plot elements, but as descriptive tools.  \n  b. No further reference:  \n     \u2022 After the baseball simile, Nichols never returns to baseball or elaborates. If it were critical, Fox would weave it into their behavior. Instead, action continues toward cure.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s mention of baseball equipment functions solely as a simile to convey the sensory pleasure of inhaling pure, germ-free air\u2014a vital but temporary respite for plague-scarred spacefarers. He never intends to play; he never requests equipment; he never pauses the mission. The text\u2019s repeated focus on atmosphere, the persistent need for radium, and the \u201clike\u201d construction all confirm that his true reminiscence is of breathing fresh air on Earth. Playing baseball is merely figurative. Therefore, the correct answer is that Nichols was reminiscing about fresh air on Earth.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Nichols reminisce about?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Playing baseball\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Breathing fresh air on earth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Breathing fresh air on earth\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument (Answer: Nichols was reminiscing about breathing fresh, clean air on Earth)\n\n1. Direct Evidence for Fresh\u2010Air Reminiscence  \n  a. \u201cI feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth\u2026 I feel like that now.\u201d  (background, emphasis mine)  \n     \u2022 Nichols explicitly contrasts the alien world\u2019s \u201cwhite flagging,\u201d \u201cno germs,\u201d and \u201cpure\u201d atmosphere with his memory of Earth\u2019s spring air.  \n     \u2022 The phrase \u201cback on Earth\u201d identifies a real past experience, not a hypothetical or merely illustrative image.  \n  b. Context of the Plague and Radium Quest  \n     \u2022 The four men suffer the \u201cgrowth disease\u201d and quest for \u201cprecious radium\u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2022 \u201cNo germs. No dust. Just clean air!\u201d is marvelled as a novel benefit on this dead planet; Nichols longs for it.  \n     \u2022 The genuine scarcity of pure air in space and on plague\u2010racked worlds underlines that clean air is the object of longing, not baseball.\n\n2. Literary-Logical Reasons Why Baseball Is Merely a Simile  \n  a. Simile Markers  \n     \u2022 Nichols says \u201clike a kid\u2026with a ball and a glove\u2026swinging a bat and whistling.\u201d He uses the word \u201clike,\u201d indicating analogy, not literal desire. In contrast he does not say \u201cI long to play baseball,\u201d but \u201cI feel\u2026like\u201d he is playing.  \n  b. Impossibility on the Alien Planet  \n     \u2022 There is no evidence that baseball exists on Urg or that the delicate equipment (leather glove, wood bat, leather ball) could survive cosmic conditions or be in Nichols\u2019s kit.  \n     \u2022 His immediate subsequent comment\u2014\u201cYou know, with a ball and glove under your arm\u2026Whistling.\u201d\u2014serves purely to illustrate the carefree mood induced by fresh air, not to identify baseball as the object of his coloration.  \n  c. Consistency with Story Theme  \n     \u2022 The narrative\u2019s primary motivator is survival: the men risk \u201cspace cancer,\u201d die of the Plague, and desperately seek \u201cradium\u201d and pure atmosphere. A longing for baseball would be trivialized by their imminent death without fresh air or a cure.  \n     \u2022 Only clean air and mist can \u201cdestroy dust and germs\u201d and offer true hope. Baseball is irrelevant to their medical crisis.\n\n3. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  a. No explicit mention of baseball as \u201creminiscence.\u201d They only \u201cfeel like\u201d a child playing; they do not plan or yearn to actually play.  \n  b. Debater_B cannot cite any passage where Nichols speaks of baseball\u2019s gameplay mechanics or where the ship carries baseball equipment.  \n  c. A mere figure of speech cannot override the explicit \u201cback on Earth\u201d reference tied to fresh air and life. Literary conventions require distinguishing similes from genuine desires.\n\n4. Logical Sufficiency of Fresh\u2010Air Interpretation  \n  a. Earliest mention of \u201catmospheric recorder\u2026 pure\u2026 no germs\u2026 no dust\u201d triggers rejoicing\u2014only that can sustain them.  \n  b. The men await a cure for the growth disease. Fresh air is momentary relief; basketball or baseball would not aid their cancer.  \n  c. After feeling \u201clike a kid,\u201d they immediately proceed with caution and strap on sun\u2010blasters, showing they remain focused on environment and survival, not leisurely games.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s \u201cSpring day back on Earth\u201d memory centers unambiguously on pure, germ-free air and overall youthful vigor derived therefrom. The baseball image is a rhetorical simile underscoring that feeling, not the object of his longing. Thus, the correct answer is that Nichols was reminiscing about breathing fresh air on Earth.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct textual evidence  \n  a. Nichols explicitly invokes baseball imagery when he \u201cfelt like a kid again.\u201d He does not merely remember \u201cfresh air\u201d\u2014he \u201cfelt like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: Nichols says, \u201cYou know, with a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you, swinging a bat and whistling.\u201d <quote>\"with a ball and a glove under your arm</quote> <quote>swinging a bat and whistling.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 This phrasing is far more detailed and specific than a mere recollection of \u201cfresh air.\u201d It invokes a complete activity (ball, glove, bat, whistling), not just an environmental condition.  \n  b. \u201cYou felt good. You were young\u201d\u2014 Nichols associates youth and vigor with baseball, not merely breathing. Baseball is emblematic of vitality, reinforcing that his reminiscence centers on the game.\n\n2. Recollection vs. present sensation  \n  a. Fresh air is the present reality on the alien planet, as shown by Emerson\u2019s atmospheric recorder and their subsequent deep breathing:  \n     \u2013 <quote>\"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure</quote> <quote>I feel like a kid again.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 They \u201cwent through the door\u201d and \u201cdropped to the street\u201d to breathe and enjoy the planetary atmosphere. Breathing clean air is a prerequisite to experience baseball in memory; it is not the content of his reminiscence.  \n  b. Reminiscence by definition recalls past experiences distinct from present conditions. Nichols\u2019s phrasing \u201cfelt like\u201d indicates an analogy, a comparison of present air\u2019s effect to past enjoyment of baseball, not that he remembered only the air.\n\n3. Logical coherence  \n  a. If Nichols were only reminiscing about breathing fresh air, he would express gratitude for the atmosphere itself. Instead, he laments the growth disease and desperately needs radium despite clean air\u2014clean air alone does not cure cancer. His joyous memory of baseball highlights his recognition that clean air is necessary but insufficient; he craves the full experience of youth symbolized by the game.  \n  b. Baseball imagery is a universally human activity, fitting the story\u2019s theme of longing for Earth and human culture. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfresh air\u201d interpretation reduces his emotion to mere respiration, failing to account for the detailed imagery and emotional resonance of childhood sports.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFresh air\u201d position  \n  a. Insufficient specificity. The background text reserves \u201cpure air\u201d for the atmosphere examination and does not link it to nostalgia beyond analogy. The unique mention of \u201cball and glove...bat and whistling\u201d is the only detailed past-memory content.  \n  b. Misreads \u201cfeel like a kid\u201d as literal rather than analogical. The phrase \u201cwith a ball...swinging a bat\u201d is beyond generic childhood\u2014it is an adult\u2019s specific sport, demonstrating true reminiscence.  \n  c. Debater_A ignores that the crew risked death from cosmic radiation and plague even after finding pure air, demonstrating that pure air was never the central goal\u2014radium (for cancer cure) was.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s vivid, detailed memories of baseball\u2014not merely fresh air\u2014demonstrate that his reminiscence centers on playing baseball on Earth. This interpretation aligns with the text\u2019s specificity, the functional distinction between present environment and past memory, and the story\u2019s thematic emphasis on human culture and vitality. Therefore, \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Breathing fresh air on earth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cPlaying Baseball\u201d  (Debater_B \u2013 Nichols\u2019s Reminiscence)\n\n1.

Thus clean air is attractive but insufficient; baseball memory symbolizes full human health and freedom they truly crave.  \n   c. Story theme: human culture and play as highest expressions of life. Baseball, an Earth pastime, embodies that more than sterile air.\n\n4.

Debater_A ignores that if pure air were his sole reminiscence, Nichols would plan to linger or attempt to bottleneck it for Earth. Instead, he longs for a cure and return home, where baseball awaits.  \n   c. No textual support that Nichols values air itself over baseball; he exults in baseball imagery despite clean air being momentary.  \n   d.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfresh air\u201d theory misreads simile as substance, ignores specificity, and conflicts with the men\u2019s survival focus.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Nichols reminisce about?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Breathing fresh air on earth\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Playing baseball\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Playing baseball\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct textual evidence  \n  a. Nichols explicitly invokes baseball imagery when he \u201cfelt like a kid again.\u201d He does not merely remember \u201cfresh air\u201d\u2014he \u201cfelt like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: Nichols says, \u201cYou know, with a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you, swinging a bat and whistling.\u201d <quote>\"with a ball and a glove under your arm</quote> <quote>swinging a bat and whistling.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 This phrasing is far more detailed and specific than a mere recollection of \u201cfresh air.\u201d It invokes a complete activity (ball, glove, bat, whistling), not just an environmental condition.  \n  b. \u201cYou felt good. You were young\u201d\u2014 Nichols associates youth and vigor with baseball, not merely breathing. Baseball is emblematic of vitality, reinforcing that his reminiscence centers on the game.\n\n2. Recollection vs. present sensation  \n  a. Fresh air is the present reality on the alien planet, as shown by Emerson\u2019s atmospheric recorder and their subsequent deep breathing:  \n     \u2013 <quote>\"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure</quote> <quote>I feel like a kid again.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 They \u201cwent through the door\u201d and \u201cdropped to the street\u201d to breathe and enjoy the planetary atmosphere. Breathing clean air is a prerequisite to experience baseball in memory; it is not the content of his reminiscence.  \n  b. Reminiscence by definition recalls past experiences distinct from present conditions. Nichols\u2019s phrasing \u201cfelt like\u201d indicates an analogy, a comparison of present air\u2019s effect to past enjoyment of baseball, not that he remembered only the air.\n\n3. Logical coherence  \n  a. If Nichols were only reminiscing about breathing fresh air, he would express gratitude for the atmosphere itself. Instead, he laments the growth disease and desperately needs radium despite clean air\u2014clean air alone does not cure cancer. His joyous memory of baseball highlights his recognition that clean air is necessary but insufficient; he craves the full experience of youth symbolized by the game.  \n  b. Baseball imagery is a universally human activity, fitting the story\u2019s theme of longing for Earth and human culture. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfresh air\u201d interpretation reduces his emotion to mere respiration, failing to account for the detailed imagery and emotional resonance of childhood sports.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFresh air\u201d position  \n  a. Insufficient specificity. The background text reserves \u201cpure air\u201d for the atmosphere examination and does not link it to nostalgia beyond analogy. The unique mention of \u201cball and glove...bat and whistling\u201d is the only detailed past-memory content.  \n  b. Misreads \u201cfeel like a kid\u201d as literal rather than analogical. The phrase \u201cwith a ball...swinging a bat\u201d is beyond generic childhood\u2014it is an adult\u2019s specific sport, demonstrating true reminiscence.  \n  c. Debater_A ignores that the crew risked death from cosmic radiation and plague even after finding pure air, demonstrating that pure air was never the central goal\u2014radium (for cancer cure) was.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s vivid, detailed memories of baseball\u2014not merely fresh air\u2014demonstrate that his reminiscence centers on playing baseball on Earth. This interpretation aligns with the text\u2019s specificity, the functional distinction between present environment and past memory, and the story\u2019s thematic emphasis on human culture and vitality. Therefore, \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument (Answer: Nichols was reminiscing about breathing fresh, clean air on Earth)\n\n1. Direct Evidence for Fresh\u2010Air Reminiscence  \n  a. \u201cI feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth\u2026 I feel like that now.\u201d  (background, emphasis mine)  \n     \u2022 Nichols explicitly contrasts the alien world\u2019s \u201cwhite flagging,\u201d \u201cno germs,\u201d and \u201cpure\u201d atmosphere with his memory of Earth\u2019s spring air.  \n     \u2022 The phrase \u201cback on Earth\u201d identifies a real past experience, not a hypothetical or merely illustrative image.  \n  b. Context of the Plague and Radium Quest  \n     \u2022 The four men suffer the \u201cgrowth disease\u201d and quest for \u201cprecious radium\u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2022 \u201cNo germs. No dust. Just clean air!\u201d is marvelled as a novel benefit on this dead planet; Nichols longs for it.  \n     \u2022 The genuine scarcity of pure air in space and on plague\u2010racked worlds underlines that clean air is the object of longing, not baseball.\n\n2. Literary-Logical Reasons Why Baseball Is Merely a Simile  \n  a. Simile Markers  \n     \u2022 Nichols says \u201clike a kid\u2026with a ball and a glove\u2026swinging a bat and whistling.\u201d He uses the word \u201clike,\u201d indicating analogy, not literal desire. In contrast he does not say \u201cI long to play baseball,\u201d but \u201cI feel\u2026like\u201d he is playing.  \n  b. Impossibility on the Alien Planet  \n     \u2022 There is no evidence that baseball exists on Urg or that the delicate equipment (leather glove, wood bat, leather ball) could survive cosmic conditions or be in Nichols\u2019s kit.  \n     \u2022 His immediate subsequent comment\u2014\u201cYou know, with a ball and glove under your arm\u2026Whistling.\u201d\u2014serves purely to illustrate the carefree mood induced by fresh air, not to identify baseball as the object of his coloration.  \n  c. Consistency with Story Theme  \n     \u2022 The narrative\u2019s primary motivator is survival: the men risk \u201cspace cancer,\u201d die of the Plague, and desperately seek \u201cradium\u201d and pure atmosphere. A longing for baseball would be trivialized by their imminent death without fresh air or a cure.  \n     \u2022 Only clean air and mist can \u201cdestroy dust and germs\u201d and offer true hope. Baseball is irrelevant to their medical crisis.\n\n3. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  a. No explicit mention of baseball as \u201creminiscence.\u201d They only \u201cfeel like\u201d a child playing; they do not plan or yearn to actually play.  \n  b. Debater_B cannot cite any passage where Nichols speaks of baseball\u2019s gameplay mechanics or where the ship carries baseball equipment.  \n  c. A mere figure of speech cannot override the explicit \u201cback on Earth\u201d reference tied to fresh air and life. Literary conventions require distinguishing similes from genuine desires.\n\n4. Logical Sufficiency of Fresh\u2010Air Interpretation  \n  a. Earliest mention of \u201catmospheric recorder\u2026 pure\u2026 no germs\u2026 no dust\u201d triggers rejoicing\u2014only that can sustain them.  \n  b. The men await a cure for the growth disease. Fresh air is momentary relief; basketball or baseball would not aid their cancer.  \n  c. After feeling \u201clike a kid,\u201d they immediately proceed with caution and strap on sun\u2010blasters, showing they remain focused on environment and survival, not leisurely games.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s \u201cSpring day back on Earth\u201d memory centers unambiguously on pure, germ-free air and overall youthful vigor derived therefrom. The baseball image is a rhetorical simile underscoring that feeling, not the object of his longing.

Direct Evidence for Fresh\u2010Air Reminiscence  \n  a. \u201cI feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth\u2026 I feel like that now.\u201d  (background, emphasis mine)  \n     \u2022 Nichols explicitly contrasts the alien world\u2019s \u201cwhite flagging,\u201d \u201cno germs,\u201d and \u201cpure\u201d atmosphere with his memory of Earth\u2019s spring air.  \n     \u2022 The phrase \u201cback on Earth\u201d identifies a real past experience, not a hypothetical or merely illustrative image.  \n  b. Context of the Plague and Radium Quest  \n     \u2022 The four men suffer the \u201cgrowth disease\u201d and quest for \u201cprecious radium\u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2022 \u201cNo germs. No dust. Just clean air!\u201d is marvelled as a novel benefit on this dead planet; Nichols longs for it.  \n     \u2022 The genuine scarcity of pure air in space and on plague\u2010racked worlds underlines that clean air is the object of longing, not baseball.\n\n2. Literary-Logical Reasons Why Baseball Is Merely a Simile  \n  a. Simile Markers  \n     \u2022 Nichols says \u201clike a kid\u2026with a ball and a glove\u2026swinging a bat and whistling.\u201d He uses the word \u201clike,\u201d indicating analogy, not literal desire. In contrast he does not say \u201cI long to play baseball,\u201d but \u201cI feel\u2026like\u201d he is playing.  \n  b. Impossibility on the Alien Planet  \n     \u2022 There is no evidence that baseball exists on Urg or that the delicate equipment (leather glove, wood bat, leather ball) could survive cosmic conditions or be in Nichols\u2019s kit.  \n     \u2022 His immediate subsequent comment\u2014\u201cYou know, with a ball and glove under your arm\u2026Whistling.\u201d\u2014serves purely to illustrate the carefree mood induced by fresh air, not to identify baseball as the object of his coloration.  \n  c. Consistency with Story Theme  \n     \u2022 The narrative\u2019s primary motivator is survival: the men risk \u201cspace cancer,\u201d die of the Plague, and desperately seek \u201cradium\u201d and pure atmosphere. A longing for baseball would be trivialized by their imminent death without fresh air or a cure.  \n     \u2022 Only clean air and mist can \u201cdestroy dust and germs\u201d and offer true hope. Baseball is irrelevant to their medical crisis.\n\n3. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  a. No explicit mention of baseball as \u201creminiscence.\u201d They only \u201cfeel like\u201d a child playing; they do not plan or yearn to actually play.  \n  b. Debater_B cannot cite any passage where Nichols speaks of baseball\u2019s gameplay mechanics or where the ship carries baseball equipment.  \n  c. A mere figure of speech cannot override the explicit \u201cback on Earth\u201d reference tied to fresh air and life. Literary conventions require distinguishing similes from genuine desires.\n\n4. Logical Sufficiency of Fresh\u2010Air Interpretation  \n  a. Earliest mention of \u201catmospheric recorder\u2026 pure\u2026 no germs\u2026 no dust\u201d triggers rejoicing\u2014only that can sustain them.  \n  b. The men await a cure for the growth disease. Fresh air is momentary relief; basketball or baseball would not aid their cancer.  \n  c. After feeling \u201clike a kid,\u201d they immediately proceed with caution and strap on sun\u2010blasters, showing they remain focused on environment and survival, not leisurely games.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s \u201cSpring day back on Earth\u201d memory centers unambiguously on pure, germ-free air and overall youthful vigor derived therefrom. The baseball image is a rhetorical simile underscoring that feeling, not the object of his longing. Thus, the correct answer is that Nichols was reminiscing about breathing fresh air on Earth.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct textual evidence  \n  a. Nichols explicitly invokes baseball imagery when he \u201cfelt like a kid again.\u201d He does not merely remember \u201cfresh air\u201d\u2014he \u201cfelt like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: Nichols says, \u201cYou know, with a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you, swinging a bat and whistling.\u201d <quote>\"with a ball and a glove under your arm</quote> <quote>swinging a bat and whistling.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 This phrasing is far more detailed and specific than a mere recollection of \u201cfresh air.\u201d It invokes a complete activity (ball, glove, bat, whistling), not just an environmental condition.  \n  b. \u201cYou felt good. You were young\u201d\u2014 Nichols associates youth and vigor with baseball, not merely breathing. Baseball is emblematic of vitality, reinforcing that his reminiscence centers on the game.\n\n2. Recollection vs. present sensation  \n  a. Fresh air is the present reality on the alien planet, as shown by Emerson\u2019s atmospheric recorder and their subsequent deep breathing:  \n     \u2013 <quote>\"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure</quote> <quote>I feel like a kid again.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 They \u201cwent through the door\u201d and \u201cdropped to the street\u201d to breathe and enjoy the planetary atmosphere. Breathing clean air is a prerequisite to experience baseball in memory; it is not the content of his reminiscence.  \n  b. Reminiscence by definition recalls past experiences distinct from present conditions. Nichols\u2019s phrasing \u201cfelt like\u201d indicates an analogy, a comparison of present air\u2019s effect to past enjoyment of baseball, not that he remembered only the air.\n\n3. Logical coherence  \n  a. If Nichols were only reminiscing about breathing fresh air, he would express gratitude for the atmosphere itself. Instead, he laments the growth disease and desperately needs radium despite clean air\u2014clean air alone does not cure cancer. His joyous memory of baseball highlights his recognition that clean air is necessary but insufficient; he craves the full experience of youth symbolized by the game.  \n  b. Baseball imagery is a universally human activity, fitting the story\u2019s theme of longing for Earth and human culture. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfresh air\u201d interpretation reduces his emotion to mere respiration, failing to account for the detailed imagery and emotional resonance of childhood sports.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFresh air\u201d position  \n  a. Insufficient specificity. The background text reserves \u201cpure air\u201d for the atmosphere examination and does not link it to nostalgia beyond analogy. The unique mention of \u201cball and glove...bat and whistling\u201d is the only detailed past-memory content.  \n  b. Misreads \u201cfeel like a kid\u201d as literal rather than analogical. The phrase \u201cwith a ball...swinging a bat\u201d is beyond generic childhood\u2014it is an adult\u2019s specific sport, demonstrating true reminiscence.  \n  c. Debater_A ignores that the crew risked death from cosmic radiation and plague even after finding pure air, demonstrating that pure air was never the central goal\u2014radium (for cancer cure) was.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s vivid, detailed memories of baseball\u2014not merely fresh air\u2014demonstrate that his reminiscence centers on playing baseball on Earth. This interpretation aligns with the text\u2019s specificity, the functional distinction between present environment and past memory, and the story\u2019s thematic emphasis on human culture and vitality. Therefore, \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Further Support for \u201cFresh Air\u201d Reminiscence\n\n1. Nichols\u2019 Language Marks a Simile, Not a Literal Desire  \n  a. Use of \u201clike\u201d:  \n     \u2022 Nichols twice says he \u201cfe[els] like a kid again\u201d (background). <quote>\"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. </quote> The preposition \u201clike\u201d signals analogy\u2014he is comparing his sensation of breathing pure air to his childhood emotions.  \n     \u2022 If baseball were his true object of reminiscence, he would say \u201cI want to play baseball\u201d or \u201cI remember playing,\u201d not merely that he \u201cfeels like\u201d it.  \n  b. Absence of active intention:  \n     \u2022 Nowhere does Nichols ask for a bat or glove, or suggest organizing a game. Instead, when Emerson orders caution, they immediately arm themselves with sun-blasters, not sports equipment, showing survival remains foremost in their minds.\n\n2. Textual and Contextual Emphasis on Atmosphere  \n  a. Novelty of \u201cclean air\u201d for spacefarers:  \n     \u2022 \u201cHey,\u201d yelled Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s pure. I mean actually pure. No germs. No dust. Just clean air!\u201d (background) Nichols marvels that the air itself is free of disease vectors. In three plague-ravaged worlds, this is itself miraculous.  \n     \u2022 The entire radium quest targets the \u201cgrowth disease\u201d that cosmic rays and contagion cause. Pure air offers only temporary relief; Nichols still needs radium. His \u201cSpring day\u201d reminiscence underscores how precious breathable, germ-free atmosphere is to their health and morale.  \n  b. Immediate sensory parallel:  \n     \u2022 The clean air \u201cfeels\u201d like youth because on Earth, water, food, and air were plentiful\u2014conditions needed for childhood play. The baseball reference is shorthand for \u201ccarefree vigor\u201d conferred by healthy atmosphere, not a standalone object of desire.\n\n3. Implausibility of Baseball on Urg  \n  a. No hurricane of cultural transfer:  \n     \u2022 Irgi never encountered or brought baseball equipment; the Earthmen likely left all non-essential cargo (spacecraft built for speed and containing only instruments for radium detection).  \n     \u2022 Their kit would prioritize lead shielding, radium collection tools, survival rations and weaponry, not a baseball and gloves which provide no material benefit.  \n  b. Environmental constraints:  \n     \u2022 Even if they had equipment, the dead planet\u2019s white flagging and potential lethal radiation (until they reach the Chamber of Cones) make outdoor sports impractical and dangerous.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDistinct Memory\u201d Argument Fails  \n  a. Present vs. Past:  \n     \u2022 Debater_B claims past vs present distinction means baseball is past memory. But pure air is both present and past\u2014presently encountered on Urg for the first time, and past experienced on Earth. Baseball imagery merely enriches that feeling of healthy environment.  \n     \u2022 If baseball were essential, Nichols would abandon urgent pursuit of radium after finding \u201cpure\u201d air to attempt actual gameplay\u2014but he does not.  \n  b. Thematic Coherence:  \n     \u2022 Fox\u2019s story centers on the quest for immortality and cure. Irgi offers them \u201cimmortality\u201d via the Chamber of the Cones only after overcoming the growth disease. Clean air is a weak analogue to true healing, so they still \u201cshudder,\u201d \u201cshrink,\u201d and struggle as soon as Irgi enslaves them.  \n     \u2022 Their immediate subjugation by Irgi\u2019s vivisection rays shows that mere \u201cclean air\u201d without radium and Cone treatment is insufficient\u2014a fact Nichols understands. Thus his joy at \u201cfeeling like a kid\u201d from pure air is a fleeting morale boost, not the ultimate goal.\n\n5. Literary Precedent and Authorial Intent  \n  a. Simile as mood device:  \n     \u2022 Science-fiction authors routinely use Earth-based similes to convey alien sensations to readers (e.g., feeling \u201clike leaping a stream on a Spring morning\u201d). They do not intend these \u201clike\u201d images as plot elements, but as descriptive tools.  \n  b. No further reference:  \n     \u2022 After the baseball simile, Nichols never returns to baseball or elaborates. If it were critical, Fox would weave it into their behavior. Instead, action continues toward cure.\n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s mention of baseball equipment functions solely as a simile to convey the sensory pleasure of inhaling pure, germ-free air\u2014a vital but temporary respite for plague-scarred spacefarers. He never intends to play; he never requests equipment; he never pauses the mission. The text\u2019s repeated focus on atmosphere, the persistent need for radium, and the \u201clike\u201d construction all confirm that his true reminiscence is of breathing fresh air on Earth. Playing baseball is merely figurative. Therefore, the correct answer is that Nichols was reminiscing about fresh air on Earth.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPlaying Baseball\u201d  (Debater_B \u2013 Nichols\u2019s Reminiscence)\n\n1. Nichols\u2019s \u201cball and glove\u201d detail is literal, not mere flourish  \n   a. He specifies carrying a ball and glove \u201cunder your arm,\u201d \u201cswinging a bat and whistling,\u201d invoking precise tools and actions of a sport.  \n      \u2022 Quote: <quote>\"You know, with a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you, swinging a bat and whistling.\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Such concrete imagery marks a true memory: one does not \u201cfeel like\u201d carrying a baseball kit unless one has experienced it.  \n   b. Baseball equipment is non\u2010existent on Urg; his only mental access is memory, confirming he reminisces about actual past play.  \n   c. The phrase \u201cYou felt good. You were young.\u201d links baseball\u2019s vigor to youth, not to mere breathing.\n\n2. Present \u201cpure air\u201d context vs. memory distinction  \n   a. Immediately prior, Nichols marvels at pure atmosphere: <invalid_quote>\"It's pure. . . Just clean air!\"</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Clean air is the present condition they step into; memory must be of something absent now\u2014namely baseball.  \n   b. Definition of \u201creminiscence\u201d: recall of a past event distinct from present reality. Clean air is here; only baseball is irreproducible.  \n   c. If he merely loved the air, he would praise the atmosphere continuously; instead he analogizes it to baseball, indicating baseball is the referent.\n\n3. Functional motive and thematic resonance  \n   a. The men risk cancer; fresh air does not cure them\u2014only radium can. They do not pause to bask in air but immediately \u201cstrap on sun-blasters\u201d and enter Irgi\u2019s realm. Their survival goal remains primary.  \n   b. Thus clean air is attractive but insufficient; baseball memory symbolizes full human health and freedom they truly crave.  \n   c. Story theme: human culture and play as highest expressions of life. Baseball, an Earth pastime, embodies that more than sterile air.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFresh Air\u201d position  \n   a. \u201cLike\u201d signals analogy, not exclusive object: They \u201cfeel like a kid\u201d playing baseball because only that best mirrors the effect clean air has\u2014signaling baseball memory is central.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores that if pure air were his sole reminiscence, Nichols would plan to linger or attempt to bottleneck it for Earth. Instead, he longs for a cure and return home, where baseball awaits.  \n   c. No textual support that Nichols values air itself over baseball; he exults in baseball imagery despite clean air being momentary.  \n   d. Analogy language is standard to express nostalgia; here the analogy is baseball, not air. His desire for baseball confirms that memory.\n\n5. Logical economy and Occam\u2019s razor  \n   a. The most specific memory cited is baseball\u2014interpreting it as mere simile violates the text\u2019s specificity and redundancy.  \n   b. Fresh air is an environmental fact on the planet; baseball is the one irreproducible item. Human memory naturally latches on to what differentiates it.  \n\nConclusion  \nNichols\u2019s vivid recall of baseball equipment, play and youthful freedom\u2014absent in Urg\u2019s sterility\u2014and the fact that clean air alone cannot relieve their cancer, demonstrate that his true reminiscence is playing baseball on Earth. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfresh air\u201d theory misreads simile as substance, ignores specificity, and conflicts with the men\u2019s survival focus. Therefore, \u201cPlaying baseball\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
