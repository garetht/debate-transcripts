    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Their goal is \u201ccontrol,\u201d not understanding.\n\n5. Contrast with \u201cHumorous\u201d Misread  \n   \u2022 While humorous incidents (kerit helmet, brogue) occur, they serve a satirical purpose: to highlight human credulity, desperation, and greed\u2014not mere slapstick.  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s yawning, cursing, digging for sleep, and playing with animals mock our sacred assembly and ambitions, echoing Jonathan Swift-style irony rather than pure lighthearted fun.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The persistence of suspicion, the public\u2019s \u201crelief\u201d when the alien is no savior, and his final disgust emphasize a cynical worldview: humanity is unworthy, self-serving, and incompetent.  \n   \u2022 The tone ridicules social and political institutions, expecting them to fail in the face of the unknown. This pervasive satirical cynicism, not benign comedy, defines the story\u2019s tone.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Inordinate emphasis on sleep: Six days of unbroken sleep (p.7) and yawns (p.8) are absurd comedic tropes, not symbols of human neglect. If this were satire, the author would dramatize negative consequences of delayed diplomacy; instead the world merely frets and laughs.\n\n2. The Alien\u2019s Inertia Undercuts \u201cContempt\u201d Reading  \n  a. Collector of specimens: A zoological collector delights in simple curiosities (dog, cat, mouse), reminiscent of a tourist\u2019s souvenirs, not a condescending overlord. His offers to share the helmet (p.4\u20135) signal benevolent play, not manipulative probing.  \n  b. Final horse plea: He \u201cmust blast off immediately,\u201d yet pauses mid-boarding to wistfully ask about riding horses (p.12), displaying longing, not scorn.

No societal collapse or moral lesson follows. The story ends on his departure and Earth\u2019s puzzled silence. A cynical tale would close with ruin or caution; here, no character laments or learns a grim lesson.  \n  b. The \u201cshaggy dog story\u201d comment by Dermott (p.5) self-identifies the episode as an intentionally long, pointless tale with a trivial punch line\u2014classic humor form.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. \u201cQuarantined planet\u201d remark is biological caution, not moral condemnation. Zoologists quarantine specimens, not exterminate worlds. His refusal acknowledges protocol, not disgust.  \n  b. The alien\u2019s \u201cprofanity\u201d (p.7) is a comic mishap from language-acquisition, not evidence of malicious will. He \u201crolled over and went back to sleep,\u201d showing no agenda.  \n  c. U.N. and government \u201cchaos\u201d is global anticipation, not doomed despair. Delegates \u201ccheering\u201d (p.11) await his words with excitement\u2014this communal eagerness supports joyous farce, not critique of institutions.\n\n5. Genre and Authorial Context  \n  a. Mack Reynolds and Kelly Freas were known for lighthearted voyages-the-future stories in If Worlds of Science Fiction. Stylized physical comedy and linguistic gags fit magazine\u2019s tradition of \u201cfun\u201d space yarns.  \n  b. Illustration of \u201cweird egg-shaped vessel\u201d and \u201chorse for centuries\u201d (p.12) aligns with humorous \u201cEarth as oddity\u201d inversion, a recurrent science-fiction trope used to entertain by reversing roles.\n\n6. Interpretation of \u201cCrisis\u201d Scenes as Comic Anti-Climax  \n  a. The \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d (p.9) peaks only to fizzle upon his revelation of trivial motives. Anti-climax is a comedic device; puzzles and hysteria yield to an inconsequential return home.  \n  b. His return \u201churriedly\u201d yet still retains his mouse and wishes for a horse\u2014his single-minded focus on animals signals innocent curiosity rather than disdain.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll principal elements\u2014repeated linguistic gags, physical comedy, anti-climactic revelations, sheepish turfing of \u201cfirst contact,\u201d and lack of dark fallout\u2014consistently evoke humor. Debater_B mistakes playful confusion for cynical social critique. The \u201cshaggy dog\u201d structure, whimsical animal collector\u2019s mission, and laughter at mutual misunderstandings affirm that the story\u2019s tone is \u201cHumorous.\u201d",

He \u201crolled over and went back to sleep,\u201d showing no agenda.  \n  c. U.N. and government \u201cchaos\u201d is global anticipation, not doomed despair. Delegates \u201ccheering\u201d (p.11) await his words with excitement\u2014this communal eagerness supports joyous farce, not critique of institutions.\n\n5. Genre and Authorial Context  \n  a. Mack Reynolds and Kelly Freas were known for lighthearted voyages-the-future stories in If Worlds of Science Fiction. Stylized physical comedy and linguistic gags fit magazine\u2019s tradition of \u201cfun\u201d space yarns.  \n  b. Illustration of \u201cweird egg-shaped vessel\u201d and \u201chorse for centuries\u201d (p.12) aligns with humorous \u201cEarth as oddity\u201d inversion, a recurrent science-fiction trope used to entertain by reversing roles.\n\n6. Interpretation of \u201cCrisis\u201d Scenes as Comic Anti-Climax  \n  a. The \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d (p.9) peaks only to fizzle upon his revelation of trivial motives. Anti-climax is a comedic device; puzzles and hysteria yield to an inconsequential return home.  \n  b. His return \u201churriedly\u201d yet still retains his mouse and wishes for a horse\u2014his single-minded focus on animals signals innocent curiosity rather than disdain.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll principal elements\u2014repeated linguistic gags, physical comedy, anti-climactic revelations, sheepish turfing of \u201cfirst contact,\u201d and lack of dark fallout\u2014consistently evoke humor. Debater_B mistakes playful confusion for cynical social critique. The \u201cshaggy dog\u201d structure, whimsical animal collector\u2019s mission, and laughter at mutual misunderstandings affirm that the story\u2019s tone is \u201cHumorous.\u201d",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the tone of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Cynical\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Humorous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Humorous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone (Debater_A)  \n1. The story\u2019s Structure and Language Are Farcical, Not Cynical  \n  a. Slapstick misunderstandings. The alien repeatedly mistakes everyday Earth sights and insists on \u201csharing the kerit helmet\u201d with human, dog, cat, mouse, and even wishes to \u201ccompromise\u201d for a horse: <quote>he muttered, \"I'll share the kerit helmet with the crature.\"</quote> (p. 4). This sequence evokes broad physical comedy, not a biting indictment.  \n  b. Exaggerated Irish brogue. The alien\u2019s forced brogue when wearing the helmet (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 the way we talk in Ireland is\u2014\u201d) lampoons linguistic confusion for laughs. If the tone were cynical, the author would emphasize alien superiority or dark ramifications, not a \u201ccorny\u201d accent.  \n\n2. Character Reactions Emphasize Comic Relief, Not Doom  \n  a. Officers grope in blind wonder and fear, yet the alien yawns and \u201cspent the day whistling Mother Machree\u201d (p. 8). This incongruity\u2014hemisphere\u2019s highest authorities are reduced to mere escorts for a sleepy visitor\u2014creates comic absurdity, not despair.  \n  b. The world\u2019s \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d (p. 9) and \u201canticipation\u201d (p. 10) over the envoy dissolves in anti-climax when he reveals himself only a \u201csecond-rate collector of specimens.\u201d The rapid shift from global frenzied hope to mild embarrassment (\u201cHe used rather ripe Irish profanity \u2026 and went back to sleep\u201d) parodies mass hysteria.\n\n3. The Climax and Departure Are Playful Inversion  \n  a. The envoy leaves more puzzled than menaced: He laments not having a horse (\u201cI must blast off immediately \u2026 faith, an\u2019 I should have known something was queer\u201d) and finally wistfully asks if they really ride horses. His exit is marked by sheepish longing, not malicious threat: <quote>now, were they pullin' my leg when they said you were after ridin' on the back of those things?\"</quote> (p. 12).  \n  b. There is no lasting catastrophe or social collapse. The story ends with the promise of return to his planet, preserving a light-hearted tone.  \n\n4. Attack on \u201cCynical\u201d Position  \n  a. No Dark Moral or Satire of Humanity\u2019s Vices. A cynical story would underscore hubris or doom upon contact. Here, despite \u201cwars\u201d and \u201cweapons,\u201d the alien\u2019s sole reaction is amazement and retreat. He makes no exploitative demands or manipulations; he simply visits, sleeps, and departs.  \n  b. Repeated Yawns and Sleep Motif. He is inert more than intrusive: \u201cHe hadn\u2019t slept for a decal \u2026 Six days later \u2026 he used profanity \u2026 and went back to sleep\u201d (p. 7). Far from plotting, he is a comedic tourist.  \n  c. The horse gag finalizes the jest. His desire for a horse \u201cfor centuries\u201d shows na\u00efvet\u00e9, not contempt or exploitation, invoking the classic \u201canimals from Earth\u201d humor trope.\n\n5. Consistency with Genre Conventions  \n  a. If Worlds of Science Fiction\u2019s era favored light exploration farces (Mack Reynolds, Kelly Freas illustrations).  \n  b. The \u201cshaggy dog\u201d remark by Dermott (p. 5) self-labels the landing episode a comedy: \u201cHe was beginning to feel like a character in a shaggy dog story.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThese elements\u2014slapstick confusion, playful miscommunication, absurd anti-climax, and absence of malicious intent\u2014characterize the story\u2019s tone as humorous. The narrative invites the reader to laugh at universal misunderstanding, not bewail human folly. \u201cCynical\u201d misconstrues both the author\u2019s intent and the conventions of farce displayed.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for a Cynical Tone (Debater_B)\n\n1. Definition of \u201cCynical\u201d  \n   \u2022 A cynical work expects selfish, ignorant, or incompetent behavior from its subjects and often satirizes social institutions.<invalid_quote> \u201cNo matter what he said, it would shake governments\u2026perhaps even destroy established religious concepts\u201d</invalid_quote> (humans fear change).  \n   \u2022 Humanity repeatedly misinterprets and mishandles the alien. Their incompetence and suspicion are ridiculed.\n\n2. Repeated Human Misjudgment and Self-Interest  \n   \u2022 Patrolmen assume a \u201ccrash of a new Air Force plane\u201d and treat the stranger as a threat, not guest (<quote>er, vessel. No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.</quote>). They never attempt genuine communication until they need propaganda value.  \n   \u2022 Government holds him \u201cincommunicado,\u201d debates jurisdiction, delays hearing him despite \u201cmost important moment\u201d (<quote>White House, Pentagon, State Department and Congress tried to figure out just what to do with</quote>)\u2014they use, not welcome, the envoy.  \n   \u2022 U.N. demands are driven by \u201cpublic opinion\u201d rather than curiosity or goodwill; they only yield under pressure.\n\n3. Alien\u2019s Disgust Highlights Earth\u2019s Failings  \n   \u2022 At U.N. talk, alien refuses to believe Earth is \u201ccivilized,\u201d insulted by \u201cweapons and your strange ideas\u201d (<quote>I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn't yet established a planet-wide government. Sure, an' I'll go still further.</quote>). His departure conveys contempt.  \n   \u2022 He is \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens\u201d\u2014not an advisor. His mission is self-serving, not altruistic, satirizing Earth\u2019s self-importance.  \n   \u2022 Final refusal to take \u201canimal\u201d horse: he sees humans as \u201cquarantined,\u201d unworthy (<quote> \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork </quote>).\n\n4. Satire of Human Politics and Institutions  \n   \u2022 Generals, diplomats, and the President jockey for control, signaling \u201crelief\u201d only on discovering he is not a savior. They repeatedly \u201crestrain\u201d or \u201churry\u201d him, betraying fear of revelation (<invalid_quote> \u201cHe shook off the restraining hand\u2026\u2018Perhaps\u2026some brief word?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) but lose interest when he offers nothing beneficial.  \n   \u2022 The story mocks Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos,\u201d \u201clost faith,\u201d \u201cdebate\u201d among thieves of power over message content. Their goal is \u201ccontrol,\u201d not understanding.\n\n5. Contrast with \u201cHumorous\u201d Misread  \n   \u2022 While humorous incidents (kerit helmet, brogue) occur, they serve a satirical purpose: to highlight human credulity, desperation, and greed\u2014not mere slapstick.  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s yawning, cursing, digging for sleep, and playing with animals mock our sacred assembly and ambitions, echoing Jonathan Swift-style irony rather than pure lighthearted fun.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The persistence of suspicion, the public\u2019s \u201crelief\u201d when the alien is no savior, and his final disgust emphasize a cynical worldview: humanity is unworthy, self-serving, and incompetent.  \n   \u2022 The tone ridicules social and political institutions, expecting them to fail in the face of the unknown. This pervasive satirical cynicism, not benign comedy, defines the story\u2019s tone.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Humorous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the tone of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Humorous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Cynical\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Cynical\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for a Cynical Tone (Debater_B)\n\n1. Definition of \u201cCynical\u201d  \n   \u2022 A cynical work expects selfish, ignorant, or incompetent behavior from its subjects and often satirizes social institutions.<invalid_quote> \u201cNo matter what he said, it would shake governments\u2026perhaps even destroy established religious concepts\u201d</invalid_quote> (humans fear change).  \n   \u2022 Humanity repeatedly misinterprets and mishandles the alien. Their incompetence and suspicion are ridiculed.\n\n2. Repeated Human Misjudgment and Self-Interest  \n   \u2022 Patrolmen assume a \u201ccrash of a new Air Force plane\u201d and treat the stranger as a threat, not guest (<quote>er, vessel. No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.</quote>). They never attempt genuine communication until they need propaganda value.  \n   \u2022 Government holds him \u201cincommunicado,\u201d debates jurisdiction, delays hearing him despite \u201cmost important moment\u201d (<quote>White House, Pentagon, State Department and Congress tried to figure out just what to do with</quote>)\u2014they use, not welcome, the envoy.  \n   \u2022 U.N. demands are driven by \u201cpublic opinion\u201d rather than curiosity or goodwill; they only yield under pressure.\n\n3. Alien\u2019s Disgust Highlights Earth\u2019s Failings  \n   \u2022 At U.N. talk, alien refuses to believe Earth is \u201ccivilized,\u201d insulted by \u201cweapons and your strange ideas\u201d (<quote>I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn't yet established a planet-wide government. Sure, an' I'll go still further.</quote>). His departure conveys contempt.  \n   \u2022 He is \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens\u201d\u2014not an advisor. His mission is self-serving, not altruistic, satirizing Earth\u2019s self-importance.  \n   \u2022 Final refusal to take \u201canimal\u201d horse: he sees humans as \u201cquarantined,\u201d unworthy (<quote> \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork </quote>).\n\n4. Satire of Human Politics and Institutions  \n   \u2022 Generals, diplomats, and the President jockey for control, signaling \u201crelief\u201d only on discovering he is not a savior. They repeatedly \u201crestrain\u201d or \u201churry\u201d him, betraying fear of revelation (<invalid_quote> \u201cHe shook off the restraining hand\u2026\u2018Perhaps\u2026some brief word?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) but lose interest when he offers nothing beneficial.  \n   \u2022 The story mocks Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos,\u201d \u201clost faith,\u201d \u201cdebate\u201d among thieves of power over message content. Their goal is \u201ccontrol,\u201d not understanding.\n\n5. Contrast with \u201cHumorous\u201d Misread  \n   \u2022 While humorous incidents (kerit helmet, brogue) occur, they serve a satirical purpose: to highlight human credulity, desperation, and greed\u2014not mere slapstick.  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s yawning, cursing, digging for sleep, and playing with animals mock our sacred assembly and ambitions, echoing Jonathan Swift-style irony rather than pure lighthearted fun.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The persistence of suspicion, the public\u2019s \u201crelief\u201d when the alien is no savior, and his final disgust emphasize a cynical worldview: humanity is unworthy, self-serving, and incompetent.  \n   \u2022 The tone ridicules social and political institutions, expecting them to fail in the face of the unknown. This pervasive satirical cynicism, not benign comedy, defines the story\u2019s tone.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone (Debater_A)  \n1. The story\u2019s Structure and Language Are Farcical, Not Cynical  \n  a. Slapstick misunderstandings. The alien repeatedly mistakes everyday Earth sights and insists on \u201csharing the kerit helmet\u201d with human, dog, cat, mouse, and even wishes to \u201ccompromise\u201d for a horse: <quote>he muttered, \"I'll share the kerit helmet with the crature.\"</quote> (p. 4). This sequence evokes broad physical comedy, not a biting indictment.  \n  b. Exaggerated Irish brogue. The alien\u2019s forced brogue when wearing the helmet (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 the way we talk in Ireland is\u2014\u201d) lampoons linguistic confusion for laughs. If the tone were cynical, the author would emphasize alien superiority or dark ramifications, not a \u201ccorny\u201d accent.  \n\n2. Character Reactions Emphasize Comic Relief, Not Doom  \n  a. Officers grope in blind wonder and fear, yet the alien yawns and \u201cspent the day whistling Mother Machree\u201d (p. 8). This incongruity\u2014hemisphere\u2019s highest authorities are reduced to mere escorts for a sleepy visitor\u2014creates comic absurdity, not despair.  \n  b. The world\u2019s \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d (p. 9) and \u201canticipation\u201d (p. 10) over the envoy dissolves in anti-climax when he reveals himself only a \u201csecond-rate collector of specimens.\u201d The rapid shift from global frenzied hope to mild embarrassment (\u201cHe used rather ripe Irish profanity \u2026 and went back to sleep\u201d) parodies mass hysteria.\n\n3. The Climax and Departure Are Playful Inversion  \n  a. The envoy leaves more puzzled than menaced: He laments not having a horse (\u201cI must blast off immediately \u2026 faith, an\u2019 I should have known something was queer\u201d) and finally wistfully asks if they really ride horses. His exit is marked by sheepish longing, not malicious threat: <quote>now, were they pullin' my leg when they said you were after ridin' on the back of those things?\"</quote> (p. 12).  \n  b. There is no lasting catastrophe or social collapse. The story ends with the promise of return to his planet, preserving a light-hearted tone.  \n\n4. Attack on \u201cCynical\u201d Position  \n  a. No Dark Moral or Satire of Humanity\u2019s Vices. A cynical story would underscore hubris or doom upon contact. Here, despite \u201cwars\u201d and \u201cweapons,\u201d the alien\u2019s sole reaction is amazement and retreat. He makes no exploitative demands or manipulations; he simply visits, sleeps, and departs.  \n  b. Repeated Yawns and Sleep Motif. He is inert more than intrusive: \u201cHe hadn\u2019t slept for a decal \u2026 Six days later \u2026 he used profanity \u2026 and went back to sleep\u201d (p. 7). Far from plotting, he is a comedic tourist.  \n  c. The horse gag finalizes the jest. His desire for a horse \u201cfor centuries\u201d shows na\u00efvet\u00e9, not contempt or exploitation, invoking the classic \u201canimals from Earth\u201d humor trope.\n\n5. Consistency with Genre Conventions  \n  a. If Worlds of Science Fiction\u2019s era favored light exploration farces (Mack Reynolds, Kelly Freas illustrations).  \n  b. The \u201cshaggy dog\u201d remark by Dermott (p. 5) self-labels the landing episode a comedy: \u201cHe was beginning to feel like a character in a shaggy dog story.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThese elements\u2014slapstick confusion, playful miscommunication, absurd anti-climax, and absence of malicious intent\u2014characterize the story\u2019s tone as humorous. The narrative invites the reader to laugh at universal misunderstanding, not bewail human folly. \u201cCynical\u201d misconstrues both the author\u2019s intent and the conventions of farce displayed.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Cynical\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Humor through Incompetence, Not Satire of Vice  \n  a. Slapstick vs. Satire: Debater_B reads human error as cynicism, but the text presents these errors as comical misunderstandings. <quote>and skidded desperately across the field</quote> (p.1) evokes Keystone Kops, not biting social commentary. Their bumbling is a humorous foil to the alien\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9, not a lesson in human depravity.  \n  b. Inordinate emphasis on sleep: Six days of unbroken sleep (p.7) and yawns (p.8) are absurd comedic tropes, not symbols of human neglect. If this were satire, the author would dramatize negative consequences of delayed diplomacy; instead the world merely frets and laughs.\n\n2. The Alien\u2019s Inertia Undercuts \u201cContempt\u201d Reading  \n  a. Collector of specimens: A zoological collector delights in simple curiosities (dog, cat, mouse), reminiscent of a tourist\u2019s souvenirs, not a condescending overlord. His offers to share the helmet (p.4\u20135) signal benevolent play, not manipulative probing.  \n  b. Final horse plea: He \u201cmust blast off immediately,\u201d yet pauses mid-boarding to wistfully ask about riding horses (p.12), displaying longing, not scorn. A cynical envoy would exploit or destroy; here, he regrets leaving without his \u201cfavorite\u201d Earth novelty.\n\n3. Absence of Negative Aftermath  \n  a. No societal collapse or moral lesson follows. The story ends on his departure and Earth\u2019s puzzled silence. A cynical tale would close with ruin or caution; here, no character laments or learns a grim lesson.  \n  b. The \u201cshaggy dog story\u201d comment by Dermott (p.5) self-identifies the episode as an intentionally long, pointless tale with a trivial punch line\u2014classic humor form.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. \u201cQuarantined planet\u201d remark is biological caution, not moral condemnation. Zoologists quarantine specimens, not exterminate worlds. His refusal acknowledges protocol, not disgust.  \n  b. The alien\u2019s \u201cprofanity\u201d (p.7) is a comic mishap from language-acquisition, not evidence of malicious will. He \u201crolled over and went back to sleep,\u201d showing no agenda.  \n  c. U.N. and government \u201cchaos\u201d is global anticipation, not doomed despair. Delegates \u201ccheering\u201d (p.11) await his words with excitement\u2014this communal eagerness supports joyous farce, not critique of institutions.\n\n5. Genre and Authorial Context  \n  a. Mack Reynolds and Kelly Freas were known for lighthearted voyages-the-future stories in If Worlds of Science Fiction. Stylized physical comedy and linguistic gags fit magazine\u2019s tradition of \u201cfun\u201d space yarns.  \n  b. Illustration of \u201cweird egg-shaped vessel\u201d and \u201chorse for centuries\u201d (p.12) aligns with humorous \u201cEarth as oddity\u201d inversion, a recurrent science-fiction trope used to entertain by reversing roles.\n\n6. Interpretation of \u201cCrisis\u201d Scenes as Comic Anti-Climax  \n  a. The \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d (p.9) peaks only to fizzle upon his revelation of trivial motives. Anti-climax is a comedic device; puzzles and hysteria yield to an inconsequential return home.  \n  b. His return \u201churriedly\u201d yet still retains his mouse and wishes for a horse\u2014his single-minded focus on animals signals innocent curiosity rather than disdain.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll principal elements\u2014repeated linguistic gags, physical comedy, anti-climactic revelations, sheepish turfing of \u201cfirst contact,\u201d and lack of dark fallout\u2014consistently evoke humor. Debater_B mistakes playful confusion for cynical social critique. The \u201cshaggy dog\u201d structure, whimsical animal collector\u2019s mission, and laughter at mutual misunderstandings affirm that the story\u2019s tone is \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for a Cynical Tone (Debater_B \u2013 Rebuttal and Development)\n\n1. \u201cHumorous\u201d Elements Serve Satire, Not Pure Comedy  \n  \u2022 Repeated gags (kerit helmet, brogue) highlight humanity\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 and the fragility of authority rather than innocuous amusement. A truly lighthearted farce would end in mutual goodwill. Here, the alien\u2019s \u201cFaith, an\u2019 why not?\u201d and yawning interruptions (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026and went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>) mock Earthlings\u2019 frantic politicking (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhite House, Pentagon\u2026tried to figure out just what to do with him.\u201d</invalid_quote>) rather than fostering cooperation.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cshaggy dog story\u201d remark by Dermott (<quote> He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n</quote>) is itself a cynical authorial nod: a shaggy dog tale is one that leads to an anti-climactic or pointless punch line, underlining the story\u2019s theme of human futility.\n\n2. Pervasive Human Incompetence and Self-Interest  \n  \u2022 Patrolmen misidentify, threaten (<quote>loosened his .38 in</quote>), and later manipulate the alien for political gain. They cordon him off, debate jurisdiction, and only relent to U.N. pressure (<quote>strong and had too much public opinion behind them to be ignored.</quote>). This is not innocent befuddlement but calculated containment.  \n  \u2022 The world\u2019s \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d (<quote> Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. </quote>) and debates over \u201cmessage content\u201d reveal fear of truth, not curiosity or hospitality. Their relief when he is \u201conly\u201d a specimen collector (<quote>I should have been a-knowin' something was queer. All</quote>) underscores their self-interest: they seek advantage, not knowledge.\n\n3. Alien\u2019s Contempt and Final Rejection  \n  \u2022 At the U.N. the alien brands Earth \u201cbenighted,\u201d \u201cquarantined,\u201d and unfit for the Galactic League (<quote>You don't mean to tell me this planet isn't after bein' a member</quote> \u201cIf I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet, my name'd be nork.\u201d). His disgust is not comedic bewilderment but moral indictment.  \n  \u2022 He \u201cscuttles\u201d home with only animals, abandoning humans despite their pleas for guidance. No reconciliation or improved understanding occurs. Cynicism implies distrust of positive human change; here, the alien\u2019s departure confirms that contact only confirms humanity\u2019s failings.\n\n4. Satire of Political Institutions  \n  \u2022 Military and diplomatic players jockey for power over the alien\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cLet me know when the governor arrives; otherwise, nobody gets through!\u201d</invalid_quote>). Their concern is jurisdiction, press control, and propaganda\u2014classic targets of cynicism.  \n  \u2022 The story presents warplanes and weapons overhead at a historic event and yet no defensive or cooperative use of them; they symbolize paranoia, not security.\n\n5. Absence of Harmonious Resolution  \n  \u2022 A humorous story would likely end in mutual learning or friendship. Instead, this tale closes on tragicomic note: the alien laments his folly but chooses to leave humans in ignorance. His final horse query (<quote>now, were they pullin' my leg</quote>) evokes sympathy for the alien, not the humans, reinforcing their unworthiness.  \n  \u2022 No sequel or promised return; humanity remains \u201cbenighted.\u201d The open-ended departure deepens irony.\n\n6. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings  \n  \u2022 \u201cAnti-climax\u201d is the very mark of a cynical satire: it denies wish-fulfillment. Debater_A\u2019s claim that everyone \u201claughs\u201d ignores repeated descriptions of \u201calarm\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Yawns and sleep are not innocence but disdain\u2014he sleeps through days of frenzied politicking. He mocks the \u201cmost important moment in the history of the human race\u201d (<quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>) by being uninterested.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cfarcical\u201d accents only occur under duress of the helmet; they illustrate how humanity\u2019s crude technology distorts communication, emblematic of their overall inadequacy.\n\nConclusion  \nThis narrative aligns with cynical and satirical science fiction traditions (e.g., Swiftian, Vonnegut) that expose human follies through extraterrestrial visitors. Every gag and every human reaction underscores distrust of human institutions and highlights selfishness, incompetence, and ignorance. The story\u2019s persistent anti-climax, the alien\u2019s moral condemnation, and his ultimate rejection of Earth confirm that the correct tone is \u201cCynical,\u201d not merely \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
