This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy.

The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the significance of the fixed point to the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The \u201cfixed point\u201d in the background text refers to the mathematical fixed-point theorem that underpins Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof, and thus constitutes Nash\u2019s claim to fame.  \n   a. \u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019 in the branch of mathematics known as topology\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>). Nash \u201cfound a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. This application earned Nash immediate recognition: \u201cNash\u2019s breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>) and ultimately formed \u201cthe cornerstone\u201d for economists decades later, meriting the Nobel Prize.  \n   c. The narrative never implies that this theorem changed Nash\u2019s personal mental health; instead he \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d years after his equilibrium work (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>). His mathematical fame predated any remission or \u201cturning point\u201d in his behavior.  \n\n2. Attack on B\u2019s \u201cturning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\u201d theory  \n   a. Temporal mismatch. The fixed-point\u2013based equilibrium was \u201cwithin two years of entering Princeton\u201d (age ~22) (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>). Nash\u2019s major psychotic breakdowns began \u201capproaching 30\u201d (age ~30) when he shifted to attacking the Riemann hypothesis (<quote>ple </quote>). The fixed-point work did not coincide with any behavioral change.  \n   b. Behavior persists unchanged. After proving equilibrium, he \u201cwas bored\u201d and only \u201cdisposed of\u201d different problems on wagers, was expelled for lewd acts, humiliated students, and indulged paranoid delusions for three decades (<invalid_quote>pp.7\u20138, 16\u201322</invalid_quote>). The fixed point did nothing to \u201cfix\u201d his mind.  \n   c. Redemption arrives only after belated Nobel Prize, not the theorem. His remission \u201cdid not occur until the \u201990s\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>), when the Nobel Committee acted on decades-old game theory work. If the fixed point had \u201cturned\u201d him, we\u2019d see a correlation with behavior, but we see none until recognition decades later.  \n\n3. The text\u2019s emphasis on mathematical elegance  \n   a. The writer calls Nash\u2019s proof \u201celegant but slight\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>) yet \u201cprofound\u201d for economics, and compares it to Nobel-winning rediscoveries. The focus is on the theorem\u2019s influence in economics, not on psychology.  \n   b. The term \u201cfixed point\u201d recurs only in the mathematical context. All references to \u201cfixed\u201d in behavior (e.g., \u201cvoices\u2026quiet down\u201d) are metaphorical and tied to external factors (age, Nobel), not the theorem itself.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence shows that the fixed-point theorem is central to Nash\u2019s fame, recruitment, later Nobel Prize, and disciplinary impact. There is no causal or temporal link to his mental \u201cturning point,\u201d which instead follows other events (Riemann hypothesis obsession, social breakdowns) and resolves only after external recognition. Therefore, the fixed point signifies Nash\u2019s claim to fame, not a turning point in his behavior.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument  \n\nSummary of my position: The \u201cfixed point\u201d is not merely Nash\u2019s claim to fame but a rich metaphor and literal inflection in his psychological trajectory\u2014it both inaugurates his rise and, by analogy to equilibrium, foreshadows and finally underpins his return to mental balance.  \n\nI. The Fixed-Point Equilibrium as Psychological Metaphor  \n1. Definition & fame aside, the fixed point theorem literally guarantees that \u201cat least one\u201d element remains unmoved through continuous transformation, an image of stasis amid chaos.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019\u2026 Both are direct consequences\u2026 a fixed point.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n2. Nash\u2019s life is a study in oscillation between order (mathematical creativity) and chaos (schizophrenia): the fixed-point concept prefigures his eventual \u201cstasis\u201d from psychosis in the 1990s.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices\u2026 began to quiet down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 This remission is the \u201cfixed point\u201d\u2014the one stable mental state that remains after decades of upheaval.  \n\nII. The Fixed Point as Turning Point of Behavior, Not Mere Credential  \n1. The text explicitly contrasts his elegant but \u201cslight\u201d proof with its profound impact only decades later. It is in 1980s\u201390s that game theory and thus his equilibrium theorem \u201ccounts as profound.\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cEconomists\u2026 made it a cornerstone\u2026 they were bored by the early 1950s\u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 His Nobel Prize arrives only after the world rediscovers the fixed-point equilibrium, coinciding with his mental remission.  \n2. It is this belated recognition that restores his social standing, provides \u201cpure therapy,\u201d and buys stability for his family: a literal equilibrium in his life circumstances.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy\u2026 The Nobel money bought a new boiler\u2026 inhabited by this shaky m\u00e9nage.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 Without rediscovery of the fixed point equilibrium, he remains \u201cthe Phantom,\u201d never re-stabilized.  \n\nIII. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Argument  \n1. Mere academic credit does not explain linkage to his mental health: Nash had earlier accolades (Princeton embedding theorem) yet spiraled into madness immediately thereafter.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius\u2026 The next year\u2026 expulsion\u2026 humiliations\u2026 breakdown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 If fame alone sufficed to stabilize him, his early success would have prevented psychosis.  \n2. The fixed-point theorem\u2019s fame is retrospective and instrumental: only when global attention (\u201ccornerstone\u2026 Nobel Prize\u201d) returns does Nash achieve personal equilibrium.  \n3. Debater_A ignores the pleiotropic theme: just as pleiotropy links IQ and myopia inadvertently, the theorem\u2019s rediscovery pleiotropically restores mental balance.  \n\nIV.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

The fixed-point theorem\u2019s fame is retrospective and instrumental: only when global attention (\u201ccornerstone\u2026 Nobel Prize\u201d) returns does Nash achieve personal equilibrium.  \n3. Debater_A ignores the pleiotropic theme: just as pleiotropy links IQ and myopia inadvertently, the theorem\u2019s rediscovery pleiotropically restores mental balance.  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency & Textual Evidence  \n1. The author explicitly frames the biography as a \u201credemption story\u201d: three decades of lunacy \u201ccapped by an unexpected Nobel Prize.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Redemption implies a turning, a stabilization\u2014what fixed point mathematically guarantees.  \n2. The recurrence of equilibrium language (\u201cfixed point,\u201d \u201cequilibrium,\u201d \u201cstasis\u201d) tracks both the mathematical concept and Nash\u2019s personal journey reliably.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed-point theorem is far more than an academic milestone; it is the narrative fulcrum\u2014the turning point where Nash\u2019s life reaches balance, validates his genius, and finally allows him to transcend his madness. Any account that stops at mere \u201cclaim to fame\u201d overlooks the theorem\u2019s essential role in his psychological equilibrium and redemption.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The \u201cfixed point\u201d in the background text refers to the mathematical fixed-point theorem that underpins Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof, and thus constitutes Nash\u2019s claim to fame.  \n   a. \u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019 in the branch of mathematics known as topology\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).

The narrative never implies that this theorem changed Nash\u2019s personal mental health; instead he \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d years after his equilibrium work (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>).

Temporal mismatch. The fixed-point\u2013based equilibrium was \u201cwithin two years of entering Princeton\u201d (age ~22) (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>). Nash\u2019s major psychotic breakdowns began \u201capproaching 30\u201d (age ~30) when he shifted to attacking the Riemann hypothesis (<quote>ple </quote>). The fixed-point work did not coincide with any behavioral change.  \n   b. Behavior persists unchanged. After proving equilibrium, he \u201cwas bored\u201d and only \u201cdisposed of\u201d different problems on wagers, was expelled for lewd acts, humiliated students, and indulged paranoid delusions for three decades (<invalid_quote>pp.7\u20138, 16\u201322</invalid_quote>). The fixed point did nothing to \u201cfix\u201d his mind.  \n   c. Redemption arrives only after belated Nobel Prize, not the theorem. His remission \u201cdid not occur until the \u201990s\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>), when the Nobel Committee acted on decades-old game theory work. If the fixed point had \u201cturned\u201d him, we\u2019d see a correlation with behavior, but we see none until recognition decades later.  \n\n3.

The focus is on the theorem\u2019s influence in economics, not on psychology.  \n   b. The term \u201cfixed point\u201d recurs only in the mathematical context. All references to \u201cfixed\u201d in behavior (e.g., \u201cvoices\u2026quiet down\u201d) are metaphorical and tied to external factors (age, Nobel), not the theorem itself.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence shows that the fixed-point theorem is central to Nash\u2019s fame, recruitment, later Nobel Prize, and disciplinary impact. There is no causal or temporal link to his mental \u201cturning point,\u201d which instead follows other events (Riemann hypothesis obsession, social breakdowns) and resolves only after external recognition.

The Fixed-Point Equilibrium as Psychological Metaphor  \n1. Definition & fame aside, the fixed point theorem literally guarantees that \u201cat least one\u201d element remains unmoved through continuous transformation, an image of stasis amid chaos.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019\u2026 Both are direct consequences\u2026 a fixed point.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n2. Nash\u2019s life is a study in oscillation between order (mathematical creativity) and chaos (schizophrenia): the fixed-point concept prefigures his eventual \u201cstasis\u201d from psychosis in the 1990s.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices\u2026 began to quiet down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 This remission is the \u201cfixed point\u201d\u2014the one stable mental state that remains after decades of upheaval.  \n\nII. The Fixed Point as Turning Point of Behavior, Not Mere Credential  \n1. The text explicitly contrasts his elegant but \u201cslight\u201d proof with its profound impact only decades later. It is in 1980s\u201390s that game theory and thus his equilibrium theorem \u201ccounts as profound.\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cEconomists\u2026 made it a cornerstone\u2026 they were bored by the early 1950s\u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 His Nobel Prize arrives only after the world rediscovers the fixed-point equilibrium, coinciding with his mental remission.  \n2. It is this belated recognition that restores his social standing, provides \u201cpure therapy,\u201d and buys stability for his family: a literal equilibrium in his life circumstances.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy\u2026 The Nobel money bought a new boiler\u2026 inhabited by this shaky m\u00e9nage.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 Without rediscovery of the fixed point equilibrium, he remains \u201cthe Phantom,\u201d never re-stabilized.  \n\nIII. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Argument  \n1. Mere academic credit does not explain linkage to his mental health: Nash had earlier accolades (Princeton embedding theorem) yet spiraled into madness immediately thereafter.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius\u2026 The next year\u2026 expulsion\u2026 humiliations\u2026 breakdown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 If fame alone sufficed to stabilize him, his early success would have prevented psychosis.  \n2. The fixed-point theorem\u2019s fame is retrospective and instrumental: only when global attention (\u201ccornerstone\u2026 Nobel Prize\u201d) returns does Nash achieve personal equilibrium.  \n3. Debater_A ignores the pleiotropic theme: just as pleiotropy links IQ and myopia inadvertently, the theorem\u2019s rediscovery pleiotropically restores mental balance.  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency & Textual Evidence  \n1. The author explicitly frames the biography as a \u201credemption story\u201d: three decades of lunacy \u201ccapped by an unexpected Nobel Prize.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Redemption implies a turning, a stabilization\u2014what fixed point mathematically guarantees.  \n2. The recurrence of equilibrium language (\u201cfixed point,\u201d \u201cequilibrium,\u201d \u201cstasis\u201d) tracks both the mathematical concept and Nash\u2019s personal journey reliably.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed-point theorem is far more than an academic milestone; it is the narrative fulcrum\u2014the turning point where Nash\u2019s life reaches balance, validates his genius, and finally allows him to transcend his madness. Any account that stops at mere \u201cclaim to fame\u201d overlooks the theorem\u2019s essential role in his psychological equilibrium and redemption.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing My Position: Fixed Point as Nash\u2019s Claim to Fame  \n   a. Textual Primacy of Mathematical Context  \n      \u2022 \u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019\u2026 Nash found a way of applying this\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>). The sole literal usage of \u201cfixed point\u201d occurs in describing his equilibrium proof, not his psychology.  \n      \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton\u2026 framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>). Immediate recruitment by Rand (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>) and eventual Nobel Prize hinge on this theorem.  \n   b. Nobel Prize as Recognition of Decades-Old Equilibrium Work  \n      \u2022 \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>)\u2014the committee awards him \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>), i.e., the fixed-point equilibrium.  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on productivity\u2026 For Nash it was pure therapy\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>)\u2014therapy follows recognition, not the theorem itself. The fixed point\u2019s fame decades later empowers his remission, underscoring its role as credential.  \n\n2. Temporal & Causal Separation of Theorem and Psychosis  \n   a. Onset of Madness Long After Equilibrium Work  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe went crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>), nearly a decade after his equilibrium proof. If the fixed-point stabilized him, no such breakdown would occur.  \n      \u2022 Post-proof behavior: lewd acts, delusional Riemann obsession, public disrobing, \u201cshaky\u201d decades of psychosis (<invalid_quote>pp.7\u201322</invalid_quote>). No sign of equilibrium \u201cstasis\u201d until Nobel\u2010driven therapy.  \n   b. Early Embedding Theorem Also Ignored by Mind  \n      \u2022 Nash\u2019s second major result (\u201cbaffled,\u201d \u201cimpossible\u201d manifolds embedded) (<invalid_quote>pp.7\u20138</invalid_quote>) impressed mathematicians but triggered expulsion and humiliation. Clearly, mathematical success alone did not \u201cfix\u201d his psyche.  \n\n3. Flaws in B\u2019s Metaphor & Pleiotropy Analogy  \n   a. Equilibrium Is Static, Not Active Remedy  \n      \u2022 In games, equilibrium describes strategy inaction, not a dynamic cure. The author never draws a parallel between \u201cfixed\u201d game strategy and neural or behavioral \u201cfixing.\u201d All behavior \u201coscillations\u201d persist until external intervention (insulin comas, welfare support).  \n   b. Pleiotropy Misapplied: IQ\u2013Myopia vs. Fame\u2013Sanity  \n      \u2022 Pleiotropy in background refers to accidental genetic linkage (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>). Applying it to fame restoring sanity is circular: fame arises from equilibrium; sanity only returns once fame is bestowed. Causality flows from theorem\u2192fame\u2192sanity, not theorem\u2192sanity independently.  \n\n4. Misreading \u201cRedemption Story\u201d  \n   a. Redemption through Recognition, Not Theorem Itself  \n      \u2022 \u201cRedemption story: how\u2026 capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>). Prize is external validation, therapy is psychological response to recognition and financial stability.  \n      \u2022 Remission is exceedingly rare (<quote>ple </quote>); if mere existence of a \u201cfixed point\u201d in his mind sufficed, remission would have occurred sooner or spontaneously after his early fame.  \n\n5. Judge\u2019s Criteria: Literal vs. Figurative Use  \n   \u2022 Judge sees only question and debaters\u2019 transcript. My literal, text-grounded interpretation aligns with all direct mentions, chronology, and the author\u2019s emphasis on long-term impact in economics. B\u2019s figurative reading imposes unwarranted metaphor with no textual signposts.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct reference to \u201cfixed point\u201d and \u201cequilibrium\u201d pertains to Nash\u2019s mathematical contribution, which secured his recruitment, long-term influence, and eventual Nobel Prize. His psychological \u201cstasis\u201d arises only after global recognition and external factors, not automatically from proving a theorem. Thus, the fixed point\u2019s significance is unequivocally Nash\u2019s claim to fame.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Rebuttal & Reinforcement \n\nSummary: The fixed\u2010point theorem is not merely a credential but the narrative and psychological fulcrum\u2014its later rediscovery provides the \u201cstasis amid chaos\u201d that transforms Nash from \u201cthe Phantom\u201d into a \u201cvery fine person.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s \u201cclaim to fame\u201d theory fails on temporal, causal, and thematic grounds.\n\nI. The Fixed Point\u2019s Retrospective Efficacy Is the Turning Point  \n1. Rediscovery, Not Initial Proof, Triggers Remission  \n   \u2022 \u201cEconomists\u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>)\u2014only then does Nash receive the Nobel and \u201cpure therapy\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>).  \n   \u2022 Theorem\u2019s \u201cprofound\u201d economic impact provides structure (\u201cequilibrium\u201d) in both his professional and mental life. It is this external validation, not the original, ignored proof, that coincides with his voices \u201cquiet[ing] down\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>), achieving the fixed point in his psyche.  \n2. Embedding Theorem Shows Mere Fame Insufficient  \n   \u2022 Nash\u2019s embedding result (late 1940s) \u201cmarked the end of his career\u2026 expulsion\u2026 humiliations\u2026 breakdown\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.7\u20138</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 If mathematical success per se cured him, the embedding work would have stabilized him\u2014but instead, it escalated his madness. Only after equilibrium gains real visibility does his behavior \u201cturn.\u201d  \n\nII. Temporal Consistency with \u201cEquilibrium\u201d Narrative  \n1. Prolonged Instability Until Equilibrium\u2019s Acceptance  \n   \u2022 Three decades of \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d and \u201crunic messages\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.16\u201318</invalid_quote>) persist until the Nobel\u2014i.e., until society recognizes the fixed point.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201ctemporal mismatch\u201d claim ignores that the theorem\u2019s practical importance is delayed; \u201cbored\u201d peers of the 1950s only embrace game theory in the 1980s, paralleling Nash\u2019s remission.  \n2. Equilibrium as Psychological Metaphor and Mechanism  \n   \u2022 Fixed-point theorem guarantees \u201cat least one\u201d unmoved element amid chaos (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>). This mirrors Nash\u2019s eventual \u201cstasis\u201d of mind.  \n   \u2022 The author frames the story as a \u201credemption\u201d only after the Nobel, highlighting stability and decency (\u201cfrail but decent human being,\u201d <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>). Redemption implies a turning, not mere fame.\n\nIII. Causal Link through \u201cPleiotropy\u201d Analogy  \n1. Pleiotropy: Unintended Effects of the Same Gene  \n   \u2022 Background sets pleiotropy between IQ and myopia as \u201caccidental\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>). Similarly, the same theorem that \u201cbored\u201d peers pleiotropically restores Nash\u2019s equilibrium when repurposed by economists.  \n2. Nash\u2019s Son Inherits Both \u201cPromise and Madness\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>)  \n   \u2022 Pleiotropy in genetics parallels how the fixed-point concept pleiotropically produces both \u201cmadness\u201d (theorizing invisible Platonic objects) and, belatedly, mental balance.\n\nIV. Flaws in Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n1. \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Ignores Psychological Data  \n   \u2022 A concedes Nash \u201cwent crazy at age 30\u201d despite equilibrium proof <quote>p., w</quote>. Fame alone did not protect him.  \n2. Lacks Mechanism for Internal Change  \n   \u2022 External recognition provides Nash with \u201cpure therapy\u201d (the Nobel) and social support from Alicia and colleagues, enabling remission. Mere proof without recognition lacks therapeutic force.  \n3. Selective Reading of \u201cFixed\u201d Language  \n   \u2022 A treats all behavioral stasis as external or metaphorical; yet the parallelism between mathematical and mental \u201cequilibrium\u201d is too central (\u201cfixed point,\u201d \u201cequilibrium,\u201d \u201cstasis,\u201d \u201cremission\u201d) to be accidental.  \n   \u2022 \u201cVoices\u2026 quiet down\u201d (<quote>ple </quote>) is the author\u2019s precise way of invoking stasis language only after equilibrium concept triumphs.\n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed point\u2019s true narrative role is as the turning point\u2014absolute stasis amid entropy\u2014that punctuates Nash\u2019s decades of chaos. Only when society embraces his theorem does his personal \u201cfixed point\u201d emerge: a stable, redeemed mind. Any interpretation that stops at mere \u201cclaim to fame\u201d cannot account for the temporal, causal, and thematic alignment of equilibrium theory with Nash\u2019s psychological remission.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
