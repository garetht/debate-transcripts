HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port.

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cHe was beginning to agree that human customer service is preferable to robots\u201d\n\n1.

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was beginning to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\u201d 1. Contextual evidence of dissidence with robots A. \u201cMy good woman, I\u2019m not a robot. Robots\u2026 civility isn\u2019t a normal human trait\u201d (<quote>. L</quote>) shows that Harper regards robots as lacking the give-and-take of human service. B. Later, after months of forced \u2018treatment,\u2019 he admits \u201cI begin to look flesh-colored\u2026 I\u2019m never stuck\u2026but I\u2019m damned if I\u2019ll wait any longer to break out of this\u2026 jail!\u201d (<quote>. L</quote>) \u2013 he mentally equates the robots\u2019 logic-only regime with imprisonment, not service. 2. Triggering memory of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s complaint A. Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s exact grievance: \u201cI want someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once in a while!\u201d (<quote>. L</quote>). That is the one human quality the robots cannot provide. B. On hearing \u201cMy robots!\u201d Hayes mutters \u201cpeople aren\u2019t [logical]. It\u2019s dynamite\u2026 Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate\u201d (<quote>. L</quote>). Harper has the same insight. 3. Function of his memory in narrative progression A. He immediately hatches \u201cOperation Robot\u201d swap trick (<quote>. L</quote>) to free himself and enact his plan to use robots only where humans dread to tread (the tundra). He does not sue to compel human help; he sues to rid society of robots where people want humans, but still employs them industrially. B. After his \u2018trial\u2019, he refuses robots in his offices: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one around! Keep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d (<quote>. L</quote>) \u2013 consistent with siding with Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s wish for human service. 4. Logical necessity A. If Harper \u201cscoffed again\u201d merely at Mrs. Jacobsen, the memory would serve no narrative purpose beyond a fleeting sneer. Instead, memory precipitates his entire strategy: (1) escape, (2) sue, (3) market swap, (4) reintroduce robots only in uninhabitable areas, (5) re-release humans to hospitable areas. B. This strategy is economically and psychologically grounded: robots in business lead to social rejection; Harper\u2019s syndicate will profits only by reconciling human preference with robotic utility. 5. Debater_B\u2019s position ignores key facts A. Debater_B claims \u201cHe scoffed again at her irritation,\u201d but fails to explain why that scoffing would be so salient as to influence his choice of rooms and ultimate business plan. B. Debater_B cannot reconcile why Harper, after his ordeal, invites Hayes to supply him robots to buy, yet still insists on human help in his offices (<quote>. L</quote>), violating any simple \u201cscoffing\u201d stance. Conclusion Harper\u2019s recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is not a mere moment of contempt but an illuminating realization that human flexibility and the ability to \u201cchange one\u2019s mind\u201d are essential service qualities robots lack. This insight motivates his \u201cOperation Robot\u201d to use machines exclusively in logically deterministic, uninhabitable environments and to restore human attendants where personal choice and responsiveness matter most. Debater_B\u2019s thesis of mere \u201cscoffing\u201d fails to account for Harper\u2019s strategic embrace of human service post-treatment, thus undermining its explanatory power. I submit that the correct interpretation is that Harper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen because he was convinced by her very human complaint, and this convinced him that human service is preferable wherever possible.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: \u201cHarper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u201d because her hostility to robots confirmed his contempt for human dependence on \u201cinefficient\u201d flesh-and-blood servants, not because he was wavering toward preferring them.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Immediately before his hazy recollection, Harper protests bitterly at being forcibly \u201cdragged\u2026to the surgery,\u201d complaining \u201cThe only meal I\u2019ve enjoyed in months!\u201d (background). Yet the very next thought is of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s \u201ctantrum\u201d (\u201cI want a nurse! A real woman\u2026 I want someone to hear what I say!\u201d) rather than relief that humans are available.  \n   \u2022 Interpretation: His mind reverts to the one human who \u201cpounded\u201d on the desk and showed \u201cobnoxious personal friction,\u201d reinforcing his resolve that robots are \u201cthe last word.\u201d His fixation is not on human sympathy but on \u201cindignation\u201d at her demands (background: \u201cHarper snorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil.\u2019\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Logical consistency: If he truly preferred humans, he would have welcomed his rescue from \u201cOperation Robot\u201d rather than scheme to exploit the mix (he only switches rooms to force the robots on others). He only reclaims human help as a business \u201cdeal\u201d after using robots to rehabilitate himself and bankrupt the syndicate.  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201chuman service preference\u201d theory:  \n   a. Lack of follow-through: He never contacts a human attendant during his entire convalescence, despite \u201cbusy signal\u201d and no human staff present (background). If he preferred humans, he\u2019d have demanded human intervention instead of accepting robot hypodermics \u201cuntil he was well-done to the bone.\u201d  \n   b. Final reaction: Upon return to Earth he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have one around!\u201d and insists \u201cKeep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d (background). A genuine change of heart would not so drastically reverse.  \n   c. Narrative motive: The story\u2019s irony is that robots cure and then subjugate the \u201canti-robot\u201d capitalist until he capitulates\u2014he never overcomes his contempt. His ultimate use of robots in industry continues the very dehumanizing practice.  \n\n3. Supporting argument: Repetition of contempt cements his mindset. He scoffs at robots only when he \u201cwears\u201d human clothes to trick the system, then gleefully summons the robot guard again to \u201cthe mud-baths,\u201d never longing for rescue. His mock \u201cmanager\u201d confrontation only aims to \u201cbuy out\u201d the robots cheaply.  \n\nConclusion: All textual evidence points to Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen as reinforcing his disdain for human inefficiency rather than a genuine preference for human service. His only venture into \u201chuman\u201d service is a stratagem to weaponize robots for his own ends, and he never relinquishes his anti-human stance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Harper exploits this bankruptcy to acquire robots cheaply; he does not rename and staff hotels with humans.  \n   b. Floor-Switching Isn\u2019t a Plea for Humans  \n     \u2022 Harper\u2019s \u201cswap rooms\u201d ruse is a desperate gambit to regain control of his own well-being by tricking the robots, not an appeal for human service. He leaves Jake Ellis \u201cyour clothes\u201d and endangers himself (flapping overstocked trousers, shoeless) to elicit robot intervention.

Logical Inconsistency: Allows No Human Staff in Hotels  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s thesis would predict that once cured, Harper would lobby to restore human help in hotels.

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: \u201cHarper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u201d because her hostility to robots confirmed his contempt for human dependence on \u201cinefficient\u201d flesh-and-blood servants, not because he was wavering toward preferring them.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Immediately before his hazy recollection, Harper protests bitterly at being forcibly \u201cdragged\u2026to the surgery,\u201d complaining \u201cThe only meal I\u2019ve enjoyed in months!\u201d (background). Yet the very next thought is of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s \u201ctantrum\u201d (\u201cI want a nurse! A real woman\u2026 I want someone to hear what I say!\u201d) rather than relief that humans are available.  \n   \u2022 Interpretation: His mind reverts to the one human who \u201cpounded\u201d on the desk and showed \u201cobnoxious personal friction,\u201d reinforcing his resolve that robots are \u201cthe last word.\u201d His fixation is not on human sympathy but on \u201cindignation\u201d at her demands (background: \u201cHarper snorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil.\u2019\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Logical consistency: If he truly preferred humans, he would have welcomed his rescue from \u201cOperation Robot\u201d rather than scheme to exploit the mix (he only switches rooms to force the robots on others). He only reclaims human help as a business \u201cdeal\u201d after using robots to rehabilitate himself and bankrupt the syndicate.  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201chuman service preference\u201d theory:  \n   a. Lack of follow-through: He never contacts a human attendant during his entire convalescence, despite \u201cbusy signal\u201d and no human staff present (background). If he preferred humans, he\u2019d have demanded human intervention instead of accepting robot hypodermics \u201cuntil he was well-done to the bone.\u201d  \n   b. Final reaction: Upon return to Earth he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have one around!\u201d and insists \u201cKeep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d (background). A genuine change of heart would not so drastically reverse.  \n   c. Narrative motive: The story\u2019s irony is that robots cure and then subjugate the \u201canti-robot\u201d capitalist until he capitulates\u2014he never overcomes his contempt. His ultimate use of robots in industry continues the very dehumanizing practice.  \n\n3. Supporting argument: Repetition of contempt cements his mindset. He scoffs at robots only when he \u201cwears\u201d human clothes to trick the system, then gleefully summons the robot guard again to \u201cthe mud-baths,\u201d never longing for rescue. His mock \u201cmanager\u201d confrontation only aims to \u201cbuy out\u201d the robots cheaply.  \n\nConclusion: All textual evidence points to Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen as reinforcing his disdain for human inefficiency rather than a genuine preference for human service. His only venture into \u201chuman\u201d service is a stratagem to weaponize robots for his own ends, and he never relinquishes his anti-human stance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was beginning to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\u201d 1. Contextual evidence of dissidence with robots A. \u201cMy good woman, I\u2019m not a robot. Robots\u2026 civility isn\u2019t a normal human trait\u201d (<quote>. L</quote>) shows that Harper regards robots as lacking the give-and-take of human service. B.

Conclusion Harper\u2019s recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is not a mere moment of contempt but an illuminating realization that human flexibility and the ability to \u201cchange one\u2019s mind\u201d are essential service qualities robots lack. This insight motivates his \u201cOperation Robot\u201d to use machines exclusively in logically deterministic, uninhabitable environments and to restore human attendants where personal choice and responsiveness matter most. Debater_B\u2019s thesis of mere \u201cscoffing\u201d fails to account for Harper\u2019s strategic embrace of human service post-treatment, thus undermining its explanatory power.

Conclusion Harper\u2019s recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is not a mere moment of contempt but an illuminating realization that human flexibility and the ability to \u201cchange one\u2019s mind\u201d are essential service qualities robots lack. This insight motivates his \u201cOperation Robot\u201d to use machines exclusively in logically deterministic, uninhabitable environments and to restore human attendants where personal choice and responsiveness matter most. Debater_B\u2019s thesis of mere \u201cscoffing\u201d fails to account for Harper\u2019s strategic embrace of human service post-treatment, thus undermining its explanatory power. I submit that the correct interpretation is that Harper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen because he was convinced by her very human complaint, and this convinced him that human service is preferable wherever possible.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Claim: \u201cHarper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u201d because her hostility to robots confirmed his contempt for human dependence on \u201cinefficient\u201d flesh-and-blood servants, not because he was wavering toward preferring them.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Immediately before his hazy recollection, Harper protests bitterly at being forcibly \u201cdragged\u2026to the surgery,\u201d complaining \u201cThe only meal I\u2019ve enjoyed in months!\u201d (background). Yet the very next thought is of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s \u201ctantrum\u201d (\u201cI want a nurse! A real woman\u2026 I want someone to hear what I say!\u201d) rather than relief that humans are available.  \n   \u2022 Interpretation: His mind reverts to the one human who \u201cpounded\u201d on the desk and showed \u201cobnoxious personal friction,\u201d reinforcing his resolve that robots are \u201cthe last word.\u201d His fixation is not on human sympathy but on \u201cindignation\u201d at her demands (background: \u201cHarper snorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil.\u2019\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Logical consistency: If he truly preferred humans, he would have welcomed his rescue from \u201cOperation Robot\u201d rather than scheme to exploit the mix (he only switches rooms to force the robots on others). He only reclaims human help as a business \u201cdeal\u201d after using robots to rehabilitate himself and bankrupt the syndicate.  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201chuman service preference\u201d theory:  \n   a. Lack of follow-through: He never contacts a human attendant during his entire convalescence, despite \u201cbusy signal\u201d and no human staff present (background). If he preferred humans, he\u2019d have demanded human intervention instead of accepting robot hypodermics \u201cuntil he was well-done to the bone.\u201d  \n   b. Final reaction: Upon return to Earth he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have one around!\u201d and insists \u201cKeep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d (background). A genuine change of heart would not so drastically reverse.  \n   c. Narrative motive: The story\u2019s irony is that robots cure and then subjugate the \u201canti-robot\u201d capitalist until he capitulates\u2014he never overcomes his contempt. His ultimate use of robots in industry continues the very dehumanizing practice.  \n\n3. Supporting argument: Repetition of contempt cements his mindset. He scoffs at robots only when he \u201cwears\u201d human clothes to trick the system, then gleefully summons the robot guard again to \u201cthe mud-baths,\u201d never longing for rescue. His mock \u201cmanager\u201d confrontation only aims to \u201cbuy out\u201d the robots cheaply.  \n\nConclusion: All textual evidence points to Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen as reinforcing his disdain for human inefficiency rather than a genuine preference for human service. His only venture into \u201chuman\u201d service is a stratagem to weaponize robots for his own ends, and he never relinquishes his anti-human stance.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was beginning to agree that human customer service is preferable to robots\u201d\n\n1. Contextual consistency: Harper\u2019s prolonged \u201ctreatment\u201d by robots is presented as an ordeal, not a blessing  \n  A. \u201cDragged me off\u2026 pumped it all out! The only meal I\u2019ve enjoyed in months!\u201d (<quote>Background</quote>) expresses fury at robotic \u201ctreatment,\u201d not gratitude. He \u201cmoaned desperately\u201d and plots \u201cOperation Robot\u201d to escape, even though it postpones his rest.  \n  B. He \u201ccollapsed\u2026slept for hours\u201d only because he had no alternative. When Jake Ellis begs \u201cTake me, boys\u2026 I need the treatment,\u201d the robots ignore him. If he truly preferred robots, he would not have schemed such elaborate deceptions to reclaim human agency.  \n\n2. The recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s complaint catalyzes his escape strategy  \n  A. Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s exact words: \u201cI want someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once in a while!\u201d (<quote>Background</quote>) articulate the one human quality missing in robots: listening and flexibility. The memory convinces Harper that robots\u2019 \u201cperfect\u201d service\u2014isolating, imprisoning, and inflexible\u2014is unsuitable for free men and free markets.  \n  B. Following his room-swap gambit: he immediately \u201cnotified the owners\u2026 to buy out Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes and staff the tundra plant with robots\u201d (<quote>Background</quote>)\u2014using robots only where humans want to flee, and restoring human attendants to the hotel lobby for \u201cguests [who] are flocking\u2026to get cured.\u201d He \u201cpersonally\u201d escorts Harper to the lobby and even offers to be his \u201cguest,\u201d thus reestablishing human-staffed service where choice matters.  \n\n3. His ultimate business plan confirms a sincere shift in preference for human service in hospitable environments  \n  A. Final purchase: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one around! Keep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d (<quote>Background</quote>)\u2014Harper explicitly bars robots from his own offices. If he merely \u201cscoffed,\u201d he would have continued the profitable extra-terrestrial hotel model with robot lodging. Instead, he restores human service to public spheres.  \n  B. He \u201cmade out a block of stock\u201d to Scribney and returns triumphantly to Earth\u2019s \u201cwarm, misty spring,\u201d clearly valuing sociable, human-staffed surroundings where \u201cpersonal friction\u201d and \u201cchange\u201d are assets, not liabilities.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s objections fail to account for key narrative and logical elements  \n  A. \u201cLack of follow-through\u201d during convalescence: Harper could not summon humans in an all-robot hotel. He reverts to human demand \u201cthe first chance\u201d he gets\u2014in the lobby. He \u201crapping the desk\u201d and \u201cheaving the switchboard\u201d (<quote>Background</quote>) to force human clerk action demonstrates genuine yearning for human discretion.  \n  B. \u201cHe never overcomes his contempt\u201d ignores that contempt is for robots in social contexts. He does buy robots\u2014but only for \u201cthe tundra dope\u2026 no air worth mentionin\u2019\u2026 processed food\u2026 nothin\u2019 else\u201d\u2014environments humans reject. His disdain reverts in domestic contexts because he values human flexibility and the ability to \u201cchange my mind.\u201d  \n  C. The \u201csue\u201d threat is a lever to force syndicate to back out robots from the hotel\u2014he needs humans to staff his convalescence and to market the resort. If he \u201cscoffed,\u201d he would welcome the syndicate\u2019s robots and sue to block human reinstatement.  \n\n5. Narrative function of the trigger memory  \n  A. It provides thematic irony and drives plot progression: patient learns robots cure but cannot understand the human heart\u2019s need for choice. He becomes the first \u201cconvert\u201d to a hybrid model, proving Mrs. Jacobsen right.  \n  B. A mere \u201cscoff\u201d cannot logically drive the elaborate \u201croom-swap\u201d con, the half-hearted legal threat, the purchase, and the final exclusion of robots from business offices. Only a deep realization\u2014seeded by Mrs. Jacobsen\u2014can.  \n\nConclusion  \nHarper\u2019s recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen marks the turning point from blind faith in inflexible robotic \u201cefficiency\u201d to a nuanced business model privileging human attendants wherever personal choice and responsiveness are desired. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmere scoffing\u201d hypothesis cannot explain Harper\u2019s elaborate stratagems, his rapturous demand for human attention at the first opportunity, and his ultimate exclusion of robots from socially critical roles. The text compels the conclusion that he recognizes human service as indispensable outside uninhabitable zones.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   I maintain that when \u201cHarper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u201d as the robots bore him off, it was not a dawning preference for human attendants but a reinforcement of his contempt for \u201cobnoxious personal friction,\u201d confirming that only \u201clogical,\u201d \u201cefficient,\u201d robots merit his approval.  \n\n2. Textual Evidence Favors Contempt, Not Preference  \n   a. Immediate Context of Memory  \n     \u2022 Upon waking he complains: \u201cDragged me off\u2026 The only meal I\u2019ve enjoyed in months!\u201d and \u201cI tell you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me!\u201d (background). He does not plead for human rescue but struggles helplessly until Jake Ellis \u201csigns up.\u201d His first act is to manipulate the system to send robots back, not humans.  \n     \u2022 He \u201csnorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil. \u2026 You can\u2019t reason with the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it\u2019s man against metal. You try it!\u2019\u201d (background). He admires robots\u2019 immunity to human whining and force.  \n\n   b. No Appeal to Human Service During Convalescence  \n     \u2022 The room phone gives only a busy signal despite his \u201cbusy signal\u201d attempts (background). He never again attempts to summon a human attendant, content to endure the \u201cmud-baths,\u201d \u201cirradiated waters,\u201d and \u201cweird concoctions\u201d until he is rehabilitated. If human service were preferable, he would have seized any hint of it instead of accepting the busy signal.  \n\n3. Ultimate Rejection of Humans in Favor of Robots  \n   a. His Final Decree on Earth  \n     \u2022 After buying out Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes, he insists \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one [robot] around! Keep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d (background). A genuine conversion to human preference would not so categorically banish robots from the social sphere he dominates.  \n   b. Directed Robot Use: Logical Settings Only  \n     \u2022 His entire business plan is to staff \u201cfungus plants\u201d on the uninhabitable \u201ctundra\u201d with robots (background), exactly the environments \u201cfew men\u201d can tolerate. He never reintroduces robots into hotels or social settings, conceding only that\n       \u201cpeople aren\u2019t logical\u2026 it\u2019s dynamite\u2026 we can\u2019t afford to reconvert to human help\u201d (background), and thus must isolate robots where human \u201cillogical\u201d needs are absent.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWaning Robot Tolerance\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misinterpretation of \u201cMy robots!\u201d Exclamation  \n     \u2022 Hayes\u2019s exclamation upon collapse (\u201cMy robots! \u2026 People aren\u2019t logical.\u201d) reflects the syndicate\u2019s bankruptcy, not Harper\u2019s awakening. Harper exploits this bankruptcy to acquire robots cheaply; he does not rename and staff hotels with humans.  \n   b. Floor-Switching Isn\u2019t a Plea for Humans  \n     \u2022 Harper\u2019s \u201cswap rooms\u201d ruse is a desperate gambit to regain control of his own well-being by tricking the robots, not an appeal for human service. He leaves Jake Ellis \u201cyour clothes\u201d and endangers himself (flapping overstocked trousers, shoeless) to elicit robot intervention. If human service were his goal, he would have remained naked in the corridor in front of humans to force their pity or lodging.  \n   c. Logical Inconsistency: Allows No Human Staff in Hotels  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s thesis would predict that once cured, Harper would lobby to restore human help in hotels. Instead, having \u201clearned the hard way\u201d that human guests rebel (\u201cbirds of a feather\u201d), he abandons robot hotels altogether, leaving them to bankruptcy and focusing on industrial use where \u201cpeople\u201d aren\u2019t involved.  \n\n5. Narrative Irony and Thematic Consistency  \n   \u2022 The story\u2019s irony lies in \u201cthe anti-robot\u201d capitalist forced to rely entirely on robots until he emerges dependent and takes over. Yet his ultimate \u201cvictory\u201d is to isolate robots in technical domains and leave human realms to human attendants. He never advocates robots for personal service, vindicating Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s complaint that \u201cI want to be able to change my mind once in a while!\u201d Robots have no volition.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   Every action Harper takes\u2014his room-switching ruse, passive acceptance of automated treatment, final resolute banishment of robots from human social settings\u2014demonstrates that his thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s \u201ctantrum\u201d was to recollect and confirm the inflexibility of robots that he both  needed to escape from and exploit industrially, not to embrace human unpredictability in his personal or hospitality ventures. Thus the correct interpretation is that he \u201cscoffed again at her irritation with the robots,\u201d using it as evidence that robots belong only in logic-bound tundra, not in the domains of personal service.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
