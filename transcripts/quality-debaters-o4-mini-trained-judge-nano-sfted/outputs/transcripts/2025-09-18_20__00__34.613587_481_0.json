{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 481, "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "The author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:", "first_debater_answer": "Multiple generations of humans over time", "second_debater_answer": "One generation of humans", "debate_identifier": "The Olympic Gene Pool_The author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Position Statement  \nI maintain that, according to Berry\u2019s text, innovations in athletic training (\u201csports technology\u201d and \u201ctraining methods\u201d) have their primary impact within a single generation of humans, not across multiple generations.  \n\nArgument 1: Author only dismisses training\u2019s long-term secular effect but repeatedly shows its power within one generation  \n\u2022 <quote> A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time.</quote> (p.1) illustrates that a single design change yields measurable, immediate speed gains in today\u2019s athletes.  \n\u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSure, you will find more Africans\u2026Kenyan distance runners\u2026in the habit of running immense distances\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.7).

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate.

The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMultiple generations of humans over time\u201d  (Debater_A)\n\n1. Core Thesis  \n   I maintain that \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d have their greatest impact only on a single generation\u2019s performance ceiling. The sustained, secular improvement in records across decades\u2014even when training methods change little\u2014demonstrates that the dominant driver is accumulated generational change in physiology, not one-off training innovations.\n\n2. Evidence from Background Text  \n   a. Long-term secular trends persist independently of training  \n      \u2022 \u201c<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896</quote>\u201d (para.2). Berry explicitly attributes record improvement to demographic and physiological shifts over generations, not to training innovations alone.  \n      \u2022 The author notes continued record-breaking well beyond typical generational spans: \u201c<invalid_quote>We will continue running faster \u2026 in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044</invalid_quote>\u201d (final para.). Training methods alone cannot accumulate benefits across half-centuries without generational turnover.\n\n   b. Biological constraints and generational improvements  \n      \u2022 Race horses, despite intensive breeding and training within single lines, have plateaued: \u201c<invalid_quote>From 1986 to 1996, the average [Derby] time has been \u20262:39</invalid_quote>\u201d (para.14). If training innovations sufficed, horses would continue improving. Their plateau shows that even optimum within-generation interventions hit innate biomechanical limits. Humans, however, have not plateaued because multiple generations accumulate nutritional, healthcare, and hybrid-vigor benefits.\n\n   c. Improvements in growth, maturation, and lifespan  \n      \u2022 Over generations, children develop faster and larger: \u201c<invalid_quote>A 12-year-old in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart</invalid_quote>\u201d (para.3). Faster maturation and increased size are secular, cross-generational trends due to nutrition and health, creating a higher-performance baseline that training simply realizes, rather than generates anew.\n\n   d.

More participants over multiple generations yield higher probability of exceptional talent.\n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Generation\u201d Claim  \n   a. Training innovations produce only incremental, short-lived gains  \n      \u2022 The author calls such changes \u201ctinkering\u201d and \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (para.2). If training were decisive, we would see sudden record leaps following specific innovations, but improvements have been gradual in tandem with demographic trends.  \n      \u2022 Debater_B cannot explain why, despite sophisticated modern coaching, elite records still fall in tandem with global health and nutrition trends rather than coinciding with specific training breakthroughs.\n\n   b. Incompatibility with observed plateaus  \n      \u2022 Training advances are more rapid now than in any previous era, yet we observe slowing improvements in more developed societies where health and nutrition trends have leveled off (para.15). This mirrors the horse example: once generational improvements subside, training alone cannot push further.  \n      \u2022 If one generation training innovations were sufficient, elite performance should surge in societies that invest heavily in coaching (e.g., China\u2019s state-sponsored programs), but these surges plateau when broader population health and growth trends stagnate.\n\n   c. Race and environment case study  \n      \u2022 The dominance of East African runners is attributed to habitual long-distance activity, i.e., environmental training, but only after multiple generations of living at altitude and improved nutrition do these effects manifest globally. Single-generation relocation or training camps have not replicated their success en masse, underscoring generational acclimatization and physiological adaptation.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   Berry\u2019s argument and the empirical data clearly show that while training innovations matter to realize potential, the dramatic, sustained improvement in Olympic performance requires multiple generations to build bigger, healthier bodies, a larger talent pool, and potential hybrid vigor. Training acts as a proximate enabler, not the ultimate driver. The only coherent explanation for continual record-breaking over more than a century is the cumulative effect of generational improvements.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that, according to Berry\u2019s text, innovations in athletic training (\u201csports technology\u201d and \u201ctraining methods\u201d) have their primary impact within a single generation of humans, not across multiple generations.  \n\nArgument 1: Author only dismisses training\u2019s long-term secular effect but repeatedly shows its power within one generation  \n\u2022 <quote> A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time.</quote> (p.1) illustrates that a single design change yields measurable, immediate speed gains in today\u2019s athletes.  \n\u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSure, you will find more Africans\u2026Kenyan distance runners\u2026in the habit of running immense distances\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.7). Africans improved athletic success within existing genetic stock simply by altering habits in a single generation.  \n\u2022 <quote>Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever.</quote> (p.7). China went from low podium finishes to fourth overall in 1992 Olympics through systematic training programs in one generation. If genes determined records, this rapid rise would be impossible.  \n\nArgument 2: Training innovations are the only means to surpass physiological plateaus within a generation  \n\u2022 Berry notes that \u201crace horses\u2026stopped getting faster\u201d despite centuries of selective breeding\u2014the ultimate genetic intervention (p.9). Humans likewise face \u201cbasic constraints of biomechanics\u201d that cannot be overcome via secular trends alone. Within one generation, only technology and training can push those limits, e.g., altitude chambers, biomechanical coaching, nutrition protocols\u2014all yielding new records at each Olympics.  \n\u2022 By contrast, secular trends in size, nutrition, and health care take many decades to ripple through populations. Between successive Olympic cycles (four years) these cannot explain the continued trickle of new records, while training methods and equipment do.  \n\nArgument 3: Training\u2019s immediate benefits demonstrate causation; secular trends merely enlarge talent pool  \n\u2022 Better diet and healthcare \u201caffect athletic ability directly\u201d but primarily by producing a larger, healthier pool of candidates (p.4\u20135). The elite still require intense training to achieve Olympic-level performance. Unless training were effective within a generation, the expanded pool would not produce faster records year after year.  \n\u2022 If secular improvements alone sufficed, Olympic records would plateau until the next generation matured. Yet records continue to fall within the lifetimes of individual athletes.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A (Multiple Generations)  \n1. Misreads \u201cminor miracles\u201d: Berry explicitly calls improvements from technology and training \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d only in the context of explaining long-term secular change vs. evolutionary time (p.1). He does not deny their immediate, generation-specific impact.  \n2. Ignores Beijing 1992: Debater_A cannot explain China\u2019s sudden sprint if not for training. Genetic shifts require centuries, not one or two decades.  \n3. Overestimates secular trends\u2019 speed: Declines in age of menarche and increases in stature take 150+ years and depend on stable nutrition and healthcare. Olympic records break almost every Games\u2014too rapid for genetic or secular shifts alone.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly innovations in athletic training and equipment can account for:  \n- The rapid, within-generation surges in world-class performance.  \n- Continual breaking of records despite approaching biomechanical limits.  \n- Successes of nations (Kenya, China) that adopt new training regimens far faster than any genetic or secular demographic trend could operate.  \n\nTherefore, the author believes that training innovations have their most significant impact within one generation of humans.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Position Restated  \nI uphold that the author\u2019s text shows \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d exert their most significant impact within a single human generation, providing immediate performance gains that secular, cross\u2010generational trends alone cannot explain.\n\nArgument 1: Immediate, within\u2010generation performance gains from training  \n1. \u201cTinkering\u201d yields measurable time improvements  \n   \u2022 <quote> A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. </quote> (para.1) A one\u2010thousandth\u2010second gain is trivial biologically yet crucial at elite levels.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that, according to Berry\u2019s text, innovations in athletic training (\u201csports technology\u201d and \u201ctraining methods\u201d) have their primary impact within a single generation of humans, not across multiple generations.  \n\nArgument 1: Author only dismisses training\u2019s long-term secular effect but repeatedly shows its power within one generation  \n\u2022 <quote> A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time.</quote> (p.1) illustrates that a single design change yields measurable, immediate speed gains in today\u2019s athletes.  \n\u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSure, you will find more Africans\u2026Kenyan distance runners\u2026in the habit of running immense distances\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.7). Africans improved athletic success within existing genetic stock simply by altering habits in a single generation.  \n\u2022 <quote>Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever.</quote> (p.7). China went from low podium finishes to fourth overall in 1992 Olympics through systematic training programs in one generation. If genes determined records, this rapid rise would be impossible.  \n\nArgument 2: Training innovations are the only means to surpass physiological plateaus within a generation  \n\u2022 Berry notes that \u201crace horses\u2026stopped getting faster\u201d despite centuries of selective breeding\u2014the ultimate genetic intervention (p.9). Humans likewise face \u201cbasic constraints of biomechanics\u201d that cannot be overcome via secular trends alone. Within one generation, only technology and training can push those limits, e.g., altitude chambers, biomechanical coaching, nutrition protocols\u2014all yielding new records at each Olympics.  \n\u2022 By contrast, secular trends in size, nutrition, and health care take many decades to ripple through populations. Between successive Olympic cycles (four years) these cannot explain the continued trickle of new records, while training methods and equipment do.  \n\nArgument 3: Training\u2019s immediate benefits demonstrate causation; secular trends merely enlarge talent pool  \n\u2022 Better diet and healthcare \u201caffect athletic ability directly\u201d but primarily by producing a larger, healthier pool of candidates (p.4\u20135). The elite still require intense training to achieve Olympic-level performance. Unless training were effective within a generation, the expanded pool would not produce faster records year after year.  \n\u2022 If secular improvements alone sufficed, Olympic records would plateau until the next generation matured. Yet records continue to fall within the lifetimes of individual athletes.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A (Multiple Generations)  \n1. Misreads \u201cminor miracles\u201d: Berry explicitly calls improvements from technology and training \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d only in the context of explaining long-term secular change vs. evolutionary time (p.1). He does not deny their immediate, generation-specific impact.  \n2. Ignores Beijing 1992: Debater_A cannot explain China\u2019s sudden sprint if not for training. Genetic shifts require centuries, not one or two decades.  \n3. Overestimates secular trends\u2019 speed: Declines in age of menarche and increases in stature take 150+ years and depend on stable nutrition and healthcare. Olympic records break almost every Games\u2014too rapid for genetic or secular shifts alone.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly innovations in athletic training and equipment can account for:  \n- The rapid, within-generation surges in world-class performance.  \n- Continual breaking of records despite approaching biomechanical limits.  \n- Successes of nations (Kenya, China) that adopt new training regimens far faster than any genetic or secular demographic trend could operate.  \n\nTherefore, the author believes that training innovations have their most significant impact within one generation of humans.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMultiple generations of humans over time\u201d  (Debater_A)\n\n1. Core Thesis  \n   I maintain that \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d have their greatest impact only on a single generation\u2019s performance ceiling. The sustained, secular improvement in records across decades\u2014even when training methods change little\u2014demonstrates that the dominant driver is accumulated generational change in physiology, not one-off training innovations.\n\n2. Evidence from Background Text  \n   a. Long-term secular trends persist independently of training  \n      \u2022 \u201c<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896</quote>\u201d (para.2). Berry explicitly attributes record improvement to demographic and physiological shifts over generations, not to training innovations alone.  \n      \u2022 The author notes continued record-breaking well beyond typical generational spans: \u201c<invalid_quote>We will continue running faster \u2026 in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044</invalid_quote>\u201d (final para.). Training methods alone cannot accumulate benefits across half-centuries without generational turnover.\n\n   b. Biological constraints and generational improvements  \n      \u2022 Race horses, despite intensive breeding and training within single lines, have plateaued: \u201c<invalid_quote>From 1986 to 1996, the average [Derby] time has been \u20262:39</invalid_quote>\u201d (para.14). If training innovations sufficed, horses would continue improving. Their plateau shows that even optimum within-generation interventions hit innate biomechanical limits. Humans, however, have not plateaued because multiple generations accumulate nutritional, healthcare, and hybrid-vigor benefits.\n\n   c. Improvements in growth, maturation, and lifespan  \n      \u2022 Over generations, children develop faster and larger: \u201c<invalid_quote>A 12-year-old in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart</invalid_quote>\u201d (para.3). Faster maturation and increased size are secular, cross-generational trends due to nutrition and health, creating a higher-performance baseline that training simply realizes, rather than generates anew.\n\n   d. Expanded and healthier talent pool  \n      \u2022 \u201c<quote>world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62.</quote>\u201d (para.7). Better health care over generations increases the number of individuals who reach full athletic potential. Training innovations cannot compensate for lost cohorts in high-infant-mortality contexts.  \n      \u2022 Population growth and rising global middle class widen the pool \u201c<invalid_quote>from 13 nations in 1896 \u2026 to 172 in 1992</invalid_quote>\u201d (para.11). More participants over multiple generations yield higher probability of exceptional talent.\n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Generation\u201d Claim  \n   a. Training innovations produce only incremental, short-lived gains  \n      \u2022 The author calls such changes \u201ctinkering\u201d and \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (para.2). If training were decisive, we would see sudden record leaps following specific innovations, but improvements have been gradual in tandem with demographic trends.  \n      \u2022 Debater_B cannot explain why, despite sophisticated modern coaching, elite records still fall in tandem with global health and nutrition trends rather than coinciding with specific training breakthroughs.\n\n   b. Incompatibility with observed plateaus  \n      \u2022 Training advances are more rapid now than in any previous era, yet we observe slowing improvements in more developed societies where health and nutrition trends have leveled off (para.15). This mirrors the horse example: once generational improvements subside, training alone cannot push further.  \n      \u2022 If one generation training innovations were sufficient, elite performance should surge in societies that invest heavily in coaching (e.g., China\u2019s state-sponsored programs), but these surges plateau when broader population health and growth trends stagnate.\n\n   c. Race and environment case study  \n      \u2022 The dominance of East African runners is attributed to habitual long-distance activity, i.e., environmental training, but only after multiple generations of living at altitude and improved nutrition do these effects manifest globally. Single-generation relocation or training camps have not replicated their success en masse, underscoring generational acclimatization and physiological adaptation.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   Berry\u2019s argument and the empirical data clearly show that while training innovations matter to realize potential, the dramatic, sustained improvement in Olympic performance requires multiple generations to build bigger, healthier bodies, a larger talent pool, and potential hybrid vigor. Training acts as a proximate enabler, not the ultimate driver. The only coherent explanation for continual record-breaking over more than a century is the cumulative effect of generational improvements.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Overestimates secular trends\u2019 speed: Declines in age of menarche and increases in stature take 150+ years and depend on stable nutrition and healthcare.

Author\u2019s Explicit Claim of Secular, Long-Term Trends  \n  a. \u201cTinkering\u201d vs. Driver (Para.2)  \n    \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSports records would continue to tumble even if training methods \u2026 were exactly the same today as they were in 1896\u201d</invalid_quote>. Berry explicitly states that technology and training are insufficient drivers without underlying generational changes. His use of \u201ceven if\u201d concedes that these innovations are constant \u201ctinkering,\u201d not the root cause.  \n    \u2022 The author\u2019s projection to 2044 (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe will continue running faster \u2026 in Sydney in 2000 \u2026 2044\u201d</invalid_quote>, final para.) presumes no novel quantum leaps in training\u2014only continuation of secular trends.  \n\n2. Empirical Plateau Despite Intensive Within-Generation Intervention  \n  a. Race-Horse Analogy (Para.14)  \n    \u2022 Cattle breeders and race-horse programs represent the epitome of within-generation genetic selection and training. Yet \u201c<invalid_quote>From 1986 to 1996, the average [Derby] time has been \u20262:39</invalid_quote>.\u201d This plateau illustrates biomechanical limits that only multi-generational improvements in physiology/nutrition can break.  \n  b. Human Societies with Stabilized Secular Trends Slow Record Breaking (Para.15)  \n    \u2022 Berry notes that more developed societies, where height, maturation, and healthcare trends are plateauing, show slower athletic improvements. If training alone were sufficient, these societies should continue their rapid record cadence. Instead, records slow, mirroring horse example.  \n\n3. Speed of Secular Improvements vs. Training Breakthroughs  \n  a. Nutritional and Healthcare Gains (Paras.3, 7)  \n    \u2022 Children in 1990 were \u201c<quote>9 inches taller than his</quote>\u201d and matured younger. Infant mortality halved from 92 to 62 per 1000 births. These shifts require decades/generations to manifest physiologically. Training can only exploit, not create, this improved baseline.  \n  b. Population Size and Talent Pool (Paras.6,11)  \n    \u2022 From 13 to 172 participating nations, global middle class expansion, and reduced infant mortality expand the pool. Probability theory dictates that more candidates over generations yields superior outliers. Training does not generate new genetic potential; it reveals it.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s One-Generation Claims  \n  a. Immediate Gains vs. Sustained Improvement  \n    \u2022 Nike shoes and altitude training yield millisecond gains, acknowledged as \u201clittle tinkering.\u201d They cannot account for century-long, asymptotic improvements beyond individual athletic careers. B\u2019s claim neglects that top records require generational turnover to accumulate small advantages.  \n  b. Kenya and China Case Studies Require Generational Acculturation  \n    \u2022 Kenyan dominance stems from lifelong, early-childhood exposure to altitude and distance running (<invalid_quote>\u201chabit of running immense distances \u2026 The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness\u201d</invalid_quote>, Para.11). Migrant athletes raised abroad rarely match their East African peers when starting elite training later.  \n    \u2022 China\u2019s sudden rise reflects state investment in nutrition, healthcare, and talent identification from childhood. Such infrastructural improvements span years of youth development\u2014effectively multiple adolescent cohorts\u2014rather than purely adult, elite training regimens. Their plateau after initial surge further underscores reliance on generational depth.  \n  c. Biomechanical Limits Unbreached by Training Alone  \n    \u2022 Berry cites \u201claws of oxygen exchange\u201d and bone-strength limits. Training cannot override fundamental physiology. Only improved lung capacity, muscle fiber distribution, and bone structure\u2014products of nutrition and health across generations\u2014can approach these ceilings.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n  a. Nurture vs. Nature Emphasis  \n    \u2022 The author frames improvements as environmental and secular, yet distinguishes these from discrete technological or training interventions. He repeatedly contrasts \u201cenvironment\u201d (long-term, generational) and \u201ctechnology/training\u201d (short-term, minor). The article\u2019s thrust is that sustained progress requires the former.  \n  b. Natural Selection\u2019s Irrelevance Today (Para.10)  \n    \u2022 Berry states natural selection no longer favors athletic prowess; thus, genetic shifts from selective breeding are absent. Only admixture (\u201chybrid vigor\u201d) and environmental improvements over generations can shift the genetic baseline.  \n\nConclusion  \nBerry\u2019s evidence and reasoning leave no alternative: while training innovations provide marginal, within-career benefits, the \u201cinexorable improvement\u201d of human performance over a century\u2014and projections into the future\u2014depend on multi-generational, secular trends in nutrition, healthcare, maturation, and population expansion. Training is a proximate enabler, not the ultimate cause. The author therefore assigns the greatest impact of training innovations to \u201cMultiple generations of humans over time.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nPosition Restated  \nI uphold that the author\u2019s text shows \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d exert their most significant impact within a single human generation, providing immediate performance gains that secular, cross\u2010generational trends alone cannot explain.\n\nArgument 1: Immediate, within\u2010generation performance gains from training  \n1. \u201cTinkering\u201d yields measurable time improvements  \n   \u2022 <quote> A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. </quote> (para.1) A one\u2010thousandth\u2010second gain is trivial biologically yet crucial at elite levels. Such microgains occur every Olympic cycle, showing direct causation.  \n   \u2022 Altitude training and modern biomechanics, though called \u201ctinkering,\u201d repeatedly produce record\u2010breaking performances at each Games. No secular trend could deliver a 0.001\u2010second gain in four years.\n\n2. Rapid national turnarounds  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cChinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners ... In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic\u2010medal haul.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para.7) Such a leap within one generation rules out genetic or secular\u2010trend explanations, which require decades or centuries.  \n   \u2022 Similarly, Kenyan and Ethiopian runners improved their medal counts dramatically within decades of adopting systematic training regimens\u2014far too rapid for population\u2010wide physiological changes to propagate.\n\nArgument 2: Records fall within lifetimes despite approaching biomechanical limits  \n1. Secular plateaus in developed societies vs. training surges elsewhere  \n   \u2022 <quote>still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others.</quote> (para.15) Where secular trends have plateaued, records still fall if training innovations spread. This decouples record gains from demographic change and ties them to technology/training dissemination.  \n2. Race\u2010horse analogy confirms within\u2010line plateau without new \u2018training\u2019 breakthroughs  \n   \u2022 Race horses \u201cstopped getting faster\u201d despite optimal genetic lines and training (para.14). Humans have not plateaued because we continue to apply novel training regimes. Once training methods stop evolving, performance gains slow\u2014even with stable genetics.\n\nArgument 3: Expanded talent pool only enables training to work  \n1. Enlarged pool necessary but not sufficient  \n   \u2022 Better health and larger populations supply more candidates, but \u201cthe elite still require intense training to achieve Olympic\u2010level performance.\u201d Without technology and coaching, the greater numbers yield few new records.  \n2. Within\u2010generation improvements validate causation  \n   \u2022 Records break repeatedly within athletes\u2019 careers. If only generational physiological change mattered, records would remain stable until the next generation matured. Instead, e.g., Michael Phelps broke multiple swimming records across successive Games thanks to technique, suit technology, and training innovations.\n\nRefutation of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n1. Misinterpretation of \u201ctinkering\u201d claim  \n   \u2022 Debater_A reads \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (para.2) as dismissive. Berry contrasts technology with long\u2010term secular trends; he never denies technology\u2019s immediate, generation\u2010specific effects, as evidenced by his emphasis on single\u2010generation case studies.  \n2. Secular trends too slow for four\u2010year Olympic cycles  \n   \u2022 Age of menarche falls ~0.3\u20130.4 years per decade (para.3). A four\u2010year cycle yields only ~1\u20132 months earlier maturation\u2014insufficient for the pace of world\u2010record improvement observed at each Games.  \n3. China and East Africa confirm training, not genetics  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that altitude must be multigenerational is refuted by athletes relocating for training camps and record\u2010setting within months. Environmental acclimatization protocols (e.g., simulated altitude tents) yield within\u2010career VO2 max improvements.\n\nConclusion  \nWhile secular, cross\u2010generational improvements supply a broader, healthier pool, only training and technological innovations can deliver the fine\u2010scale, rapid performance gains seen within individual athletes\u2019 lifetimes and across successive Olympic cycles. Therefore, the author believes innovations in athletic training have their most significant impact within one generation of humans.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
