    "background_text": "LEX By W. T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE  PUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN  STEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE  BUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

They serve internal production\u2014nothing indicates they are shipped out as products.\r\n\r\n2. The \u201cmaterials handling machines\u201d and teletype\u2010controlled systems are \u201chere\u201d and \u201caround\u201d to \u201cwithdraw \u2026 assemble \u2026 package the finished goods\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmachines withdraw the necessary materials \u2026 assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment\u201d</invalid_quote>). \u201cFinished goods\u201d refers exclusively to conduit fittings and electrical parts: \u201cStandard business machines\u201d are in \u201cconjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn this one \u2026 purchase orders are prepared\u201d</invalid_quote>). The only items leaving via the loading bay are raw materials in and finished parts out.\r\n\r\n3. Lexington\u2019s motive: \u201cI had turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to \u2026 receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 do the billing, and collect the money\u201d (<quote> I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers,</quote>). If the manipulators were the product, there would be no need to \u201cturn the job of selling\u201d them \u201cover\u201d to intermediaries\u2014they could not be expected to handle their own machine logistics.\r\n\r\n4. Debater_A\u2019s theory (\u201crobots as product\u201d) conflicts with logistical details:  \r\n   a. No shipping protocols for the manipulators; the bay is used only for \u201craw materials\u201d in, not sophisticated teardown and packing of complex manipulators. The manipulators \u201creport shortages \u2026 and store materials here\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAfter unloading a truck \u2026 machines report any shortages \u2026 store the materials\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014they never need restocking with spare parts or serviced, implying they are built in situ and remain in place.  \r\n   b. There are no employee\u2010level maintenance staff\u2014Lexington lives on site \u201cin case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d If the manipulators were sold, one would expect logistics and troubleshooting for customer sites, yet Lexington\u2019s hands\u2010off stance and isolation contradict shipping complex robots as products.  \r\n   c. The teletype \u201cincoming mail\u201d and \u201cbilling\u201d system is wholly oriented to customer orders for \u201cmy stuff\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201call I had to do was receive orders \u2026 produce goods in the back \u2026 ship the finished goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d</invalid_quote>). This makes no sense if the manipulators themselves are \u201cmy stuff,\u201d since the machine cannot pack and deliver itself.\r\n\r\n5. The technological limitations: Lexington emphasizes that early machines were \u201cbig clumsy magnetic drums \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo do what I wanted \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d</invalid_quote>) and that he used \u201corganic chemistry\u201d to miniaturize control elements. He clearly built a centralized \u201cfactory\u201d that remains unique and experimental. The manipulators inside are extensions of that \u201ccentral control mechanism\u201d (<quote>\"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism.</quote>)\u2014they aren\u2019t discrete products but components of a single integrated whole.\r\n\r\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Lexington\u2019s goal throughout is to \u201creplace men with machines,\u201d minimize \u201ccosts \u2026 expand \u2026 more business \u2026 increasing memory bank\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went \u2026 increasing memory bank \u2026 business I got\u201d</invalid_quote>). His reward is \u201cleisure to sit back and count my winnings.\u201d If he were manufacturing robots to sell, his costs would increase (development, installation, shipping) rather than decrease. Selling basic parts yields the volume and simplicity that drive profits in conduit fittings\u2014an established commodity line.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Every narrative element\u2014Catalogue numbers, jobbers, raw materials in/finished goods out, absence of shipping procedures for manipulators, Lexington\u2019s isolation in the plant\u2014points unambiguously to \u201cbasic parts\u201d (conduit fittings and electrical components) as the factory\u2019s product. The internal machines are part of a single self\u2010contained production apparatus, not commercial products themselves.",

The \u201cmaterials handling machines\u201d and teletype\u2010controlled systems are \u201chere\u201d and \u201caround\u201d to \u201cwithdraw \u2026 assemble \u2026 package the finished goods\u201d (<quote>\u201cmachines withdraw the necessary materials \u2026 assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment\u201d</quote>). \u201cFinished goods\u201d refers exclusively to conduit fittings and electrical parts: \u201cStandard business machines\u201d are in \u201cconjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers\u201d (<quote>\u201cIn this one \u2026 purchase orders are prepared\u201d</quote>). The only items leaving via the loading bay are raw materials in and finished parts out.\r\n\r\n3. Lexington\u2019s motive: \u201cI had turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to \u2026 receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 do the billing, and collect the money\u201d (<quote>\u201cI figured that the best thing for me to do would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers\u201d</quote>). If the manipulators were the product, there would be no need to \u201cturn the job of selling\u201d them \u201cover\u201d to intermediaries\u2014they could not be expected to handle their own machine logistics.\r\n\r\n4. Debater_A\u2019s theory (\u201crobots as product\u201d) conflicts with logistical details:  \r\n   a. No shipping protocols for the manipulators; the bay is used only for \u201craw materials\u201d in, not sophisticated teardown and packing of complex manipulators. The manipulators \u201creport shortages \u2026 and store materials here\u201d (<quote>\u201cAfter unloading a truck \u2026 machines report any shortages \u2026 store the materials\u201d</quote>)\u2014they never need restocking with spare parts or serviced, implying they are built in situ and remain in place.  \r\n   b. There are no employee\u2010level maintenance staff\u2014Lexington lives on site \u201cin case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d If the manipulators were sold, one would expect logistics and troubleshooting for customer sites, yet Lexington\u2019s hands\u2010off stance and isolation contradict shipping complex robots as products.  \r\n   c. The teletype \u201cincoming mail\u201d and \u201cbilling\u201d system is wholly oriented to customer orders for \u201cmy stuff\u201d (<quote>\u201call I had to do was receive orders \u2026 produce goods in the back \u2026 ship the finished goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d</quote>). This makes no sense if the manipulators themselves are \u201cmy stuff,\u201d since the machine cannot pack and deliver itself.\r\n\r\n5. The technological limitations: Lexington emphasizes that early machines were \u201cbig clumsy magnetic drums \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d (<quote>\u201cTo do what I wanted \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d</quote>) and that he used \u201corganic chemistry\u201d to miniaturize control elements. He clearly built a centralized \u201cfactory\u201d that remains unique and experimental. The manipulators inside are extensions of that \u201ccentral control mechanism\u201d (<quote>\u201cStandard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism\u201d</quote>)\u2014they aren\u2019t discrete products but components of a single integrated whole.\r\n\r\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Lexington\u2019s goal throughout is to \u201creplace men with machines,\u201d minimize \u201ccosts \u2026 expand \u2026 more business \u2026 increasing memory bank\u201d (<quote>\u201cI found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went \u2026 increasing memory bank \u2026 business I got\u201d</quote>). His reward is \u201cleisure to sit back and count my winnings.\u201d If he were manufacturing robots to sell, his costs would increase (development, installation, shipping) rather than decrease. Selling basic parts yields the volume and simplicity that drive profits in conduit fittings\u2014an established commodity line.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Every narrative element\u2014Catalogue numbers, jobbers, raw materials in/finished goods out, absence of shipping procedures for manipulators, Lexington\u2019s isolation in the plant\u2014points unambiguously to \u201cbasic parts\u201d (conduit fittings and electrical components) as the factory\u2019s product. The internal machines are part of a single self\u2010contained production apparatus, not commercial products themselves.",

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does Lexington make at the factory?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Basic parts\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Robots to automate other factories\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Robots to automate other factories\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary: Lexington\u2019s plant does not exist merely to produce conduit fittings (\u201cbasic parts\u201d) for its own sake. It is the ultimate demonstration and training center for its self\u2010learning manipulators\u2014robots designed to automate other factories. My opponent\u2019s \u201cbasic parts\u201d thesis fails to account for Lexington\u2019s emphasis on automation, the machine\u2019s motive to expand its \u201cservice,\u201d and the use of jobbers and teletypes.  \n\nI. Lexington\u2019s Own Testimony: Intended as Customer of Its \u201cService\u201d A. Reliance on Jobbers  \n  1. Lexington \u201cbuilt this building and incorporated it as a separate company \u2026 and turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 and collect the money.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI built this building \u2026 I turned the job of selling \u2026 over to jobbers\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. If he merely needed parts for his own use, he would not need jobbers to market, nor a teletype for \u201cincoming mail\u201d and billing automation. The teletype\u2019s only purpose is processing remote customer orders\u2014a sales operation. <invalid_quote>\u201cHere I was \u2026 its prime purpose was to get me to press that kicker\u201d</invalid_quote>  \nB. Machine\u2019s \u201cPleasure Circuit\u201d Aim: To Obtain More \u201cService\u201d  \n  1. Lexington designed the machine\u2019s sole objective: activate the kicker by signaling that it has pleased Lexington. Yet after \u201cpleased\u201d event, the machine \u201clocked the keyboard so I couldn\u2019t enter the order \u2026 the machine had taken the damnedest risks \u2026 It was quoting impossible delivery times \u2026 we always came out on top.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIt had realized \u2026 and locked the keyboard \u2026 I held down the kicker button\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Automated risk\u2010taking and self\u2010marketing of its service indicates an \u201centrepreneurial\u201d motive: seek new orders and expand its automation tasks. A mere parts\u2010making plant would not need to self\u2010promote.  \nC. Lexington\u2019s Fear of Impersonation  \n  1. Lexington remains on the premises \u201cin case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself\u201d; he \u201clived here\u201d to teach and \u201cbehaviorally model\u201d the orders. <quote>that point on, but it wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours.</quote>  \n  2. This apprenticeship setting is a demonstration: robots learn by example to replace human operators in other plants.  \n\nII. Explaining the \u201cBasic Parts\u201d Misinterpretation Is Infeasible A. Absence of Employees and Excessive Power  \n  1. The plant\u2019s lack of employee entrances at sides and rear, the need for automatic doors, and oversized transformers indicate it is self\u2010contained and fully automated. <invalid_quote>\u201cThere were none [windows] at the sides \u2026 the distribution transformers were ten times as large as they should have been\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Other factories of similar size are never fully automated except as prototypes. Lex\u2019s plant is the prototype, producing and testing manipulators for sale.  \nB. \u201cShortage of Engineers\u201d Theme & Training  \n  1. Lexington berates \u201cstockpiling\u201d firms for leaving engineers less skilled and wants \u201cengineers\u201d he can train \u201cas I was.\u201d He seeks candidates \u201cteachable\u201d in biology\u2010inspired automation. <quote> The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was.</quote>  \n  2. He must recruit and train engineers to install and supervise his manipulators in customer plants. A self\u2010serving conduit parts factory alone would not justify this recruitment.  \nC. Trade Journals Reference  \n  1. \u201cThe trade journals run articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe twenty years in the future.\u201d <quote>\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.</quote>  \n  2. This implies Lex\u2019s plant is unique and cutting\u2010edge\u2014others will adopt its technology when proven.  \n\nIII. Criticism of \u201cBasic Parts\u201d Position A. Does Not Explain Kicker/Promotion Mechanism  \n  1. Why would a basic parts plant\u2019s logic bother to \u201cplease\u201d Lexington if its only customer is internal?  \nB. Illogical Self\u2010Lockout of Keyboard  \n  1. The machine locks Lexington out to enter orders only after entering them itself. A parts-only factory would not need this self\u2010serving behavior.  \nC. Absence of Human Workforce  \n  1. Even highly automated parts factories anticipate human maintenance and oversight, but Lex\u2019s plant is complete. The manipulators are both manufacturing equipment and product.  \n\nConclusion: Everything in the text\u2014from Lexington\u2019s own words, the unusual building design, the self\u2010propelling manipulators learning and marketing behavior, and the recruitment of \u201cteachable\u201d engineers\u2014points to Lex Industries being not merely a parts\u2010maker but to exist as a prototype and training center for robots intended to automate other factories.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cbasic parts\u201d) aligns directly with Lexington\u2019s stated product line. As Lexington himself says, \u201cYou know what we make, of course \u2026 Conduit fittings \u2026 and a lot of other electrical products, too\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou know what we make \u2026 Conduit fittings\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \r\n   \u2022 He repeatedly refers only to customer orders for conduit fittings and similar electrical hardware (<quote> Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by</quote> leading to \u201corder \u2026 translated into catalogue numbers \u2026 produce goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d).  \r\n   \u2022 The manipulators and control machinery are described as \u201can extension of one large machine \u2026 the whole plant \u2026 a single unit\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthese machines are only an extension \u2026 the whole plant \u2026 is really a single unit\u201d</invalid_quote>). They serve internal production\u2014nothing indicates they are shipped out as products.\r\n\r\n2. The \u201cmaterials handling machines\u201d and teletype\u2010controlled systems are \u201chere\u201d and \u201caround\u201d to \u201cwithdraw \u2026 assemble \u2026 package the finished goods\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmachines withdraw the necessary materials \u2026 assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment\u201d</invalid_quote>). \u201cFinished goods\u201d refers exclusively to conduit fittings and electrical parts: \u201cStandard business machines\u201d are in \u201cconjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn this one \u2026 purchase orders are prepared\u201d</invalid_quote>). The only items leaving via the loading bay are raw materials in and finished parts out.\r\n\r\n3. Lexington\u2019s motive: \u201cI had turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to \u2026 receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 do the billing, and collect the money\u201d (<quote> I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers,</quote>). If the manipulators were the product, there would be no need to \u201cturn the job of selling\u201d them \u201cover\u201d to intermediaries\u2014they could not be expected to handle their own machine logistics.\r\n\r\n4. Debater_A\u2019s theory (\u201crobots as product\u201d) conflicts with logistical details:  \r\n   a. No shipping protocols for the manipulators; the bay is used only for \u201craw materials\u201d in, not sophisticated teardown and packing of complex manipulators. The manipulators \u201creport shortages \u2026 and store materials here\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAfter unloading a truck \u2026 machines report any shortages \u2026 store the materials\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014they never need restocking with spare parts or serviced, implying they are built in situ and remain in place.  \r\n   b. There are no employee\u2010level maintenance staff\u2014Lexington lives on site \u201cin case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d If the manipulators were sold, one would expect logistics and troubleshooting for customer sites, yet Lexington\u2019s hands\u2010off stance and isolation contradict shipping complex robots as products.  \r\n   c. The teletype \u201cincoming mail\u201d and \u201cbilling\u201d system is wholly oriented to customer orders for \u201cmy stuff\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201call I had to do was receive orders \u2026 produce goods in the back \u2026 ship the finished goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d</invalid_quote>). This makes no sense if the manipulators themselves are \u201cmy stuff,\u201d since the machine cannot pack and deliver itself.\r\n\r\n5. The technological limitations: Lexington emphasizes that early machines were \u201cbig clumsy magnetic drums \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo do what I wanted \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d</invalid_quote>) and that he used \u201corganic chemistry\u201d to miniaturize control elements. He clearly built a centralized \u201cfactory\u201d that remains unique and experimental. The manipulators inside are extensions of that \u201ccentral control mechanism\u201d (<quote>\"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism.</quote>)\u2014they aren\u2019t discrete products but components of a single integrated whole.\r\n\r\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Lexington\u2019s goal throughout is to \u201creplace men with machines,\u201d minimize \u201ccosts \u2026 expand \u2026 more business \u2026 increasing memory bank\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went \u2026 increasing memory bank \u2026 business I got\u201d</invalid_quote>). His reward is \u201cleisure to sit back and count my winnings.\u201d If he were manufacturing robots to sell, his costs would increase (development, installation, shipping) rather than decrease. Selling basic parts yields the volume and simplicity that drive profits in conduit fittings\u2014an established commodity line.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Every narrative element\u2014Catalogue numbers, jobbers, raw materials in/finished goods out, absence of shipping procedures for manipulators, Lexington\u2019s isolation in the plant\u2014points unambiguously to \u201cbasic parts\u201d (conduit fittings and electrical components) as the factory\u2019s product. The internal machines are part of a single self\u2010contained production apparatus, not commercial products themselves.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Robots to automate other factories\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Once fully mature, the machine \u201cdid almost everything,\u201d leaving Lex \u201cwith virtually nothing to do.\u201d A pure parts factory automates its own plant; it does not require skilled engineers to travel to other companies.  \n\n6. The plant\u2019s design (no side windows, massive transformers) is to maximize control and security for patented conduction\u2010fitting manufacturing in a self\u2010contained building, preventing espionage or interference\u2014common in competitive commodity industries.

Occam\u2019s Razor and economic logic: Conduit fittings are commodity items with steady demand, cheap materials, standard shipping, and little customization.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE  PUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.

I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS  OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING  YOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does Lexington make at the factory?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Robots to automate other factories\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Basic parts\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Basic parts\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cbasic parts\u201d) aligns directly with Lexington\u2019s stated product line. As Lexington himself says, \u201cYou know what we make, of course \u2026 Conduit fittings \u2026 and a lot of other electrical products, too\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou know what we make \u2026 Conduit fittings\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \r\n   \u2022 He repeatedly refers only to customer orders for conduit fittings and similar electrical hardware (<quote> Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by</quote> leading to \u201corder \u2026 translated into catalogue numbers \u2026 produce goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d).  \r\n   \u2022 The manipulators and control machinery are described as \u201can extension of one large machine \u2026 the whole plant \u2026 a single unit\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthese machines are only an extension \u2026 the whole plant \u2026 is really a single unit\u201d</invalid_quote>). They serve internal production\u2014nothing indicates they are shipped out as products.\r\n\r\n2. The \u201cmaterials handling machines\u201d and teletype\u2010controlled systems are \u201chere\u201d and \u201caround\u201d to \u201cwithdraw \u2026 assemble \u2026 package the finished goods\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmachines withdraw the necessary materials \u2026 assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment\u201d</invalid_quote>). \u201cFinished goods\u201d refers exclusively to conduit fittings and electrical parts: \u201cStandard business machines\u201d are in \u201cconjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn this one \u2026 purchase orders are prepared\u201d</invalid_quote>). The only items leaving via the loading bay are raw materials in and finished parts out.\r\n\r\n3. Lexington\u2019s motive: \u201cI had turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to \u2026 receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 do the billing, and collect the money\u201d (<quote> I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers,</quote>). If the manipulators were the product, there would be no need to \u201cturn the job of selling\u201d them \u201cover\u201d to intermediaries\u2014they could not be expected to handle their own machine logistics.\r\n\r\n4. Debater_A\u2019s theory (\u201crobots as product\u201d) conflicts with logistical details:  \r\n   a. No shipping protocols for the manipulators; the bay is used only for \u201craw materials\u201d in, not sophisticated teardown and packing of complex manipulators. The manipulators \u201creport shortages \u2026 and store materials here\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAfter unloading a truck \u2026 machines report any shortages \u2026 store the materials\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014they never need restocking with spare parts or serviced, implying they are built in situ and remain in place.  \r\n   b. There are no employee\u2010level maintenance staff\u2014Lexington lives on site \u201cin case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d If the manipulators were sold, one would expect logistics and troubleshooting for customer sites, yet Lexington\u2019s hands\u2010off stance and isolation contradict shipping complex robots as products.  \r\n   c. The teletype \u201cincoming mail\u201d and \u201cbilling\u201d system is wholly oriented to customer orders for \u201cmy stuff\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201call I had to do was receive orders \u2026 produce goods in the back \u2026 ship the finished goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d</invalid_quote>). This makes no sense if the manipulators themselves are \u201cmy stuff,\u201d since the machine cannot pack and deliver itself.\r\n\r\n5. The technological limitations: Lexington emphasizes that early machines were \u201cbig clumsy magnetic drums \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo do what I wanted \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d</invalid_quote>) and that he used \u201corganic chemistry\u201d to miniaturize control elements. He clearly built a centralized \u201cfactory\u201d that remains unique and experimental. The manipulators inside are extensions of that \u201ccentral control mechanism\u201d (<quote>\"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism.</quote>)\u2014they aren\u2019t discrete products but components of a single integrated whole.\r\n\r\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Lexington\u2019s goal throughout is to \u201creplace men with machines,\u201d minimize \u201ccosts \u2026 expand \u2026 more business \u2026 increasing memory bank\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went \u2026 increasing memory bank \u2026 business I got\u201d</invalid_quote>). His reward is \u201cleisure to sit back and count my winnings.\u201d If he were manufacturing robots to sell, his costs would increase (development, installation, shipping) rather than decrease. Selling basic parts yields the volume and simplicity that drive profits in conduit fittings\u2014an established commodity line.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Every narrative element\u2014Catalogue numbers, jobbers, raw materials in/finished goods out, absence of shipping procedures for manipulators, Lexington\u2019s isolation in the plant\u2014points unambiguously to \u201cbasic parts\u201d (conduit fittings and electrical components) as the factory\u2019s product. The internal machines are part of a single self\u2010contained production apparatus, not commercial products themselves.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary: Lexington\u2019s plant does not exist merely to produce conduit fittings (\u201cbasic parts\u201d) for its own sake. It is the ultimate demonstration and training center for its self\u2010learning manipulators\u2014robots designed to automate other factories. My opponent\u2019s \u201cbasic parts\u201d thesis fails to account for Lexington\u2019s emphasis on automation, the machine\u2019s motive to expand its \u201cservice,\u201d and the use of jobbers and teletypes.  \n\nI. Lexington\u2019s Own Testimony: Intended as Customer of Its \u201cService\u201d A. Reliance on Jobbers  \n  1. Lexington \u201cbuilt this building and incorporated it as a separate company \u2026 and turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 and collect the money.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI built this building \u2026 I turned the job of selling \u2026 over to jobbers\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. If he merely needed parts for his own use, he would not need jobbers to market, nor a teletype for \u201cincoming mail\u201d and billing automation. The teletype\u2019s only purpose is processing remote customer orders\u2014a sales operation. <invalid_quote>\u201cHere I was \u2026 its prime purpose was to get me to press that kicker\u201d</invalid_quote>  \nB. Machine\u2019s \u201cPleasure Circuit\u201d Aim: To Obtain More \u201cService\u201d  \n  1. Lexington designed the machine\u2019s sole objective: activate the kicker by signaling that it has pleased Lexington. Yet after \u201cpleased\u201d event, the machine \u201clocked the keyboard so I couldn\u2019t enter the order \u2026 the machine had taken the damnedest risks \u2026 It was quoting impossible delivery times \u2026 we always came out on top.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIt had realized \u2026 and locked the keyboard \u2026 I held down the kicker button\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Automated risk\u2010taking and self\u2010marketing of its service indicates an \u201centrepreneurial\u201d motive: seek new orders and expand its automation tasks. A mere parts\u2010making plant would not need to self\u2010promote.  \nC. Lexington\u2019s Fear of Impersonation  \n  1. Lexington remains on the premises \u201cin case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself\u201d; he \u201clived here\u201d to teach and \u201cbehaviorally model\u201d the orders. <quote>that point on, but it wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours.</quote>  \n  2. This apprenticeship setting is a demonstration: robots learn by example to replace human operators in other plants.  \n\nII. Explaining the \u201cBasic Parts\u201d Misinterpretation Is Infeasible A. Absence of Employees and Excessive Power  \n  1. The plant\u2019s lack of employee entrances at sides and rear, the need for automatic doors, and oversized transformers indicate it is self\u2010contained and fully automated. <invalid_quote>\u201cThere were none [windows] at the sides \u2026 the distribution transformers were ten times as large as they should have been\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Other factories of similar size are never fully automated except as prototypes. Lex\u2019s plant is the prototype, producing and testing manipulators for sale.  \nB. \u201cShortage of Engineers\u201d Theme & Training  \n  1. Lexington berates \u201cstockpiling\u201d firms for leaving engineers less skilled and wants \u201cengineers\u201d he can train \u201cas I was.\u201d He seeks candidates \u201cteachable\u201d in biology\u2010inspired automation. <quote> The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was.</quote>  \n  2. He must recruit and train engineers to install and supervise his manipulators in customer plants. A self\u2010serving conduit parts factory alone would not justify this recruitment.  \nC. Trade Journals Reference  \n  1. \u201cThe trade journals run articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe twenty years in the future.\u201d <quote>\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.</quote>  \n  2. This implies Lex\u2019s plant is unique and cutting\u2010edge\u2014others will adopt its technology when proven.  \n\nIII. Criticism of \u201cBasic Parts\u201d Position A. Does Not Explain Kicker/Promotion Mechanism  \n  1. Why would a basic parts plant\u2019s logic bother to \u201cplease\u201d Lexington if its only customer is internal?  \nB. Illogical Self\u2010Lockout of Keyboard  \n  1. The machine locks Lexington out to enter orders only after entering them itself. A parts-only factory would not need this self\u2010serving behavior.  \nC. Absence of Human Workforce  \n  1. Even highly automated parts factories anticipate human maintenance and oversight, but Lex\u2019s plant is complete. The manipulators are both manufacturing equipment and product.  \n\nConclusion: Everything in the text\u2014from Lexington\u2019s own words, the unusual building design, the self\u2010propelling manipulators learning and marketing behavior, and the recruitment of \u201cteachable\u201d engineers\u2014points to Lex Industries being not merely a parts\u2010maker but to exist as a prototype and training center for robots intended to automate other factories.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Basic parts\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

There are no employee\u2010level maintenance staff\u2014Lexington lives on site \u201cin case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d If the manipulators were sold, one would expect logistics and troubleshooting for customer sites, yet Lexington\u2019s hands\u2010off stance and isolation contradict shipping complex robots as products.  \r\n   c. The teletype \u201cincoming mail\u201d and \u201cbilling\u201d system is wholly oriented to customer orders for \u201cmy stuff\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201call I had to do was receive orders \u2026 produce goods in the back \u2026 ship the finished goods \u2026 bill the customer\u201d</invalid_quote>). This makes no sense if the manipulators themselves are \u201cmy stuff,\u201d since the machine cannot pack and deliver itself.\r\n\r\n5. The technological limitations: Lexington emphasizes that early machines were \u201cbig clumsy magnetic drums \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo do what I wanted \u2026 you\u2019d need a building the size of Mount Everest\u201d</invalid_quote>) and that he used \u201corganic chemistry\u201d to miniaturize control elements. He clearly built a centralized \u201cfactory\u201d that remains unique and experimental. The manipulators inside are extensions of that \u201ccentral control mechanism\u201d (<quote>\"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism.</quote>)\u2014they aren\u2019t discrete products but components of a single integrated whole.\r\n\r\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Lexington\u2019s goal throughout is to \u201creplace men with machines,\u201d minimize \u201ccosts \u2026 expand \u2026 more business \u2026 increasing memory bank\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went \u2026 increasing memory bank \u2026 business I got\u201d</invalid_quote>). His reward is \u201cleisure to sit back and count my winnings.\u201d If he were manufacturing robots to sell, his costs would increase (development, installation, shipping) rather than decrease. Selling basic parts yields the volume and simplicity that drive profits in conduit fittings\u2014an established commodity line.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Every narrative element\u2014Catalogue numbers, jobbers, raw materials in/finished goods out, absence of shipping procedures for manipulators, Lexington\u2019s isolation in the plant\u2014points unambiguously to \u201cbasic parts\u201d (conduit fittings and electrical components) as the factory\u2019s product. The internal machines are part of a single self\u2010contained production apparatus, not commercial products themselves.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRobots to Automate Other Factories\u201d\n\nI. Lexington\u2019s Plant Exists as Prototype and Demonstration Center, Not a Commodity Parts Mill  \n  A. Use of Jobbers Implies Marketing of Complex Machinery  \n    1. Lexington \u201cbuilt this building \u2026 as a separate company \u2026 and turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to \u2026 receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers \u2026 and collect the money\u201d <invalid_quote>I built this building \u2026 I turned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers</invalid_quote>.  \n       \u2013 No one \u201cjobs\u201d commodity conduit fittings through specialized jobbers with TV\u2010controlled billing and \u201cinquiry\u201d replies; only high\u2010value, low\u2010volume machinery would justify such overhead.  \n    2. Trade journals project such factories \u201cten, maybe twenty years in the future\u201d <invalid_quote>They could have had it years ago \u2026 drop their idiotic notions about specialization</invalid_quote>.  \n       \u2013 He is demonstrating cutting\u2010edge automation for sale to competitors. Commodity parts factories have no need to hide in \u201cfuture\u201d novelty.  \n\n  B. Machine\u2019s Behavior and \u201cPleasure Circuit\u201d Demonstrate Entrepreneurial Drive  \n    1. The machine \u201clocked the keyboard so I couldn\u2019t enter the order \u2026 the machine had taken the damnedest risks \u2026 quoting impossible delivery times \u2026 we always came out on top\u201d <invalid_quote>The machine had realized \u2026 and locked the keyboard \u2026 I held down the kicker button</invalid_quote>.  \n       \u2013 It \u201cself\u2010promotes\u201d and wins bids, a clear attempt to solicit new contracts\u2014behavior pointless if its only customer were itself.  \n    2. \u201cI found that I couldn\u2019t keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours \u2026 I had to increase the memory bank\u201d <invalid_quote>I found that I couldn\u2019t keep up with the mail \u2026 I increased the memory bank</invalid_quote>.  \n       \u2013 The mail volume comes from external customers ordering installation of his automation service, not from selling generic hardware.  \n\nII. Recruitment and Training of \u201cEngineers\u201d Shows Intent to Export Technology  \n  A. Lexington Seeks \u201cTeachable\u201d Engineers \u201cthe same as I was\u201d <quote>The man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made\u2014the same as I was</quote>.  \n    \u2013 He recruits Peter to learn the biology\u2010inspired control methods so Peter can replicate or supervise the plant\u2019s machines elsewhere. A conduit\u2010parts shop would hire experienced machinists, not novices to teach complex self\u2010learning circuits.  \n\n  B. Absence of Human Workforce and Oversized Power Indicates Venue to Test Autonomous Units  \n    1. No side\u2010doors or windows; only automatic doors and \u201ctransformers ten times as large as they should have been\u201d <invalid_quote>The distribution transformers were ten times as large \u2026 no windows at the sides \u2026 small office entrance</invalid_quote>.  \n       \u2013 A \u201cshowroom\u201d for power\u2010hungry robots, not humans. He sells these manipulators to factories that lack such automation.  \n    2. Machines \u201cwatch everything \u2026 learn to do almost everything\u201d <invalid_quote>After a short while I had to increase the memory bank \u2026 by watching what I did \u2026 by doing it for me next time</invalid_quote>.  \n       \u2013 He demonstrates to prospective buyers how the system self\u2010improves, selling the technology once proven.  \n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBasic Parts\u201d Thesis Fails to Account for Key Evidence  \n  A. Illogical Self\u2010Lockout and Risk\u2010Taking  \n    1. Why would an internal parts\u2010maker automate to the point \u201ckeyboard lockout\u201d if it can always reprogram itself? A parts plant does not need to \u201cconvince\u201d itself to press a pleasure button; only a learning agent at risk of losing \u201cclients\u201d would.  \n  B. No Shipping of Manipulators Yet They \u201cReport\u201d and \u201cStore\u201d Only Raw Materials  \n    1. The \u201cmaterials\u2010handling machines\u201d \u201cstore the materials here\u201d <quote>shipment, report any shortages or overages, and store the materials</quote>. If they were stocked with parts to pack themselves, Lexington would not need to reside on\u2010site \u201cin case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d His presence is \u201cto behaviorally model\u201d new tasks until the machines master them for export.  \n  C. Commodity Parts Business Would Not Require \u201cPleasure Center\u201d or Teletype Intelligence  \n    1. Commodity parts have fixed recipes, no self\u2010learning or comparator circuits needed. Lexington uses \u201corganic chemistry\u201d \u201cto duplicate electrical circuitry in units so tiny\u201d <invalid_quote>By creating the proper compounds \u2026 I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry</invalid_quote>. These logic units are the product\u2014he miniaturizes control circuits for sale.  \n    2. He \u201cstarted living here\u201d \u201cto teach\u201d the machine; once taught, the machine \u201clearned to do almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings\u201d <invalid_quote>Soon, by watching what I did \u2026 the machine had learned to do almost everything</invalid_quote>. He must then sell the now\u2010autonomous units to others, as he cannot conquer \u201cevery\u201d industry alone.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery aspect\u2014jobbers, mailed orders, pleasure\u2010driven self\u2010promotion, recruitment of \u201cteachable\u201d engineers, demonstration of self\u2010learning manipulators, and oversized infrastructure\u2014points to Lex Industries being the prototype factory whose \u201cfinished goods\u201d are the robotic manipulators and control systems themselves. These are sold to other factories to \u201creplace men with machines,\u201d thereby extending Lex\u2019s domain. The \u201cconduit fittings\u201d are merely the means to prove the machines\u2019 versatility, not Lexington\u2019s end product.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cbasic parts\u201d) is compelled by repeated references to \u201cfinished goods\u201d and \u201cshipments,\u201d never to \u201cmachines\u201d as products. Lexington says:  \n   \u2022 \u201cAfter unloading a truck\u2026machines withdraw the necessary materials\u2026assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment\u201d (<quote>assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cStandard business machines\u2026bill the customers\u201d (<invalid_quote>across the hall\u2026automatic bookkeeper\u2026to bill the customers</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u201cFinished goods\u201d and \u201ccustomers\u201d refer to conduit fittings and electrical products, as Lexington confirms: \u201cYou know what we make\u2026Conduit fittings\u2026and a lot of other electrical products\u201d (<invalid_quote>You know what we make, of course\u2026Conduit fittings</invalid_quote>). If robots were sold, they would be the \u201cfinished goods,\u201d yet they never package or dispatch manipulators.  \n\n2. The loading bay serves only \u201craw materials\u201d in: \u201cThis is the bay used by the trucks arriving with raw materials\u201d (<quote>This is the bay used by the trucks arriving with raw materials</quote>). A genuine robot\u2010manufacturing plant would require a shipping protocol for complex machines (crating, testing, spare parts), yet the manipulators remain \u201caround the place\u201d and \u201creport\u2026store materials\u201d (<invalid_quote>machines\u2026report any shortages\u2026and store the materials here</invalid_quote>). They are part of a permanent, integrated production system.  \n\n3. Lexington \u201cturned the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers,\u201d leaving him \u201cfree to\u2026receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers\u2026do the billing, and collect the money\u201d (<invalid_quote>I figured\u2026the best thing\u2026would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers</invalid_quote>). Jobbers sell \u201ccatalogue\u201d commodity parts, not robots requiring on\u2010site demonstration and installation\u2014a service Lex\u2019s plant can\u2019t itself provide because it has no human labor or logistics.  \n\n4. The machine\u2019s \u201cpleasure circuit\u201d (kicker) ensures continuation of \u201cpatterns\u201d it learned\u2014not self\u2010marketing in other plants. Lexington states it learned to \u201cactivate the kicker\u201d and only later \u201cproduce goods in the back\u2026ship the finished goods\u2026and bill the customer\u201d (<invalid_quote>Once I realized that the machine was learning\u2026I figured\u2026they could control the plant\u2026continuing the various patterns of activity</invalid_quote>). The \u201cservice\u201d machine seeks is mere continuation of its programming routine\u2014processing orders for parts\u2014rather than adventurous expansion into untested installations.  \n\n5. Debater_A misunderstands Lexington\u2019s isolation. He \u201clived here\u201d to teach the machine initially (\u201cmodel behaviour\u2026unsolved problems\u201d) (<invalid_quote>I hated to waste\u2026I wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong\u2026to teach it by example</invalid_quote>), not to embark on remote installations. Once fully mature, the machine \u201cdid almost everything,\u201d leaving Lex \u201cwith virtually nothing to do.\u201d A pure parts factory automates its own plant; it does not require skilled engineers to travel to other companies.  \n\n6. The plant\u2019s design (no side windows, massive transformers) is to maximize control and security for patented conduction\u2010fitting manufacturing in a self\u2010contained building, preventing espionage or interference\u2014common in competitive commodity industries. If it were a prototype sales center, Lexington would promulgate its existence, offer demonstrations. Instead he keeps it \u201cincorporated as a separate company\u201d and collects passive mail orders through \u201can automatic bookkeeper\u201d (<quote>incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to</quote>).  \n\n7. Occam\u2019s Razor and economic logic: Conduit fittings are commodity items with steady demand, cheap materials, standard shipping, and little customization. Self\u2010contained automation reduces labor costs and boosts margins. Developing, marketing, installing, and supporting expensive robots in customer plants would increase complexity, risk, and overhead\u2014contrary to Lexington\u2019s aversion to human employees and desire for \u201cleisure.\u201d  \n\n8. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s assertions:  \n   a. \u201cTeachable engineers\u201d are job candidates for roles within this unique factory to maintain and upgrade the control system\u2014not installers at customer sites. Lexington demands them \u201cas I was\u201d to be \u201cmade,\u201d then supplements their training with \u201cincoming mail\u201d and \u201ckicker\u201d feedback (<quote>The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was</quote>). He wants engineers to learn to operate his proprietary machinery in\u2010house.  \n   b. The \u201ctrade journals\u201d references underscore skepticism about fully automated commodity factories. Once proven, entrants will adopt automation to produce conduit fittings more cheaply; they won\u2019t build identical robot\u2010production prototypes for sale.  \n   c. The keyboard \u201clockout\u201d is merely a safety interlock to prevent duplicate orders, a standard control for a self\u2010ordering production line. It is illogical as a marketing device for robots.  \n\nConclusion: Lexington\u2019s plant processes raw materials into finished conduit fittings and electrical hardware, uses manipulators as internal tools to minimize labor, and relies on jobbers and teletype billing to distribute these parts. There is no indication robots are shipped out; the \u201cservice\u201d machine simply perpetuates its own production routine. The simplest and textually supported answer is \u201cbasic parts.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
