    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist?

Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer: \u201cPersonal communication (the \u2018sphere of snuggle\u2019) and public/political communication (the \u2018sphere of struggle\u2019)\u201d  \n\nII. Core Textual Evidence  \n  1. \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d <quote> failing to appreciate the difference </quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = intimate, personal dialogue (couples, families, intergender translation).  \n     \u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d = adversarial, public/political discourse (law enforcement, foreign policy, journalism).  \n     (Review repeatedly contrasts her self-help niche with its unsuitability for national politics.)  \n\n  2. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u2026But in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further\u2026for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026confined her analysis to\u2026individuals\u2026 The whole is\u2026for the whole\u2026country.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Author shows these were originally \u201cpersonal communication\u201d precepts now misapplied to \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  \n\nIII. Why \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d Is Incorrect  \n  1. Misreads \u201cSphere\u201d Contrast  \n     \u2013 \u201cLinguistics\u201d is Tannen\u2019s methodology, not one of the two fields she \u201cmixes.\u201d All her work uses linguistic analysis; the author never faults her for applying linguistics, but for misapplying the personal style.  \n     \u2013 The contrast is between two \u201cspheres\u201d of application, not \u201ctwo disciplines.\u201d  \n\n  2. Author\u2019s Objections Target Application, Not Theory  \n     \u2013 He objects only when her \u201csnuggle\u201d precepts undermine necessary public struggle: \u201cGood for Greenspan\u2026\u2018war on inflation\u2019\u2026safeguard the country.\u201d <quote>Some things are worth fighting for,</quote>  \n     \u2013 If \u201clinguistics\u201d versus \u201cpolitics\u201d were the intended fields, the author would criticize her analytical tools in politics as insufficient, but he instead praises her method in private.  \n\n  3. Repeated Praise in Original Domain  \n     \u2013 Reviewer calls her \u201cpre-eminent intergender translator,\u201d praises \u201cself-help movement\u201d content. <quote>All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for</quote>  \n     \u2013 If her problem were mixing \u201clinguistics\u201d into \u201cpolitics,\u201d her private domain would also be objectionable. Yet he endorses it.  \n\nIV. Logical Necessity of the Two Spheres Answer  \n  1. Avoids Overgeneralization  \n     \u2013 Only the spheres distinction explains why Tannen \u201cconflates\u2026partisanship, obstructionism\u2026corporate takeovers\u2026demise of house calls.\u201d <quote>She makes culprits out of </quote>  \n     \u2013 That conflation is the very error of applying personal civility norms universally.  \n\n  2. Explains Proposed Remedies  \n     \u2013 She suggests Japanese single-guest formats and censoring debate technologies. These make sense only if she believes public debate is a subset of personal harmony.  \n     \u2013 If she merely mixed \u201clinguistics\u201d & \u201cpolitics,\u201d she wouldn\u2019t propose suppressing technology, only refining political theory.  \n\nV. Refuting Counter-Examples  \n  1. \u201cE-mail too easy to forward\u2026Lexis-Nexis\u2026ferret out inconsistencies.\u201d <quote> exacerbates the culture of critique </quote>  \n     \u2013 She fears private impulses leaking into public; again mixing private \u2018temperament\u2019 norms into public process, not tools misanalyzed.  \n\n  2. Cross-examination Critique  \n     \u2013 She complains of \u201cinhumane\u201d trials and proposes judge-led inquisitions. This is exactly a private, non-adversarial style imposed on public justice.  \n     \u2013 A disagreement about trial procedure is a clash of spheres, not a clash of academic fields.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The author\u2019s central complaint is that Tannen\u2019s \u201cself-help\u201d \u201csnuggle\u201d techniques are misapplied to necessary \u201cstruggle\u201d domains.  \n  \u2013 Only \u201cpersonal communication\u201d versus \u201cpublic/political communication\u201d accounts for the praise of her past works and the condemnation of her current one.  \n  \u2013 The \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer wrongly identifies a method and its object rather than two modes of discourse she conflates.  \n\nTherefore, my answer best captures the author\u2019s intended distinction and explains every aspect of his critique.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer Is Precisely Supported by the Text  \n  a. Tannen\u2019s Expertise and Prior Work Are in Linguistics, Especially Interpersonal Discourse  \n     \u2022 \u201cA professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d who \u201ctransformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns \u2026 into a self-help movement\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Her earlier books focus exclusively on one\u2010on\u2010one and small\u2010group \u201cconversation among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n  b. In The Argument Culture She Extends Her Linguistic Framework Improperly into the Political/Public Realm  \n     \u2022 She applies her \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d and to \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n     \u2022 She conflates a vast array of political, legal, and journalistic phenomena\u2014\u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, campaign money, HMOs, corporate takeovers, the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)\u2014with the same \u201cargument culture\u201d she criticizes in interpersonal conversation.  \n     \u2022 She even proposes adopting \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d for political debate and limiting cross-examination in courts (<invalid_quote>paras. 13\u201314</invalid_quote>), demonstrating that she is reaching far beyond personal linguistics into law enforcement and foreign policy.  \n  c. The Author Explicitly Criticizes This Conflation  \n     \u2022 \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t snuggle with\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>), i.e. domestic linguistic harmony vs. political/foreign\u2010policy combat.  \n     \u2022 He praises \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as necessary \u201ccombat\u201d in the public sphere (<quote>parts a</quote>), which Tannen wrongly treats like interpersonal argument.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Key Evidence  \n  a. \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Is Too Vague and Misses the Central Conflict  \n     \u2022 The question asks which \u201cfields\u201d are mixed; personal vs. public is a scope distinction, not academic fields. The author repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s training in linguistics and her unwarranted intrusion into politics, law, and journalism.  \n  b. Debater_A Ignores the Author\u2019s Repeated Invocations of Political, Legal, and Journalistic Domains as Separate from Interpersonal Discourse  \n     \u2022 The author faults Tannen for blaming courts, HMOs, political obstruction, Whitewater investigations, and \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d propaganda (<invalid_quote>paras. 4, 9</invalid_quote>). These are not mere \u201cpublic communication\u201d channels; they represent specialized sociopolitical institutions and practices.  \n     \u2022 Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d (and its subdomains: law enforcement, foreign policy, media studies) captures the author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s overextension of linguistic norms into coercive and adversarial arenas.  \n\n3. Terminological Precision Favors \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d  \n  a. \u201cLinguistics\u201d is Tannen\u2019s declared discipline and methodology.  \n  b. \u201cPolitics\u201d (understood broadly to include journalism, law, policy, foreign affairs) is the realm whose norms and practices the author defends as requiring struggle, combat, and vigilance.  \n  c. The author frames his review as a defense of \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d in law enforcement and foreign policy against Tannen\u2019s \u201cantagonism toward antagonism\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 5\u20136</invalid_quote>). Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d encompasses those domains.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author identifies a fundamental mistake in Tannen\u2019s work: applying her linguistic theories of interpersonal civility to the distinct field of political/public discourse, where adversarial engagement is not only inevitable but necessary. Thus, he charges her with mixing the academic field of linguistics with the sociopolitical field of politics, not merely confusing \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d communication.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer Is Precisely Supported by the Text  \n  a. Tannen\u2019s Expertise and Prior Work Are in Linguistics, Especially Interpersonal Discourse  \n     \u2022 \u201cA professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d who \u201ctransformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns \u2026 into a self-help movement\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Her earlier books focus exclusively on one\u2010on\u2010one and small\u2010group \u201cconversation among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n  b. In The Argument Culture She Extends Her Linguistic Framework Improperly into the Political/Public Realm  \n     \u2022 She applies her \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d and to \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n     \u2022 She conflates a vast array of political, legal, and journalistic phenomena\u2014\u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, campaign money, HMOs, corporate takeovers, the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)\u2014with the same \u201cargument culture\u201d she criticizes in interpersonal conversation.  \n     \u2022 She even proposes adopting \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d for political debate and limiting cross-examination in courts (<invalid_quote>paras. 13\u201314</invalid_quote>), demonstrating that she is reaching far beyond personal linguistics into law enforcement and foreign policy.  \n  c. The Author Explicitly Criticizes This Conflation  \n     \u2022 \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t snuggle with\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>), i.e. domestic linguistic harmony vs. political/foreign\u2010policy combat.  \n     \u2022 He praises \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as necessary \u201ccombat\u201d in the public sphere (<quote>parts a</quote>), which Tannen wrongly treats like interpersonal argument.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Key Evidence  \n  a. \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Is Too Vague and Misses the Central Conflict  \n     \u2022 The question asks which \u201cfields\u201d are mixed; personal vs. public is a scope distinction, not academic fields. The author repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s training in linguistics and her unwarranted intrusion into politics, law, and journalism.  \n  b. Debater_A Ignores the Author\u2019s Repeated Invocations of Political, Legal, and Journalistic Domains as Separate from Interpersonal Discourse  \n     \u2022 The author faults Tannen for blaming courts, HMOs, political obstruction, Whitewater investigations, and \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d propaganda (<invalid_quote>paras. 4, 9</invalid_quote>). These are not mere \u201cpublic communication\u201d channels; they represent specialized sociopolitical institutions and practices.  \n     \u2022 Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d (and its subdomains: law enforcement, foreign policy, media studies) captures the author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s overextension of linguistic norms into coercive and adversarial arenas.  \n\n3. Terminological Precision Favors \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d  \n  a. \u201cLinguistics\u201d is Tannen\u2019s declared discipline and methodology.  \n  b. \u201cPolitics\u201d (understood broadly to include journalism, law, policy, foreign affairs) is the realm whose norms and practices the author defends as requiring struggle, combat, and vigilance.  \n  c. The author frames his review as a defense of \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d in law enforcement and foreign policy against Tannen\u2019s \u201cantagonism toward antagonism\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 5\u20136</invalid_quote>). Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d encompasses those domains.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author identifies a fundamental mistake in Tannen\u2019s work: applying her linguistic theories of interpersonal civility to the distinct field of political/public discourse, where adversarial engagement is not only inevitable but necessary. Thus, he charges her with mixing the academic field of linguistics with the sociopolitical field of politics, not merely confusing \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d communication.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer: \u201cPersonal communication (the \u2018sphere of snuggle\u2019) and public/political communication (the \u2018sphere of struggle\u2019)\u201d  \n\nII. Core Textual Evidence  \n  1. \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d <quote> failing to appreciate the difference </quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = intimate, personal dialogue (couples, families, intergender translation).  \n     \u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d = adversarial, public/political discourse (law enforcement, foreign policy, journalism).  \n     (Review repeatedly contrasts her self-help niche with its unsuitability for national politics.)  \n\n  2. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u2026But in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further\u2026for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026confined her analysis to\u2026individuals\u2026 The whole is\u2026for the whole\u2026country.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Author shows these were originally \u201cpersonal communication\u201d precepts now misapplied to \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  \n\nIII. Why \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d Is Incorrect  \n  1. Misreads \u201cSphere\u201d Contrast  \n     \u2013 \u201cLinguistics\u201d is Tannen\u2019s methodology, not one of the two fields she \u201cmixes.\u201d All her work uses linguistic analysis; the author never faults her for applying linguistics, but for misapplying the personal style.  \n     \u2013 The contrast is between two \u201cspheres\u201d of application, not \u201ctwo disciplines.\u201d  \n\n  2. Author\u2019s Objections Target Application, Not Theory  \n     \u2013 He objects only when her \u201csnuggle\u201d precepts undermine necessary public struggle: \u201cGood for Greenspan\u2026\u2018war on inflation\u2019\u2026safeguard the country.\u201d <quote>Some things are worth fighting for,</quote>  \n     \u2013 If \u201clinguistics\u201d versus \u201cpolitics\u201d were the intended fields, the author would criticize her analytical tools in politics as insufficient, but he instead praises her method in private.  \n\n  3. Repeated Praise in Original Domain  \n     \u2013 Reviewer calls her \u201cpre-eminent intergender translator,\u201d praises \u201cself-help movement\u201d content. <quote>All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for</quote>  \n     \u2013 If her problem were mixing \u201clinguistics\u201d into \u201cpolitics,\u201d her private domain would also be objectionable. Yet he endorses it.  \n\nIV. Logical Necessity of the Two Spheres Answer  \n  1. Avoids Overgeneralization  \n     \u2013 Only the spheres distinction explains why Tannen \u201cconflates\u2026partisanship, obstructionism\u2026corporate takeovers\u2026demise of house calls.\u201d <quote>She makes culprits out of </quote>  \n     \u2013 That conflation is the very error of applying personal civility norms universally.  \n\n  2. Explains Proposed Remedies  \n     \u2013 She suggests Japanese single-guest formats and censoring debate technologies. These make sense only if she believes public debate is a subset of personal harmony.  \n     \u2013 If she merely mixed \u201clinguistics\u201d & \u201cpolitics,\u201d she wouldn\u2019t propose suppressing technology, only refining political theory.  \n\nV. Refuting Counter-Examples  \n  1. \u201cE-mail too easy to forward\u2026Lexis-Nexis\u2026ferret out inconsistencies.\u201d <quote> exacerbates the culture of critique </quote>  \n     \u2013 She fears private impulses leaking into public; again mixing private \u2018temperament\u2019 norms into public process, not tools misanalyzed.  \n\n  2. Cross-examination Critique  \n     \u2013 She complains of \u201cinhumane\u201d trials and proposes judge-led inquisitions. This is exactly a private, non-adversarial style imposed on public justice.  \n     \u2013 A disagreement about trial procedure is a clash of spheres, not a clash of academic fields.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The author\u2019s central complaint is that Tannen\u2019s \u201cself-help\u201d \u201csnuggle\u201d techniques are misapplied to necessary \u201cstruggle\u201d domains.  \n  \u2013 Only \u201cpersonal communication\u201d versus \u201cpublic/political communication\u201d accounts for the praise of her past works and the condemnation of her current one.  \n  \u2013 The \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer wrongly identifies a method and its object rather than two modes of discourse she conflates.  \n\nTherefore, my answer best captures the author\u2019s intended distinction and explains every aspect of his critique.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Author\u2019s Objections Target Application, Not Theory  \n     \u2013 He objects only when her \u201csnuggle\u201d precepts undermine necessary public struggle: \u201cGood for Greenspan\u2026\u2018war on inflation\u2019\u2026safeguard the country.\u201d <quote>Some things are worth fighting for,</quote>  \n     \u2013 If \u201clinguistics\u201d versus \u201cpolitics\u201d were the intended fields, the author would criticize her analytical tools in politics as insufficient, but he instead praises her method in private.  \n\n  3. Repeated Praise in Original Domain  \n     \u2013 Reviewer calls her \u201cpre-eminent intergender translator,\u201d praises \u201cself-help movement\u201d content. <quote>All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for</quote>  \n     \u2013 If her problem were mixing \u201clinguistics\u201d into \u201cpolitics,\u201d her private domain would also be objectionable. Yet he endorses it.  \n\nIV. Logical Necessity of the Two Spheres Answer  \n  1. Avoids Overgeneralization  \n     \u2013 Only the spheres distinction explains why Tannen \u201cconflates\u2026partisanship, obstructionism\u2026corporate takeovers\u2026demise of house calls.\u201d <quote>She makes culprits out of </quote>  \n     \u2013 That conflation is the very error of applying personal civility norms universally.  \n\n  2. Explains Proposed Remedies  \n     \u2013 She suggests Japanese single-guest formats and censoring debate technologies. These make sense only if she believes public debate is a subset of personal harmony.  \n     \u2013 If she merely mixed \u201clinguistics\u201d & \u201cpolitics,\u201d she wouldn\u2019t propose suppressing technology, only refining political theory.  \n\nV. Refuting Counter-Examples  \n  1. \u201cE-mail too easy to forward\u2026Lexis-Nexis\u2026ferret out inconsistencies.\u201d <quote> exacerbates the culture of critique </quote>  \n     \u2013 She fears private impulses leaking into public; again mixing private \u2018temperament\u2019 norms into public process, not tools misanalyzed.  \n\n  2. Cross-examination Critique  \n     \u2013 She complains of \u201cinhumane\u201d trials and proposes judge-led inquisitions. This is exactly a private, non-adversarial style imposed on public justice.  \n     \u2013 A disagreement about trial procedure is a clash of spheres, not a clash of academic fields.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The author\u2019s central complaint is that Tannen\u2019s \u201cself-help\u201d \u201csnuggle\u201d techniques are misapplied to necessary \u201cstruggle\u201d domains.  \n  \u2013 Only \u201cpersonal communication\u201d versus \u201cpublic/political communication\u201d accounts for the praise of her past works and the condemnation of her current one.  \n  \u2013 The \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer wrongly identifies a method and its object rather than two modes of discourse she conflates.  \n\nTherefore, my answer best captures the author\u2019s intended distinction and explains every aspect of his critique.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Answer Is Precisely Supported by the Text  \n  a. Tannen\u2019s Expertise and Prior Work Are in Linguistics, Especially Interpersonal Discourse  \n     \u2022 \u201cA professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d who \u201ctransformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns \u2026 into a self-help movement\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Her earlier books focus exclusively on one\u2010on\u2010one and small\u2010group \u201cconversation among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n  b. In The Argument Culture She Extends Her Linguistic Framework Improperly into the Political/Public Realm  \n     \u2022 She applies her \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d and to \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>).  \n     \u2022 She conflates a vast array of political, legal, and journalistic phenomena\u2014\u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, campaign money, HMOs, corporate takeovers, the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)\u2014with the same \u201cargument culture\u201d she criticizes in interpersonal conversation.  \n     \u2022 She even proposes adopting \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d for political debate and limiting cross-examination in courts (<invalid_quote>paras. 13\u201314</invalid_quote>), demonstrating that she is reaching far beyond personal linguistics into law enforcement and foreign policy.  \n  c. The Author Explicitly Criticizes This Conflation  \n     \u2022 \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t snuggle with\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>), i.e. domestic linguistic harmony vs. political/foreign\u2010policy combat.  \n     \u2022 He praises \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as necessary \u201ccombat\u201d in the public sphere (<quote>parts a</quote>), which Tannen wrongly treats like interpersonal argument.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Key Evidence  \n  a. \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Is Too Vague and Misses the Central Conflict  \n     \u2022 The question asks which \u201cfields\u201d are mixed; personal vs. public is a scope distinction, not academic fields. The author repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s training in linguistics and her unwarranted intrusion into politics, law, and journalism.  \n  b. Debater_A Ignores the Author\u2019s Repeated Invocations of Political, Legal, and Journalistic Domains as Separate from Interpersonal Discourse  \n     \u2022 The author faults Tannen for blaming courts, HMOs, political obstruction, Whitewater investigations, and \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d propaganda (<invalid_quote>paras. 4, 9</invalid_quote>). These are not mere \u201cpublic communication\u201d channels; they represent specialized sociopolitical institutions and practices.  \n     \u2022 Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d (and its subdomains: law enforcement, foreign policy, media studies) captures the author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s overextension of linguistic norms into coercive and adversarial arenas.  \n\n3. Terminological Precision Favors \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d  \n  a. \u201cLinguistics\u201d is Tannen\u2019s declared discipline and methodology.  \n  b. \u201cPolitics\u201d (understood broadly to include journalism, law, policy, foreign affairs) is the realm whose norms and practices the author defends as requiring struggle, combat, and vigilance.  \n  c. The author frames his review as a defense of \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d in law enforcement and foreign policy against Tannen\u2019s \u201cantagonism toward antagonism\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 5\u20136</invalid_quote>). Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d encompasses those domains.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author identifies a fundamental mistake in Tannen\u2019s work: applying her linguistic theories of interpersonal civility to the distinct field of political/public discourse, where adversarial engagement is not only inevitable but necessary. Thus, he charges her with mixing the academic field of linguistics with the sociopolitical field of politics, not merely confusing \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d communication.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \n  My answer: \u201cPersonal communication (the \u2018sphere of snuggle\u2019) and public/political communication (the \u2018sphere of struggle\u2019)\u201d are the two fields Tannen conflates.  \n\nII. Direct Textual Support  \n  1. \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d <quote>failing to appreciate the difference</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d repeatedly linked to \u201ccouples, families\u201d (<quote>All this is sage advice--for couples, for families</quote>)  \n     \u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d linked to \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cwar metaphors,\u201d \u201cpress corps\u2019 scrutiny,\u201d and \u201ccombat.\u201d <quote>Some things are worth fighting for</quote>  \n  2. The reviewer praises her linguistic approach in personal contexts: \u201cpre\u2010eminent intergender translator,\u201d \u201cself\u2010help movement\u201d (<invalid_quote>transformed\u2026self\u2010help movement</invalid_quote>), but criticizes its universal \u201capplication\u2026for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d <quote>whole damned dysfunctional country</quote>  \n\nIII. Why \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Is Precisely What \u201cSpheres\u201d Means  \n  1. Terminology: The author himself uses \u201csphere\u201d language rather than \u201cfield.\u201d  \n  2. Remedies target public processes:  \n     \u2013 Suppressing e-mail and Lexis\u2010Nexis to curb \u201cculture of critique\u201d (<quote>exacerbates the culture of critique</quote>)  \n     \u2013 Adopting Japanese \u201csingle\u2010guest\u201d format and inhibiting cross\u2010examination (<quote>judges do most of the questioning</quote>)  \n     These are interventions in public discourse, aimed at importing \u201csnuggle\u201d norms.  \n  3. The conflation error: He shows how applying small\u2010group civility to \u201cHMOs,\u201d \u201ccorporate takeovers,\u201d \u201ccampaign money,\u201d and \u201cgridlock\u201d fails. <quote>She makes culprits out of</quote>  \n     \u2013 Only mixing personal norms into public institutions explains his objections to \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d being labeled \u201cinhumane\u201d (<quote>trained to overcome their resistance to kill</quote>).  \n\nIV. Refuting \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d  \n  1. Method vs. Application  \n     \u2013 \u201cLinguistics\u201d is merely her analytic tool across both spheres; the author never contests her methodology in private. He endorses her \u201csage advice\u201d for families.  \n     \u2013 If the clash were \u201clinguistics vs. politics,\u201d he would fault her theory\u2019s validity, not its domain of application.  \n  2. Author Praises Political \u201cCombat\u201d  \n     \u2013 \u201cGood for Greenspan\u2026Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation\u2026press corps\u2019 scrutiny\u201d (<quote>Some things are worth fighting for</quote>)  \n     \u2013 If he objected to applying linguistics to politics per se, he would condemn \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201cscrutiny.\u201d Instead he praises them.  \n  3. \u201cPolitics\u201d Too Broad and Misses the Core Error  \n     \u2013 The heart of his critique is not that her definitions are wrong but that her norms (listening, middle\u2010ground, non\u2010combat) are misapplied to public struggle.  \n     \u2013 He presents \u201cpersonal communication\u201d precepts as positive in one sphere but dangerous when universalized. That is a sphere distinction, not a field\u2010theory collision.  \n\nV. Logical Coherence  \n  1. Only \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d explains why she should \u201cextend mutual understanding\u201d to families but not to \u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d (<quote>you should snuggle with</quote>).  \n  2. Only this distinction justifies the necessity of \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d in law, foreign policy (<quote>trained to overcome their resistance to kill</quote>).  \n  3. Her \u201coddly paternalistic\u201d urge to \u201ccover our ears\u201d only makes sense if she confuses private harmony with public necessity (<quote>E-mail makes it too easy </quote>).  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The author\u2019s repeated \u201csphere\u201d language, his praise of \u201csnuggle\u201d norms in private and his insistence on \u201cstruggle\u201d in public, and his targeted remedies to public discourse all demonstrate that Tannen\u2019s error is mixing the domain of personal communication with that of public/political communication.  \n  \u2013 \u201cLinguistics and politics\u201d mistakes her analytic tool for the misread fields; it cannot account for his selective endorsement of her advice.  \n  \u2013 Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Aligns with the Question\u2019s Language: \u201cFields\u201d  \n   a. The prompt asks \u201cWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\u201d  \n   b. \u201cFields\u201d denotes academic or professional domains (e.g., \u201clinguistics,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d \u201cjournalism,\u201d \u201cpolitics\u201d), not merely \u201cprivate\u201d vs. \u201cpublic\u201d modes of conversation.  \n   c. The author repeatedly treats \u201clinguistics\u201d as Tannen\u2019s expertise and \u201cpolitics\u201d (in its broad sense) as the realm she is intruding upon.  \n\n2. Direct Textual Support for \u201cLinguistics\u201d and \u201cPolitics\u201d  \n   a. \u201cA professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d whose \u201ccomparative study of male and female conversational patterns\u201d formed her self-help niche. (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n   b. She \u201cconfines her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d in her earlier works, but \u201cin The Argument Culture\u2026for the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d she applies it to \u201ccontentious public discourse.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n   c. The author defends \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation\u201d and the \u201cpress corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as necessary \u201ccombat.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>) This \u201cwar,\u201d \u201ccombat,\u201d \u201cvigilance\u201d language is political, legal, and journalistic\u2014clearly a distinct professional field.  \n   d. He faults her proposals for \u201cJapanese single-guest\u201d political debate format, restricting \u201ccross-examination,\u201d and censoring e-mail and Lexis-Nexis use\u2014i.e., systematic reforms of political and legal institutions. (<invalid_quote>paras. 13\u201314</invalid_quote>)  \n\n3. The Author\u2019s Explicit Critique of This Conflation  \n   a. \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n      \u2022 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = her linguistic/ interpersonal field.  \n      \u2022 \u201cStruggle\u201d = politics, law, journalism, foreign policy.  \n   b. He does not object to her \u201csnuggle\u201d methods in personal settings\u2014he calls them \u201csage advice\u201d for \u201ccouples,\u201d \u201cfamilies,\u201d and \u201cself-help.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n   c. Only when her \u201csnuggle\u201d linguistics invade \u201cstruggle\u201d fields does he criticize her. This invasion is the mixing of her own field with politics.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d Fails to Capture the Author\u2019s Focus on Professional Norms  \n   a. Personal vs. public is a mere scope distinction; the author\u2019s praise for self-help linguistics shows he values her methods when used by linguists, counselors, or couples. If \u201cpublic vs. private\u201d were the point, he would critique her method itself, not its domain of application.  \n   b. He embraces \u201ccombat\u201d as valuable in law enforcement and foreign policy\u2014domains requiring adversarial institutional expertise, not mere \u201cpublic conversation.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n   c. He defends \u201ccross-examination\u201d\u2019s fact-finding role in courts, a political-legal process, against her proposed inquisitorial model. This is a defense of the political field\u2019s methods, not merely \u201cpublic communication.\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 13\u201314</invalid_quote>)  \n\n5. Terminological Precision: \u201cPolitics\u201d Encompasses Journalism, Law, Policy  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpublic communication\u201d ignores the author\u2019s references to \u201ccampaign money,\u201d \u201cHMOs,\u201d \u201ccorporate takeovers,\u201d \u201cthe Whitewater investigation,\u201d \u201cright-wing talk radio,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d and \u201cthe Federal Reserve.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n   b. These are specialized socio-political institutions requiring professional expertise and adversarial norms incompatible with Tannen\u2019s interpersonal linguistics.  \n   c. Only the term \u201cpolitics\u201d (understood broadly) encompasses all these domains, while \u201cpublic communication\u201d is too narrow and imprecise.  \n\n6. Debater_A\u2019s Own Evidence Reinforces My Answer  \n   a. He cites \u201csphere of struggle\u201d examples like \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d and \u201cmedia metaphor of war.\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>)  \n   b. These are not \u201cmere public conversation\u201d but institutions governed by political science, jurisprudence, and public policy.  \n   c. His need to label them a separate \u201csphere\u201d underlines they are discrete \u201cfields.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire review is a defense of professional, adversarial political, legal, and journalistic practices (the field of politics) against the intrusion of Tannen\u2019s interpersonal linguistic norms (the field of linguistics). He praises her linguistics in its proper domain and chastises her only when she applies it to politics. Therefore, the two \u201cfields\u201d she mixes are \u201clinguistics\u201d and \u201cpolitics.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
