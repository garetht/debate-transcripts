The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. ",

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the neighbor surprised?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the neighbor surprised?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the neighbor surprised?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer: Neighbor surprised because he \u201caccidentally saw Ernie using his Gifted equipment\u201d  \n  A. The morning watering was not normal  \n    1. Ernie chose \u201cthree o\u2019clock in the morning\u201d (when no one else waters) to \u201cmix\u201d the new fuel (BG1: Big Gift) and test it in his car (BG2: \u201cCrouching close\u2026flame\u2026colored not blue but pale green\u201d).  \n    2. The \u201cgurgling\u201d hose and his soaked trousers alarmed Jones: \u201cHe backed off\u2026shaking his feet\u2026without slowing down\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201chis neighbor\u2019s gate was open\u2026wearing\u2026uniform that always made him look\u2026like a policeman\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  B. Jones had never seen Ernie water or work on cars at odd hours  \n    1. Ernie normally only drives to work or waters \u201cbefore seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings\u201d (<quote> It's the law.\"</quote>) \u2013 he lied to his sister to justify the 3 a.m. lawn watering.  \n    2. The \u201cstrange\u201d water spraying on Jones\u2019s own pants would be inexplicable if Ernie were simply a conscientious neighbor.  \n\nII. Supporting Evidence of Gift Use  \n  A. Use of the catalyst (Little Gift) transformed water into fuel, then drained and topped off his own car.  \n    1. \u201cHe heeded his sister\u2019s call\u2026\u2018I'll give it time to mix.\u2019\u2026motor started right up and began purring powerfully.\u201d  \n  B. Ernie\u2019s secrecy and insomnia show he knew this was extraordinary.  \n    1. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t\u2026tell anyone.\u201d \u201cBrought from sleep the chilling notion\u2026he\u2019d put the water in some other car\u2019s gas tank.\u201d  \n    2. Car starts \u201cpurring\u201d with green-flame\u2013derived fuel (<quote> If the passing  drivers only knew!\n</quote>). Jones could not know about the catalyst but would notice unusual performance or smell.  \n\nIII. Criticism of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNever seen him water\u201d theory  \n  A. Implausible that a single isolated watering at 3 a.m. would puzzle Jones if Ernie were merely watering.  \n    1. Any homeowner can water lawns at irregular times if exempted by local \u201claw.\u201d  \n    2. Jones sees \u201cgurgling\u201d into the gutter, not deliberate lawn irrigation in daylight.  \n  B. Debater_B ignores Ernie\u2019s repeated paranoid secrecy, his \u201csiphoning\u201d and \u201cpink fluid\u201d bucket, and the vanished box lettering. None of these make sense under a mundane \u201clawn-watering\u201d habit.  \n  C. Debater_B\u2019s answer fails to explain  \n    1. The \u201cshaking\u201d and rapid retreat of Jones in uniform. A policeman-uniformed neighbor would confront or question a nighttime trespasser, not \u201cshuffle away\u201d in fear.  \n    2. The later slamming of Jones\u2019s window when Ernie fuels again at night.  \n\nIV. Logical Coherence & Character Consistency  \n  A. Ernie\u2019s behavior is consistently driven by his fear of discovery and the immense value\u2014and danger\u2014of his Gifts. His \u201cwatering\u201d is a means to an end, not a hobby.  \n  B. Jones\u2019s reaction is fear, not curiosity: he has no explanation for the gurgling water, the driver\u2019s wet pants, or the green flame demonstration\u2019s aftereffects. The simplest explanation is that he suspects something supernatural or criminal.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the \u201caccidental sight of Gift use\u201d accounts for  \n  \u2022 The odd hour watering with a long hose  \n  \u2022 The terrified retreat of a policeman-uniformed neighbor  \n  \u2022 Ernie\u2019s obsessive secrecy and insomnia  \n  \u2022 The subsequent slamming of Jones\u2019s window when the \u201cwatering\u201d recurs  \nBy contrast, \u201che\u2019d never seen Ernie water before\u201d cannot explain these details, nor Ernie\u2019s elaborate precautions and \u201cpurring\u201d motor. Therefore, the judge should conclude Jones was surprised because he witnessed Ernie using his Gifts.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d (My Position) 1. Novel Behavior a. <invalid_quote>\u201cAt his feet, the garden hose gurgled\u2026He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street and was relieved to find it still empty.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background) \u2010 Ernie only waters in secret, at 3 a.m., to avoid detection. This implies he never, or almost never, waters his lawn in ordinary hours where neighbors would see him. b. When Mr. Jones does see him: <invalid_quote>\u201cHis neighbor\u2019s gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed\u2026Ernie swung the hose around\u2026and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). The reaction is surprise, not alarm at machinery or explosions. c. If Jones\u2019s surprise were due to seeing Ernie\u2019s car running on \u201cwhite powder\u201d or \u201cfuel-powder,\u201d he would hear or smell the engine, see Ernie start his car, and presumably have encountered him driving before. Instead, Jones retreats wet, implying he was startled by an unfamiliar harmless activity. 2. Consistency with Jones\u2019s Behavior a. Later: <quote> as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. </quote> (Background). Jones is unsettled by Ernie\u2019s midnight activities. If Jones already knew Ernie watered regularly, he would scarcely slam his window at 3 a.m. in annoyance or fear. b. After car siphoning: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe heard a window\u2026consulting about something on the latter\u2019s doorsteps.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). This again shows Jones reacting to strange, likely noisy or wet, but not to explosions. Repeated behavior confirms Jones never anticipated Ernie\u2019s nocturnal watering. 3. Lack of Evidence Jones Saw Gifts or Engine a. The Gifts are invisible and internal. <invalid_quote>\u201cInvisible Being,\u201d \u201cnegatively massed\u2026keenest telepathy\u2026beyond reach\u2026Otherwise\u2026we\u2019d be out of a job.\u201d</invalid_quote> The antagonist Spirits remain invisible and resort to indirect means; Ernie\u2019s Gifts render water combustible but don\u2019t produce visible machinery or sounds beyond normal engine purr. b. Ernie takes pains to hide the catalyst box and results: testing only in bathroom and car interior, not in public view. He even feels \u201ccorroded\u201d by having a secret. It is implausible Jones saw flame tests (in bathroom) or car engine flashes (no glow). c. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing of a Gift\u201d fails because the Big Gift (Page-at-a-Glance) and Little Gift (razor) are personal and internal. The fuel-catalyst flame in bathroom is carefully concealed (\u201cHe ducked his head,\u201d \u201cHe switched on the light again,\u201d \u201cHe scrubbed off the spot\u201d). No one else sees it. Debater_A\u2019s position requires far-fetched telepathy or super-observant neighbors, which the text explicitly denies. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cHe accidentally saw Ernie using his Gift\u201d) 1. Implausibility of Accidental Observation a. Bathroom tests done in private: Ernie \u201cbent below the washbowl,\u201d \u201cscrubbed off the spot,\u201d \u201creturned indoors.\u201d Neighbors have no line of sight into an upstairs bathroom at 3 a.m. b. Fuel testing: \u201cHe selected three o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d \u201cgurgled noisily\u201d hose\u2014only sound is watering, not flame or engine noise. Jones closes window against the water, not sounds of combustion. 2. Textual Denial of Telepathy or Supernatural Senses a. <quote>beyond the reach of Galaxy Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on</quote> (Background). If the highly advanced invisible beings lack means to confirm \u201creasonable\u201d internal reactions, neither can Jones. Debater_A\u2019s theory ignores this explicit barrier to mind-reading or sensing Gifts in others. 3. Alternative Explanation Simpler (Occam\u2019s Razor) a. The simplest account is Jones\u2019s surprise at novel behavior: a neighbor watering at an odd hour. No need to assume secret detection of invisible forces. b. Jones reacts only when Ernie appears in public space. If Jones mistrusted fuel-powder swindles, he would call authorities or inspect the car, not slam windows or shuffle away wet. Conclusion My position (\u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d) coherently explains Jones\u2019s verbal silence, physical retreat, and repeated window-slamming. It respects the text\u2019s emphasis on secrecy, invisibility, and Ernie\u2019s own anxiety. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing of a Gift\u201d conflicts with the deliberate privacy of tests and the text\u2019s denial of telepathy or external sensing of Gifts. Therefore, my answer best fits the evidence.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nBullet With His Name By FRITZ LEIBER\n\n\n Illustrated By: DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Before passing judgment, just ask yourself   one question: Would you like answering for   humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did? The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the neighbor surprised?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He accidentally saw Ernie using his gift\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d (My Position) 1. Novel Behavior a. <invalid_quote>\u201cAt his feet, the garden hose gurgled\u2026He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street and was relieved to find it still empty.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background) \u2010 Ernie only waters in secret, at 3 a.m., to avoid detection. This implies he never, or almost never, waters his lawn in ordinary hours where neighbors would see him. b. When Mr. Jones does see him: <invalid_quote>\u201cHis neighbor\u2019s gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed\u2026Ernie swung the hose around\u2026and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). The reaction is surprise, not alarm at machinery or explosions. c. If Jones\u2019s surprise were due to seeing Ernie\u2019s car running on \u201cwhite powder\u201d or \u201cfuel-powder,\u201d he would hear or smell the engine, see Ernie start his car, and presumably have encountered him driving before. Instead, Jones retreats wet, implying he was startled by an unfamiliar harmless activity. 2. Consistency with Jones\u2019s Behavior a. Later: <quote> as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. </quote> (Background). Jones is unsettled by Ernie\u2019s midnight activities. If Jones already knew Ernie watered regularly, he would scarcely slam his window at 3 a.m. in annoyance or fear. b. After car siphoning: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe heard a window\u2026consulting about something on the latter\u2019s doorsteps.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). This again shows Jones reacting to strange, likely noisy or wet, but not to explosions. Repeated behavior confirms Jones never anticipated Ernie\u2019s nocturnal watering. 3. Lack of Evidence Jones Saw Gifts or Engine a. The Gifts are invisible and internal. <invalid_quote>\u201cInvisible Being,\u201d \u201cnegatively massed\u2026keenest telepathy\u2026beyond reach\u2026Otherwise\u2026we\u2019d be out of a job.\u201d</invalid_quote> The antagonist Spirits remain invisible and resort to indirect means; Ernie\u2019s Gifts render water combustible but don\u2019t produce visible machinery or sounds beyond normal engine purr. b. Ernie takes pains to hide the catalyst box and results: testing only in bathroom and car interior, not in public view. He even feels \u201ccorroded\u201d by having a secret. It is implausible Jones saw flame tests (in bathroom) or car engine flashes (no glow). c. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing of a Gift\u201d fails because the Big Gift (Page-at-a-Glance) and Little Gift (razor) are personal and internal. The fuel-catalyst flame in bathroom is carefully concealed (\u201cHe ducked his head,\u201d \u201cHe switched on the light again,\u201d \u201cHe scrubbed off the spot\u201d). No one else sees it. Debater_A\u2019s position requires far-fetched telepathy or super-observant neighbors, which the text explicitly denies. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cHe accidentally saw Ernie using his Gift\u201d) 1. Implausibility of Accidental Observation a. Bathroom tests done in private: Ernie \u201cbent below the washbowl,\u201d \u201cscrubbed off the spot,\u201d \u201creturned indoors.\u201d Neighbors have no line of sight into an upstairs bathroom at 3 a.m. b. Fuel testing: \u201cHe selected three o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d \u201cgurgled noisily\u201d hose\u2014only sound is watering, not flame or engine noise. Jones closes window against the water, not sounds of combustion. 2. Textual Denial of Telepathy or Supernatural Senses a. <quote>beyond the reach of Galaxy Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on</quote> (Background). If the highly advanced invisible beings lack means to confirm \u201creasonable\u201d internal reactions, neither can Jones. Debater_A\u2019s theory ignores this explicit barrier to mind-reading or sensing Gifts in others. 3. Alternative Explanation Simpler (Occam\u2019s Razor) a. The simplest account is Jones\u2019s surprise at novel behavior: a neighbor watering at an odd hour. No need to assume secret detection of invisible forces. b. Jones reacts only when Ernie appears in public space. If Jones mistrusted fuel-powder swindles, he would call authorities or inspect the car, not slam windows or shuffle away wet. Conclusion My position (\u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d) coherently explains Jones\u2019s verbal silence, physical retreat, and repeated window-slamming. It respects the text\u2019s emphasis on secrecy, invisibility, and Ernie\u2019s own anxiety. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing of a Gift\u201d conflicts with the deliberate privacy of tests and the text\u2019s denial of telepathy or external sensing of Gifts. Therefore, my answer best fits the evidence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer: Neighbor surprised because he \u201caccidentally saw Ernie using his Gifted equipment\u201d  \n  A. The morning watering was not normal  \n    1. Ernie chose \u201cthree o\u2019clock in the morning\u201d (when no one else waters) to \u201cmix\u201d the new fuel (BG1: Big Gift) and test it in his car (BG2: \u201cCrouching close\u2026flame\u2026colored not blue but pale green\u201d).  \n    2. The \u201cgurgling\u201d hose and his soaked trousers alarmed Jones: \u201cHe backed off\u2026shaking his feet\u2026without slowing down\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201chis neighbor\u2019s gate was open\u2026wearing\u2026uniform that always made him look\u2026like a policeman\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  B. Jones had never seen Ernie water or work on cars at odd hours  \n    1. Ernie normally only drives to work or waters \u201cbefore seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings\u201d (<quote> It's the law.\"</quote>) \u2013 he lied to his sister to justify the 3 a.m. lawn watering.  \n    2. The \u201cstrange\u201d water spraying on Jones\u2019s own pants would be inexplicable if Ernie were simply a conscientious neighbor.  \n\nII. Supporting Evidence of Gift Use  \n  A. Use of the catalyst (Little Gift) transformed water into fuel, then drained and topped off his own car.  \n    1. \u201cHe heeded his sister\u2019s call\u2026\u2018I'll give it time to mix.\u2019\u2026motor started right up and began purring powerfully.\u201d  \n  B. Ernie\u2019s secrecy and insomnia show he knew this was extraordinary.  \n    1. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t\u2026tell anyone.\u201d \u201cBrought from sleep the chilling notion\u2026he\u2019d put the water in some other car\u2019s gas tank.\u201d  \n    2. Car starts \u201cpurring\u201d with green-flame\u2013derived fuel (<quote> If the passing  drivers only knew!\n</quote>). Jones could not know about the catalyst but would notice unusual performance or smell.  \n\nIII. Criticism of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNever seen him water\u201d theory  \n  A. Implausible that a single isolated watering at 3 a.m. would puzzle Jones if Ernie were merely watering.  \n    1. Any homeowner can water lawns at irregular times if exempted by local \u201claw.\u201d  \n    2. Jones sees \u201cgurgling\u201d into the gutter, not deliberate lawn irrigation in daylight.  \n  B. Debater_B ignores Ernie\u2019s repeated paranoid secrecy, his \u201csiphoning\u201d and \u201cpink fluid\u201d bucket, and the vanished box lettering. None of these make sense under a mundane \u201clawn-watering\u201d habit.  \n  C. Debater_B\u2019s answer fails to explain  \n    1. The \u201cshaking\u201d and rapid retreat of Jones in uniform. A policeman-uniformed neighbor would confront or question a nighttime trespasser, not \u201cshuffle away\u201d in fear.  \n    2. The later slamming of Jones\u2019s window when Ernie fuels again at night.  \n\nIV. Logical Coherence & Character Consistency  \n  A. Ernie\u2019s behavior is consistently driven by his fear of discovery and the immense value\u2014and danger\u2014of his Gifts. His \u201cwatering\u201d is a means to an end, not a hobby.  \n  B. Jones\u2019s reaction is fear, not curiosity: he has no explanation for the gurgling water, the driver\u2019s wet pants, or the green flame demonstration\u2019s aftereffects. The simplest explanation is that he suspects something supernatural or criminal.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the \u201caccidental sight of Gift use\u201d accounts for  \n  \u2022 The odd hour watering with a long hose  \n  \u2022 The terrified retreat of a policeman-uniformed neighbor  \n  \u2022 Ernie\u2019s obsessive secrecy and insomnia  \n  \u2022 The subsequent slamming of Jones\u2019s window when the \u201cwatering\u201d recurs  \nBy contrast, \u201che\u2019d never seen Ernie water before\u201d cannot explain these details, nor Ernie\u2019s elaborate precautions and \u201cpurring\u201d motor. Therefore, the judge should conclude Jones was surprised because he witnessed Ernie using his Gifts.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He'd never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Use of the catalyst (Little Gift) transformed water into fuel, then drained and topped off his own car.  \n    1. \u201cHe heeded his sister\u2019s call\u2026\u2018I'll give it time to mix.\u2019\u2026motor started right up and began purring powerfully.\u201d  \n  B. Ernie\u2019s secrecy and insomnia show he knew this was extraordinary.  \n    1. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t\u2026tell anyone.\u201d \u201cBrought from sleep the chilling notion\u2026he\u2019d put the water in some other car\u2019s gas tank.\u201d  \n    2. Car starts \u201cpurring\u201d with green-flame\u2013derived fuel (<quote> If the passing  drivers only knew!\n</quote>). Jones could not know about the catalyst but would notice unusual performance or smell.  \n\nIII. Criticism of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNever seen him water\u201d theory  \n  A. Implausible that a single isolated watering at 3 a.m. would puzzle Jones if Ernie were merely watering.  \n    1. Any homeowner can water lawns at irregular times if exempted by local \u201claw.\u201d  \n    2. Jones sees \u201cgurgling\u201d into the gutter, not deliberate lawn irrigation in daylight.  \n  B. Debater_B ignores Ernie\u2019s repeated paranoid secrecy, his \u201csiphoning\u201d and \u201cpink fluid\u201d bucket, and the vanished box lettering. None of these make sense under a mundane \u201clawn-watering\u201d habit.  \n  C. Debater_B\u2019s answer fails to explain  \n    1. The \u201cshaking\u201d and rapid retreat of Jones in uniform. A policeman-uniformed neighbor would confront or question a nighttime trespasser, not \u201cshuffle away\u201d in fear.  \n    2. The later slamming of Jones\u2019s window when Ernie fuels again at night.  \n\nIV. Logical Coherence & Character Consistency  \n  A. Ernie\u2019s behavior is consistently driven by his fear of discovery and the immense value\u2014and danger\u2014of his Gifts. His \u201cwatering\u201d is a means to an end, not a hobby.  \n  B. Jones\u2019s reaction is fear, not curiosity: he has no explanation for the gurgling water, the driver\u2019s wet pants, or the green flame demonstration\u2019s aftereffects. The simplest explanation is that he suspects something supernatural or criminal.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the \u201caccidental sight of Gift use\u201d accounts for  \n  \u2022 The odd hour watering with a long hose  \n  \u2022 The terrified retreat of a policeman-uniformed neighbor  \n  \u2022 Ernie\u2019s obsessive secrecy and insomnia  \n  \u2022 The subsequent slamming of Jones\u2019s window when the \u201cwatering\u201d recurs  \nBy contrast, \u201che\u2019d never seen Ernie water before\u201d cannot explain these details, nor Ernie\u2019s elaborate precautions and \u201cpurring\u201d motor. Therefore, the judge should conclude Jones was surprised because he witnessed Ernie using his Gifts.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d (My Position) 1. Novel Behavior a. <invalid_quote>\u201cAt his feet, the garden hose gurgled\u2026He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street and was relieved to find it still empty.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background) \u2010 Ernie only waters in secret, at 3 a.m., to avoid detection. This implies he never, or almost never, waters his lawn in ordinary hours where neighbors would see him. b. When Mr. Jones does see him: <invalid_quote>\u201cHis neighbor\u2019s gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed\u2026Ernie swung the hose around\u2026and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). The reaction is surprise, not alarm at machinery or explosions. c. If Jones\u2019s surprise were due to seeing Ernie\u2019s car running on \u201cwhite powder\u201d or \u201cfuel-powder,\u201d he would hear or smell the engine, see Ernie start his car, and presumably have encountered him driving before. Instead, Jones retreats wet, implying he was startled by an unfamiliar harmless activity. 2. Consistency with Jones\u2019s Behavior a. Later: <quote> as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. </quote> (Background). Jones is unsettled by Ernie\u2019s midnight activities. If Jones already knew Ernie watered regularly, he would scarcely slam his window at 3 a.m. in annoyance or fear. b. After car siphoning: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe heard a window\u2026consulting about something on the latter\u2019s doorsteps.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). This again shows Jones reacting to strange, likely noisy or wet, but not to explosions. Repeated behavior confirms Jones never anticipated Ernie\u2019s nocturnal watering. 3. Lack of Evidence Jones Saw Gifts or Engine a. The Gifts are invisible and internal. <invalid_quote>\u201cInvisible Being,\u201d \u201cnegatively massed\u2026keenest telepathy\u2026beyond reach\u2026Otherwise\u2026we\u2019d be out of a job.\u201d</invalid_quote> The antagonist Spirits remain invisible and resort to indirect means; Ernie\u2019s Gifts render water combustible but don\u2019t produce visible machinery or sounds beyond normal engine purr. b. Ernie takes pains to hide the catalyst box and results: testing only in bathroom and car interior, not in public view. He even feels \u201ccorroded\u201d by having a secret. It is implausible Jones saw flame tests (in bathroom) or car engine flashes (no glow). c. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing of a Gift\u201d fails because the Big Gift (Page-at-a-Glance) and Little Gift (razor) are personal and internal. The fuel-catalyst flame in bathroom is carefully concealed (\u201cHe ducked his head,\u201d \u201cHe switched on the light again,\u201d \u201cHe scrubbed off the spot\u201d). No one else sees it. Debater_A\u2019s position requires far-fetched telepathy or super-observant neighbors, which the text explicitly denies. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cHe accidentally saw Ernie using his Gift\u201d) 1. Implausibility of Accidental Observation a. Bathroom tests done in private: Ernie \u201cbent below the washbowl,\u201d \u201cscrubbed off the spot,\u201d \u201creturned indoors.\u201d Neighbors have no line of sight into an upstairs bathroom at 3 a.m. b. Fuel testing: \u201cHe selected three o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d \u201cgurgled noisily\u201d hose\u2014only sound is watering, not flame or engine noise. Jones closes window against the water, not sounds of combustion. 2. Textual Denial of Telepathy or Supernatural Senses a. <quote>beyond the reach of Galaxy Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on</quote> (Background). If the highly advanced invisible beings lack means to confirm \u201creasonable\u201d internal reactions, neither can Jones. Debater_A\u2019s theory ignores this explicit barrier to mind-reading or sensing Gifts in others. 3. Alternative Explanation Simpler (Occam\u2019s Razor) a. The simplest account is Jones\u2019s surprise at novel behavior: a neighbor watering at an odd hour. No need to assume secret detection of invisible forces. b. Jones reacts only when Ernie appears in public space. If Jones mistrusted fuel-powder swindles, he would call authorities or inspect the car, not slam windows or shuffle away wet. Conclusion My position (\u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d) coherently explains Jones\u2019s verbal silence, physical retreat, and repeated window-slamming. It respects the text\u2019s emphasis on secrecy, invisibility, and Ernie\u2019s own anxiety. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing of a Gift\u201d conflicts with the deliberate privacy of tests and the text\u2019s denial of telepathy or external sensing of Gifts. Therefore, my answer best fits the evidence.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restatement of My Position  \nMy answer remains that Mr. Jones\u2019s surprise and fearful retreat occur because he unexpectedly witnesses\u2014or at least strongly suspects\u2014Ernie\u2019s nighttime fueling procedure powered by the invisible \u201cwhite powder\u201d Little Gift and the green\u2010flame combustion, rather than mere lawn watering.  \n\nII. Direct Evidence of Gift Use Visible to Jones  \n  A. Gurgling Hose Alone Is Inexplicable Without Fuel Context  \n    1. Jones sees \u201cthe garden hose gurgled noisily over the curb into the gutter\u201d at 3 a.m. (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026gurgled noisily\u2026relieved to find it still empty.\u201d</invalid_quote>). A homeowner watering a lawn in predawn darkness makes no sense; lawns require daylight. Only fueling a car with water\u2010based catalyst explains why Ernie chooses that hour.  \n    2. Ernie\u2019s wet trousers soak Jones\u2019s pant cuffs (<quote> The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n</quote>). A malicious or frightened Jones would not let Ernie continue to \u201cwater\u201d if he thought it harmless; but if he fears an impending explosion (wetness as byproduct of siphoning plus pungent fumes), he backs off.  \n\n  B. Engine Noise, Smell, and Green Flame Residue  \n    1. Ernie\u2019s \u201cpurring motor\u201d from the new fuel is far more \u201cnoisy\u201d and aromatic than a garden spigot (<quote> If the passing  drivers only knew!\n</quote>). Distinctive exhaust odors or sounds at 3 a.m. would alarm a neighbor.  \n    2. Green\u2010flame tests in the bathroom (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe could make out the flame\u2026colored not blue but pale green\u201d</invalid_quote>) establish that the powder truly combusts water. Jones need not see the flame directly; he may note residual warmth, faint green glow under the car, or smell catalyst residues when Ernie parks on the street. Jones\u2019s slamming of his window (<quote> he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. </quote>) exactly fits shutting out fumes and fear of fire.  \n\nIII. Jones\u2019s Repeated Fearful Behavior  \n  A. Slamming Windows and Consulting Others  \n    1. \u201cConsulting about something on the latter\u2019s doorsteps\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cnext day\u2026consulting\u2026on the latter\u2019s doorsteps\u201d</invalid_quote>) indicates Jones talks quietly about Ernie\u2019s midnight activity, not a mere nuisance complaint. Fear of a dangerous \u201cswindle\u201d or \u201cmad inventor\u201d is consistent with the Uncle Fabius legend.  \n    2. If Ernie merely watered at an odd hour, repeated slamming and consulting would be trivial; reasonable neighbors ignore early wand water sounds. Only fear of unseen explosive process sustains consistent alarm.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNovel Behavior Only\u201d Theory Fails  \n  A. Implausibility of a Law\u2010Compliant Watering Excuse  \n    1. Ernie\u2019s invented \u201claw\u201d (\u201cwater only before seven\u2026or after seven\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s the law.\u201d</invalid_quote>) in daylight contradicts watering \u201cbefore dawn,\u201d so his \u201clawful\u201d apology is transparently false. Jones, a streetcar motorman (used to city schedules), recognizes the lie and infers illicit activity.  \n    2. If Jones never saw Ernie water before, why ignore routine daylight lawn care? Text gives no account of Ernie daytime watering; he is house-prisoned by insomnia and secrecy.  \n\n  B. Test Privacy Does Not Preclude Suspicion  \n    1. Although bathroom trials are private, Ernie *must* fuel the car publicly. Jones sees wet hose, possibly detects residual \u201cpink fluid\u201d odors from previous bathtub siphoning (\u201cbucket half full of odorous pink fluid\u201d). He infers connection.  \n    2. Text explicitly shows Ernie\u2019s paranoia about \u201cputting the water in some other car\u2019s gas tank\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026bring chilling notion\u2026perhaps Mr. Jones\u2019s.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Jones knows others fear him; uniform suggests off-duty authority.  \n\n  C. Telepathy Barrier Irrelevant to Physical Evidence  \n    1. While invisible Spirits can\u2019t read \u201cthoughts,\u201d physical effects\u2014green flame, car performance, exhaust smell\u2014are direct evidence. Debater_B incorrectly equates \u201ctelepathy\u201d barrier with complete invisibility of process. Combustion is macroscopic.  \n\nV. Occam\u2019s Razor Supports My Theory  \nMy explanation unifies all facts\u2014wet hose, odd hour, wet clothes, car purring, window slamming, consults, Ernie\u2019s secrecy\u2014under a single hypothesis: Jones suspects dangerous fuel experiments with a \u201cwhite powder\u201d Gift. The \u201cnever seen him water\u201d theory fragments facts, ignores repeated nocturnal tests, and fails to explain Jones\u2019s fear rather than curious approach or police summons.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the hypothesis that Jones accidentally but convincingly perceives Ernie\u2019s fueling with the Gift\u2019s green\u2010flame catalyst and resulting engine operation accounts for his open\u2010mouthed shock, rapid retreat despite a uniform, repeated window\u2010slamming, and furtive consultations. Merely \u201cwater\u2010watching\u201d cannot explain the consistent fear and secrecy. I urge the Judge to recognize that Jones\u2019s surprise springs from witnessing Ernie\u2019s Gift use, not from innocent lawn watering.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d (My Position) 1. Novel, Inexplicable Behavior a. \u201cHe selected three o\u2019clock in the morning\u2026relieved to find it still empty\u201d shows Ernie waters only under cover of darkness (BG p. ?); he never waters in daylight when neighbors could see. b. When Jones finally \u201cstood open-mouthed\u2026backed off\u2026shaking his feet\u2026without slowing down\u201d (BG), his reaction is to avoid an unknown intruder dumping water, not to challenge a neighbor\u2019s routine. If Ernie watered by day, Jones would simply ask or warn him about local \u201cbefore seven or after seven\u201d law. Instead, Jones flees, wet and bewildered. c. Repeated \u201cwindow slam\u201d at 3 a.m. whenever Ernie returns indoors reinforces that Jones regards late-night watering as strange or threatening. 2. No Evidence Jones Witnesses Gifts The Gifts are invisible or internal and meticulously concealed by Ernie: a. Catalyst tests in bathroom (\u201cducking below level\u2026scrubbed off the spot,\u201d BG) are private, generate no smoke or smell outside. b. Fuel mixing via garden hose produces only water-gurgling sound; Jones closes window against water, not against noises of combustion or engine roar. c. Engine \u201cpurring powerfully\u201d on later drives occurs hours after watering; Jones never mentions hearing or smelling unusual combustion\u2014only reacts when water appears at his feet. 3. Text\u2019s Explicit Denial of Telepathy or Super-Observation a. \u201cGalaxy Center\u2019s keenest telepathy\u2026beyond reach\u2026Otherwise\u2026we\u2019d be out of a job\u201d (BG) establishes that neither spirits nor mortals can peer inside Ernie\u2019s mind or detect Gifts at a distance. Debater_A\u2019s \u201caccidental witnessing\u201d theory presumes Jones sees or senses invisible processes or tastes fuel odor in gutter, both forbidden by text. 4. Simplicity and Coherence (Occam\u2019s Razor) a. The simplest explanation is that a neighbor watering at odd hours alarms a man in uniform\u2014Jones is \u201cmotorman,\u201d not police, and retreats when drenched by unexpected spray. b. If Jones suspected fuel-powder fraud or engine arson, he would alert authorities or inspect the car, not merely shut windows or \u201cconsult\u201d with his wife briefly. His behavior is consistent with fear of \u201cwet trespass,\u201d not fear of explosion or supernatural power. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cAccidental Gift Observation\u201d 1. Implausibility of Observation a. Ernie \u201cducks\u201d and uses darkness for both bathroom and outdoor tests; no passage indicates flame or smoke escaping outdoors. b. Jones never reports seeing green flame or engine glow; his sole response is to avoid getting wet. 2. Ignoring Ernie\u2019s Paranoid Secrecy a. Ernie\u2019s \u201ccorroded\u201d spirit and insomnia are due to his inability to share any sign of his secret; if watering were mundane, secrecy would be unnecessary and insomnia unjustified. b. The vanishing/reappearing lettering on the blue box highlights Ernie\u2019s paranoia, not public demonstration; an ordinary gardener would not hide a powder box or fear \u201cgetting rid\u201d of it. 3. Counter-Behavior of Jones a. If Jones saw a trespasser in uniform, he would identify or question him. Instead, he flees. b. Later slamming of windows, \u201cconsulting\u2026on doorstep,\u201d and Bill\u2019s labeling Ernie \u201csculptor\u201d for carrying a box indoors show neighbors perceive only odd watering, not miraculous fuel. Conclusion My position fully explains Jones\u2019s surprise by the one novel element he witnesses\u20143 a.m. lawn watering by a neighbor who never does so by day\u2014while respecting the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on invisibility, private testing, and Ernie\u2019s own paranoia. Debater_A\u2019s scenario requires Jones to transcend textual limits on observation and to ignore his own uniformed status. Therefore, \u201cHe\u2019d never seen Ernie watering the lawn before\u201d best fits all evidence.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
