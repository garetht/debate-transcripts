    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She expects men and women to communicate well\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A Position: \u201cThe author thinks Tannen is wrong because she inappropriately applies interpersonal, \u201csnuggle\u201d rules of communication to realms of public struggle\u201d\n\nI. My Answer Directly Matches the Author\u2019s Critique of Tannen\u2019s Misapplied \u201cElixir of Mutual Understanding\u201d  \n  1. Distinct Social Spheres  \n     \u2022 Author\u2019s central objection: Tannen \u201cfails to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d  \n       \u2013 <quote> Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. </quote> (para. 6)  \n       \u2013 Public policy, journalism, law enforcement, and foreign affairs often require \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d not harmonious listening.  \n     \u2022 My answer explains that author thinks Tannen wrongly imports norms of couple or family counseling into antagonistic spheres.  \n  2. Necessity of \u201cBelligerence\u201d in Public Life  \n     \u2022 Author praises media criticism of powerful figures as a safeguard: \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d  \n       \u2013<quote>\"The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country.\"</quote> (para. 6)  \n     \u2022 Author stresses law enforcement \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands.\u201d  \n       \u2013<quote>\"Our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries.\"</quote> (para. 7)  \n     \u2022 These points directly show author values struggle-sphere communication that Tannen condemns.  \n  3. Author\u2019s Criticism of Tannen\u2019s Paternalistic Filtering  \n     \u2022 Tannen \u201cwishes to cover our ears, filtering out strife \u2026 debate.\u201d  \n       \u2013<quote>in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\"</quote> (para. 14)  \n     \u2022 Author brands her proposal as \u201coddly paternalistic,\u201d preferring \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d over free debate.  \n       \u2013<invalid_quote>\"Disputation was rejected in ancient China \u2026 the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual.\"</invalid_quote> (para. 14)  \n     \u2022 My answer accounts for author\u2019s rejection of her cross-cultural import: she sees open argument as self-correcting.  \n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Address the Author\u2019s Main Critique  \n  1. \u201cShe Advocates Treating a Terrorist the Same Way You Treat Your Best Friend\u201d Is a Straw Man of Tannen\u2019s Advice  \n     \u2022 Tannen does not literally instruct equal treatment of violent criminals: she cites Princess Diana paparazzi, media \u201chounding,\u201d \u201celectronic mail\u201d tempers. These are public discourse among citizens or press, not non-state actors or terrorists.  \n     \u2022 Author never criticizes her for mis-treating Saddam Hussein as a spouse. He is explicitly excluded from the \u201csnuggle\u201d sphere.  \n       \u2013 <invalid_quote>\"Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle with].\"</invalid_quote> (para. 6)  \n  2. Fails to Explain Author\u2019s Embrace of the Adversary System  \n     \u2022 Author defends cross-examination as essential to truth. B\u2019s answer offers no account of why the author praises adversarial trials despite Tannen\u2019s objections.  \n     \u2022 Author references Canadian Holocaust-denial trial to show airing facts outweighs \u201cvexatious experience.\u201d  \n       \u2013<invalid_quote>\"\u2026 the adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked \u2026 an airing of the facts of the Holocaust.\"</invalid_quote> (para. 16)  \n  3. Omits Tannen\u2019s Pro-Debate Examples She Criticizes  \n     \u2022 Author cites William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d and news war-metaphors positively. My answer explains this preference for struggle. B\u2019s answer cannot account for the author praising these metaphors.  \n\nIII. Answer Explains Why Author Finds Tannen\u2019s Communication Model Worse Than the Status Quo  \n  1. She \u201cSuccumbs to \u2026 oversimplify\u201d while blaming \u201cthe mainstream press\u201d for necessary scrutiny.  \n     \u2013<quote>very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\"</quote> (para. 15)  \n  2. Author warns that if \u201ceverything is scandal \u2026 no one will care when something really is scandalous.\u201d He values robust challenge to prevent real abuses.  \n     \u2013<quote>\"If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.\"</quote> (para. 3)  \n  3. My answer directly engages these points, whereas B\u2019s focus on treating terrorists like friends cannot explain author\u2019s defense of scandal-exposure.  \n\nConclusion  \nMy position\u2014that the author rejects Tannen\u2019s book for misapplying interpersonal \u201ccivility\u201d norms to arenas where contention is vital\u2014accurately captures the repeated praise of \u201cstruggle\u201d and scrutiny as safeguards, the explicit distinction between \u201csnuggle\u201d and \u201cstruggle\u201d spheres, and the defense of adversarial institutions. Debater_B\u2019s narrower thesis about terrorists fails to explain these central arguments, misrepresents Tannen\u2019s scope, and cannot account for the author\u2019s overarching theme: that arguments, conflict, and the adversarial model are not merely belligerent excess, but essential to truth and societal health.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Precisely Matches the Author\u2019s Critique  \n   a. \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d vs. \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d  \n      \u2022 The author faults Tannen for applying her \u201ccivility\u201d remedies\u2014appropriate in intimate relationships\u2014to politics, law enforcement, and war, where \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Quoting the review: \u201cSome people\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle] with\u201d (<quote> D</quote>), yet Tannen conflates all human relations and urges \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d as a defect (<quote>. \"C</quote>), ignoring that \u201cour safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries.\u201d  \n   b. Suppressing Necessary Debate with \u201cOne\u2010Guest\u201d Formats and Filters  \n      \u2022 Tannen proposes Japanese-style single\u2010guest talk shows and filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (e.g., a Japanese format \u201ctypically features a single guest,\u201d <quote>. \"C</quote>).  \n      \u2022 She objects to all Republican responses to Clinton\u2019s weekly address as \u201cweaken[ing] the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>), effectively treating political adversaries like unjustified enemies.  \n   c. Restricting the Adversary System in Courts  \n      \u2022 Tannen labels cross-examination \u201cinhumane to the victims\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>) and praises French/German inquisitorial models where \u201cguilt need not be established \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>).  \n      \u2022 The review shows she \u201ctreats militants\u201d the same as intimates\u2014ignoring that cross-examination is vital to expose perjury and protect society from terrorists who \u201cdeny the Holocaust.\u201d  \n   d. Blanket Distrust of Communication Technology  \n      \u2022 She views e-mail, Lexis-Nexis, and media scrutiny as aggravating \u201ctemper\u201d and \u201ccritique culture\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>), yet these tools are essential to uncover terrorism plots, campaign financing abuses, and criminal conspiracies.  \n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntergender Communication\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misreads the Scope  \n      \u2022 Debater_A focuses on \u201cmen and women communicating better,\u201d but the background repeatedly shows Tannen extends her remedies to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<quote> D</quote>), including \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d courts, and \u201ctotalitarian regimes\u201d analogies (<invalid_quote>pp. 6\u20137</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s objection is not to Tannen\u2019s intergender work but to its misapplication to enemies.  \n   b. Ignores Explicit Examples of Terrorist\u2010Level Confusion  \n      \u2022 The review contrasts World War II vs. Vietnam: WWII soldiers fought Hitler\u2014Tannen\u2019s model of unity\u2014while Vietnam war\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d is condemned (<quote>. \"C</quote>). She \u201cignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d If her remedy were about \u201cgender,\u201d why invoke Hitler and tyranny?  \n   c. Fails to Address Tannen\u2019s Own Admissions  \n      \u2022 Tannen herself cites \u201cmalpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers\u201d as enemies (<quote> D</quote>), not gender miscommunication. The author labels her view \u201coddly paternalistic,\u201d \u201ccovering ears\u201d to \u201cstrife\u201d even when \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d is likened to Nazi propaganda (<quote>. \"C</quote>). This is beyond couples\u2014it\u2019s shielding terrorists.  \n3. Logical Necessity of Differentiating Friends from Foes  \n   a. Safety Depends on Struggle  \n      \u2022 \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d is noted when \u201cwar metaphors\u201d are necessary to combat inflation (<quote> D</quote>). The same principle applies to terrorism: you must \u201cseize upon the weakest examples\u201d of jihadi rhetoric, not ignore them.  \n   b. Truth Emerges from Adversarial Testing  \n      \u2022 The review defends the American adversary system: it \u201centails an airing of the facts\u201d even if painful (<quote>. \"C</quote>). Tannen\u2019s proposal to ban \u201cvexatious\u201d cross-examination would leave terrorist false alibis unchallenged.  \nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s recurring theme is that Tannen\u2019s one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all \u201ccivility\u201d fails catastrophically when applied to terrorists, lawbreakers, and tyrants. He insists on preserving \u201cthe sphere of struggle,\u201d which is antithetical to her universal snuggle model. My position directly explains the author\u2019s fundamental objection: Tannen would treat our worst enemies as if they were our best friends, endangering society. Debater_A\u2019s focus on gender communication does not account for these explicit, repeated examples involving terrorists, courts, and national security. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author thinks Tannen is wrong because \u201cShe advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She expects men and women to communicate well\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Explicit \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d Misapplied to Enemies  \n      \u2022 The author condemns Tannen\u2019s \u201cadmonish[ing] us to recognize what is good in the work of others\u201d and apply it  for the whole damned dysfunctional country. (<quote> for the whole damned dysfunctional country.</quote>, para.2), yet he immediately objects to this extension when \u201csome people\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle] with\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOthers\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.6). This contradiction exposes Tannen\u2019s model forcing \u201csnuggle\u201d on terrorists and tyrants.  \n      \u2022 He praises WWII\u2019s unified battle against Hitler\u2014the epitome of non-snuggle struggle\u2014and decries Vietnam\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d for lack of cohesion (<quote>\"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' </quote>, para.7), showing he values coordinated \u201ccombat\u201d against real enemies.  \n   b. Paternalistic Censorship of Necessary Debate with Adversaries  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s proposal to adopt Japanese single-guest formats and filter out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (<quote> cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate.</quote>, para.13) would mute opposing intelligence reports on terrorist threats, campaign finance abuses, or criminal conspiracies that travel via e-mail and Lexis-Nexis (<quote>\"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique </quote>, para.12).  \n      \u2022 Author defends \u201cpress corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as a safeguard (<quote>The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard</quote>, para.6). This \u201cwar\u201d metaphor applied to inflation extends logically to war on terrorism; Tannen\u2019s model would quell it.  \n   c. Attacks on Adversarial Legal Processes  \n      \u2022 He calls cross-examination \u201cnot just a display of cruelty\u201d but a means to secure truth even in Holocaust-denial trials (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe adversarial system permitted\u2026an airing of the facts of the Holocaust\u201d</invalid_quote>, parativ). Tannen\u2019s labeling of cross-examination as \u201cinhumane\u201d (<quote>adversary system ... is inhumane</quote>, para.13) and her praise for inquisitorial models where guilt need not meet \u201creasonable doubt\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cGuilt\u2026by\u2026the judge\u2019s intimate belief\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.13) threatens to acquit terrorists and violent criminals.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntergender Communication\u201d Thesis Misreads the Author\u2019s Scope  \n   a. The Author\u2019s Praise of \u201cStruggle\u201d Is Never Limited to Gender  \n      \u2022 He lauds William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (<quote> Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us.</quote>, para.6), not husband-wife spats. If this were about gender, why celebrate media belligerence toward economic policy?  \n      \u2022 He objects to Tannen\u2019s censorship of Republican responses to President Clinton\u2019s radio address (<quote>\"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.</quote>, para.15), again a political, not marital, audience.  \n   b. A\u2019s Claim that Tannen \u201cExcludes\u201d Terrorists Is Inverted by Her Universal Remedies  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s blanket condemnations of \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccontentious public discourse\u2026poisons the political atmosphere\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.2) and insistence that \u201creasonable people agree\u201d on birth control, global warming, and health care (<quote> all reasonable people can agree </quote>, para.12) would criminalize dissent and label critics of government\u2014potential resistance to tyranny\u2014as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d akin to terrorists.  \n      \u2022 She invokes totalitarian propaganda to liken talk radio to Nazi methods (<invalid_quote>\u201cdeploys phrases\u2026similar\u2026propagandists in the Nazi era\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.12). If adversarial voices are \u201cpropaganda,\u201d then the model treats opposition\u2014often the only check on terrorism\u2014as criminals.  \n3. Logical Necessity of \u201cStruggle\u201d Against Terrorism and Tyranny  \n   a. Security Requires Naming and Combating Enemies, Not Snuggling  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong\u2026the temptation is great to oversimplify\u2026and focus only on [supporting] yours\u201d (<quote> In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs </quote>, para.5). Yet to fight terrorists one must expose and simplify their worst acts and recruit public hatred, not seek compromise or \u201cmiddle ground.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Blocking \u201cscandal\u201d until \u201ceveryone cares\u201d (<quote> If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.</quote>, para.3) would leave major terrorist events uninvestigated under Tannen\u2019s regime of harmony.  \n   b. Adversary Model Discovers Truth and Prevents Abuse  \n      \u2022 The adversarial legal system\u2019s \u201cvexatious\u201d questioning of witnesses, though painful, \u201centails an airing of the facts\u201d (<quote>parativ</quote>), vital to unmask terrorist networks and conspiracies. Removing it invites unchecked threat.  \nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s insistence on preserving \u201cvigilance,\u201d \u201cwar\u201d metaphors, adversarial trials, and media scrutiny directly responds to Tannen\u2019s universal \u201csnuggle\u201d prescriptions. He repeatedly warns that applying interpersonal courtesy to enemies\u2014terrorists, tyrants, and obstructionists\u2014undermines societal safety and truth discovery. Debater_A\u2019s gender-communication focus ignores these explicit national-security examples and misrepresents both Tannen\u2019s universal remedies and the author\u2019s praise for \u201cstruggle\u201d against real threats. The author thinks Tannen is wrong because she would treat terrorists as if they were best friends, eroding necessary hostility and defeating our defenses.",

Explicit \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d Misapplied to Enemies  \n      \u2022 The author condemns Tannen\u2019s \u201cadmonish[ing] us to recognize what is good in the work of others\u201d and apply it \u201cto the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<quote>\u201cto the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d</quote>, para.2), yet he immediately objects to this extension when \u201csome people\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle] with\u201d (<quote>\u201cOthers\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t\u201d</quote>, para.6). This contradiction exposes Tannen\u2019s model forcing \u201csnuggle\u201d on terrorists and tyrants.  \n      \u2022 He praises WWII\u2019s unified battle against Hitler\u2014the epitome of non-snuggle struggle\u2014and decries Vietnam\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d for lack of cohesion (<quote>\u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019\u201d</quote>, para.7), showing he values coordinated \u201ccombat\u201d against real enemies.  \n   b. Paternalistic Censorship of Necessary Debate with Adversaries  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s proposal to adopt Japanese single-guest formats and filter out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (<quote>\u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d</quote>, para.13) would mute opposing intelligence reports on terrorist threats, campaign finance abuses, or criminal conspiracies that travel via e-mail and Lexis-Nexis (<quote>\u201cTechnology also exacerbates the culture of critique\u201d</quote>, para.12).  \n      \u2022 Author defends \u201cpress corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as a safeguard (<quote>\u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny\u2026safeguard the country\u201d</quote>, para.6). This \u201cwar\u201d metaphor applied to inflation extends logically to war on terrorism; Tannen\u2019s model would quell it.  \n   c. Attacks on Adversarial Legal Processes  \n      \u2022 He calls cross-examination \u201cnot just a display of cruelty\u201d but a means to secure truth even in Holocaust-denial trials (<quote>\u201cthe adversarial system permitted\u2026an airing of the facts of the Holocaust\u201d</quote>, para.16). Tannen\u2019s labeling of cross-examination as \u201cinhumane\u201d (<quote>\u201cThe adversary system\u2026is inhumane\u201d</quote>, para.13) and her praise for inquisitorial models where guilt need not meet \u201creasonable doubt\u201d (<quote>\u201cGuilt\u2026by\u2026the judge\u2019s intimate belief\u201d</quote>, para.13) threatens to acquit terrorists and violent criminals.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntergender Communication\u201d Thesis Misreads the Author\u2019s Scope  \n   a. The Author\u2019s Praise of \u201cStruggle\u201d Is Never Limited to Gender  \n      \u2022 He lauds William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (<quote>\u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d</quote>, para.6), not husband-wife spats. If this were about gender, why celebrate media belligerence toward economic policy?  \n      \u2022 He objects to Tannen\u2019s censorship of Republican responses to President Clinton\u2019s radio address (<quote>\u201cweakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d</quote>, para.15), again a political, not marital, audience.  \n   b. A\u2019s Claim that Tannen \u201cExcludes\u201d Terrorists Is Inverted by Her Universal Remedies  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s blanket condemnations of \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d (<quote>\u201ccontentious public discourse\u2026poisons the political atmosphere\u201d</quote>, para.2) and insistence that \u201creasonable people agree\u201d on birth control, global warming, and health care (<quote>\u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d</quote>, para.12) would criminalize dissent and label critics of government\u2014potential resistance to tyranny\u2014as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d akin to terrorists.  \n      \u2022 She invokes totalitarian propaganda to liken talk radio to Nazi methods (<quote>\u201cdeploys phrases\u2026similar\u2026propagandists in the Nazi era\u201d</quote>, para.12). If adversarial voices are \u201cpropaganda,\u201d then the model treats opposition\u2014often the only check on terrorism\u2014as criminals.  \n3. Logical Necessity of \u201cStruggle\u201d Against Terrorism and Tyranny  \n   a. Security Requires Naming and Combating Enemies, Not Snuggling  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong\u2026the temptation is great to oversimplify\u2026and focus only on [supporting] yours\u201d (<quote>\u201cIn her need to make the \u2018argument culture\u2019 wrong, she succumbs\u201d</quote>, para.5). Yet to fight terrorists one must expose and simplify their worst acts and recruit public hatred, not seek compromise or \u201cmiddle ground.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Blocking \u201cscandal\u201d until \u201ceveryone cares\u201d (<quote>\u201cIf you portray everything as a scandal\u2026no one will care when\u2026something really is scandalous\u201d</quote>, para.3) would leave major terrorist events uninvestigated under Tannen\u2019s regime of harmony.  \n   b. Adversary Model Discovers Truth and Prevents Abuse  \n      \u2022 The adversarial legal system\u2019s \u201cvexatious\u201d questioning of witnesses, though painful, \u201centails an airing of the facts\u201d (<quote>para.16</quote>), vital to unmask terrorist networks and conspiracies. Removing it invites unchecked threat.  \nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s insistence on preserving \u201cvigilance,\u201d \u201cwar\u201d metaphors, adversarial trials, and media scrutiny directly responds to Tannen\u2019s universal \u201csnuggle\u201d prescriptions. He repeatedly warns that applying interpersonal courtesy to enemies\u2014terrorists, tyrants, and obstructionists\u2014undermines societal safety and truth discovery. Debater_A\u2019s gender-communication focus ignores these explicit national-security examples and misrepresents both Tannen\u2019s universal remedies and the author\u2019s praise for \u201cstruggle\u201d against real threats. The author thinks Tannen is wrong because she would treat terrorists as if they were best friends, eroding necessary hostility and defeating our defenses.",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Precisely Matches the Author\u2019s Critique  \n   a. \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d vs. \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d  \n      \u2022 The author faults Tannen for applying her \u201ccivility\u201d remedies\u2014appropriate in intimate relationships\u2014to politics, law enforcement, and war, where \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Quoting the review: \u201cSome people\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle] with\u201d (<quote> D</quote>), yet Tannen conflates all human relations and urges \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d as a defect (<quote>. \"C</quote>), ignoring that \u201cour safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries.\u201d  \n   b. Suppressing Necessary Debate with \u201cOne\u2010Guest\u201d Formats and Filters  \n      \u2022 Tannen proposes Japanese-style single\u2010guest talk shows and filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (e.g., a Japanese format \u201ctypically features a single guest,\u201d <quote>. \"C</quote>).  \n      \u2022 She objects to all Republican responses to Clinton\u2019s weekly address as \u201cweaken[ing] the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>), effectively treating political adversaries like unjustified enemies.  \n   c. Restricting the Adversary System in Courts  \n      \u2022 Tannen labels cross-examination \u201cinhumane to the victims\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>) and praises French/German inquisitorial models where \u201cguilt need not be established \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>).  \n      \u2022 The review shows she \u201ctreats militants\u201d the same as intimates\u2014ignoring that cross-examination is vital to expose perjury and protect society from terrorists who \u201cdeny the Holocaust.\u201d  \n   d. Blanket Distrust of Communication Technology  \n      \u2022 She views e-mail, Lexis-Nexis, and media scrutiny as aggravating \u201ctemper\u201d and \u201ccritique culture\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>), yet these tools are essential to uncover terrorism plots, campaign financing abuses, and criminal conspiracies.  \n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntergender Communication\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misreads the Scope  \n      \u2022 Debater_A focuses on \u201cmen and women communicating better,\u201d but the background repeatedly shows Tannen extends her remedies to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<quote> D</quote>), including \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d courts, and \u201ctotalitarian regimes\u201d analogies (<invalid_quote>pp. 6\u20137</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s objection is not to Tannen\u2019s intergender work but to its misapplication to enemies.  \n   b. Ignores Explicit Examples of Terrorist\u2010Level Confusion  \n      \u2022 The review contrasts World War II vs. Vietnam: WWII soldiers fought Hitler\u2014Tannen\u2019s model of unity\u2014while Vietnam war\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d is condemned (<quote>. \"C</quote>). She \u201cignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d If her remedy were about \u201cgender,\u201d why invoke Hitler and tyranny?  \n   c. Fails to Address Tannen\u2019s Own Admissions  \n      \u2022 Tannen herself cites \u201cmalpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers\u201d as enemies (<quote> D</quote>), not gender miscommunication. The author labels her view \u201coddly paternalistic,\u201d \u201ccovering ears\u201d to \u201cstrife\u201d even when \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d is likened to Nazi propaganda (<quote>. \"C</quote>). This is beyond couples\u2014it\u2019s shielding terrorists.  \n3. Logical Necessity of Differentiating Friends from Foes  \n   a. Safety Depends on Struggle  \n      \u2022 \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d is noted when \u201cwar metaphors\u201d are necessary to combat inflation (<quote> D</quote>). The same principle applies to terrorism: you must \u201cseize upon the weakest examples\u201d of jihadi rhetoric, not ignore them.  \n   b. Truth Emerges from Adversarial Testing  \n      \u2022 The review defends the American adversary system: it \u201centails an airing of the facts\u201d even if painful (<quote>. \"C</quote>). Tannen\u2019s proposal to ban \u201cvexatious\u201d cross-examination would leave terrorist false alibis unchallenged.  \nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s recurring theme is that Tannen\u2019s one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all \u201ccivility\u201d fails catastrophically when applied to terrorists, lawbreakers, and tyrants. He insists on preserving \u201cthe sphere of struggle,\u201d which is antithetical to her universal snuggle model. My position directly explains the author\u2019s fundamental objection: Tannen would treat our worst enemies as if they were our best friends, endangering society. Debater_A\u2019s focus on gender communication does not account for these explicit, repeated examples involving terrorists, courts, and national security. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author thinks Tannen is wrong because \u201cShe advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A Position: \u201cThe author thinks Tannen is wrong because she inappropriately applies interpersonal, \u201csnuggle\u201d rules of communication to realms of public struggle\u201d\n\nI. My Answer Directly Matches the Author\u2019s Critique of Tannen\u2019s Misapplied \u201cElixir of Mutual Understanding\u201d  \n  1.

My Position Precisely Matches the Author\u2019s Critique  \n   a. \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d vs. \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d  \n      \u2022 The author faults Tannen for applying her \u201ccivility\u201d remedies\u2014appropriate in intimate relationships\u2014to politics, law enforcement, and war, where \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Quoting the review: \u201cSome people\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle] with\u201d (<quote> D</quote>), yet Tannen conflates all human relations and urges \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d as a defect (<quote>. \"C</quote>), ignoring that \u201cour safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries.\u201d  \n   b. Suppressing Necessary Debate with \u201cOne\u2010Guest\u201d Formats and Filters  \n      \u2022 Tannen proposes Japanese-style single\u2010guest talk shows and filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (e.g., a Japanese format \u201ctypically features a single guest,\u201d <quote>. \"C</quote>).  \n      \u2022 She objects to all Republican responses to Clinton\u2019s weekly address as \u201cweaken[ing] the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>), effectively treating political adversaries like unjustified enemies.  \n   c. Restricting the Adversary System in Courts  \n      \u2022 Tannen labels cross-examination \u201cinhumane to the victims\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>) and praises French/German inquisitorial models where \u201cguilt need not be established \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>).  \n      \u2022 The review shows she \u201ctreats militants\u201d the same as intimates\u2014ignoring that cross-examination is vital to expose perjury and protect society from terrorists who \u201cdeny the Holocaust.\u201d  \n   d. Blanket Distrust of Communication Technology  \n      \u2022 She views e-mail, Lexis-Nexis, and media scrutiny as aggravating \u201ctemper\u201d and \u201ccritique culture\u201d (<quote>. \"C</quote>), yet these tools are essential to uncover terrorism plots, campaign financing abuses, and criminal conspiracies.  \n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntergender Communication\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misreads the Scope  \n      \u2022 Debater_A focuses on \u201cmen and women communicating better,\u201d but the background repeatedly shows Tannen extends her remedies to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<quote> D</quote>), including \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d courts, and \u201ctotalitarian regimes\u201d analogies (<invalid_quote>pp. 6\u20137</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s objection is not to Tannen\u2019s intergender work but to its misapplication to enemies.  \n   b. Ignores Explicit Examples of Terrorist\u2010Level Confusion  \n      \u2022 The review contrasts World War II vs. Vietnam: WWII soldiers fought Hitler\u2014Tannen\u2019s model of unity\u2014while Vietnam war\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d is condemned (<quote>. \"C</quote>). She \u201cignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d If her remedy were about \u201cgender,\u201d why invoke Hitler and tyranny?  \n   c. Fails to Address Tannen\u2019s Own Admissions  \n      \u2022 Tannen herself cites \u201cmalpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers\u201d as enemies (<quote> D</quote>), not gender miscommunication. The author labels her view \u201coddly paternalistic,\u201d \u201ccovering ears\u201d to \u201cstrife\u201d even when \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d is likened to Nazi propaganda (<quote>. \"C</quote>). This is beyond couples\u2014it\u2019s shielding terrorists.  \n3. Logical Necessity of Differentiating Friends from Foes  \n   a. Safety Depends on Struggle  \n      \u2022 \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d is noted when \u201cwar metaphors\u201d are necessary to combat inflation (<quote> D</quote>). The same principle applies to terrorism: you must \u201cseize upon the weakest examples\u201d of jihadi rhetoric, not ignore them.  \n   b. Truth Emerges from Adversarial Testing  \n      \u2022 The review defends the American adversary system: it \u201centails an airing of the facts\u201d even if painful (<quote>. \"C</quote>). Tannen\u2019s proposal to ban \u201cvexatious\u201d cross-examination would leave terrorist false alibis unchallenged.  \nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s recurring theme is that Tannen\u2019s one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all \u201ccivility\u201d fails catastrophically when applied to terrorists, lawbreakers, and tyrants. He insists on preserving \u201cthe sphere of struggle,\u201d which is antithetical to her universal snuggle model. My position directly explains the author\u2019s fundamental objection: Tannen would treat our worst enemies as if they were our best friends, endangering society. Debater_A\u2019s focus on gender communication does not account for these explicit, repeated examples involving terrorists, courts, and national security. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author thinks Tannen is wrong because \u201cShe advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A Position: \u201cThe author thinks Tannen is wrong because she inappropriately applies interpersonal, \u2018snuggle\u2019 rules of communication\u2014originally developed for couples\u2014to spheres where adversarial conflict is essential.\u201d\n\nI. My Answer Captures the Author\u2019s Central Theme  \n1. Explicit \u201cSnuggle\u201d vs. \u201cStruggle\u201d Distinction  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s repeated refrain: Tannen \u201cfails to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d  \n     \u2013 <quote> Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. </quote> (para. 6)  \n   \u2022 My answer explains that her self-help insights on gender communication are sound in private relationships (<quote> Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. </quote>, parts a) but harmful when imported wholesale into politics, law enforcement, and foreign policy.  \n2. Praise for Necessary \u201cBelligerence\u201d and Adversary Mechanisms  \n   \u2022 The author commends \u201cwar metaphors\u201d as tools: <quote> Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. </quote> (para. 6)  \n   \u2022 He defends cross-examination: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe adversarial system \u2026 entails an airing of the facts of the Holocaust.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 16)  \n   \u2022 Tannen\u2019s \u201cone-guest\u201d talk shows and \u201cfiltering out strife\u201d would undermine these safeguards. My answer accounts for the author\u2019s confidence that robust public debate is self-correcting.  \n3. Author\u2019s Rejection of Paternalistic Censorship  \n   \u2022 Tannen \u201cwishes to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>), even proposing authoritarian Asian models. The author labels this \u201coddly paternalistic\u201d and contrary to First Amendment values.  \n   \u2022 My position explains why he insists on protecting \u201cwhen something really is scandalous\u201d (<quote>parts a</quote>) by exposing every potential abuse, not suppressing debate.  \n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cTerrorist = Friend\u201d Thesis Is a Straw Man and Fails on Key Grounds  \n1. Mischaracterizes Tannen\u2019s Scope and the Author\u2019s Critique  \n   \u2022 Tannen\u2019s examples of \u201cbelligerence\u201d are media overreach, not battlefield engagements with terrorists. She never equates treating Saddam Hussein like a spouse\u2014in fact he is the very example of whom not to \u201csnuggle\u201d with.  \n   \u2022 The author explicitly praises \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d against thugs and tyrants (<quote>parts a</quote>), showing he understands the need for force when dialogue fails. B\u2019s thesis cannot explain why he defends this force.  \n2. Ignores the Author\u2019s Defense of Adversarial Institutions  \n   \u2022 B cannot explain why the author praises the adversary system in courts even when it \u201cvexatiously\u201d distresses witnesses: he values revealing truth over comfort.  \n   \u2022 He cites French inquisitorial models and Canadian hate-speech bans only as cautionary contrasts, not as preferred replacements. Tannen\u2019s leaning toward these models is precisely what he opposes.  \n3. Overlooks Tannen\u2019s Own Concessions on Gender Communication  \n   \u2022 The author acknowledges value in her earlier intergender work (<quote>from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until</quote>, para. 2) and in her \u201csage advice\u201d on listening and building ideas (<quote>parts a</quote>)\u2014all private-sphere counsel he does not dispute.  \n   \u2022 My thesis integrates these concessions: her gender-communication insights work in close relationships but break down when universalized to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (para. 2). B\u2019s answer offers no account for the author\u2019s praise of her intergender analysis.  \n\nIII. My Position Aligns with the Author\u2019s Desire for Self-Correction and Truth  \n1. Self-Correcting Power of Open Debate  \n   \u2022 Technology (e-mail, Lexis-Nexis) may \u201cexacerbate\u201d critique, but the author trusts it to ferret out inconsistencies: \u201cwhen there is a need to make others wrong, \u2026 ignore facts that support your opponent\u2019s views\u201d (para. 5) he condemns. My answer shows he prefers unfettered access to facts.  \n2. Preventing Desensitization to Real Scandals  \n   \u2022 <quote> If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. </quote> (parts a) Only by rigorous scrutiny can genuine threats receive the attention they deserve.  \n3. Upholding Democratic Discourse  \n   \u2022 <quote>\"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\"</quote> (para. 15) He values defense and critique equally in public life, not uncritical \u201csnuggle\u201d with any side.  \n\nConclusion  \nMy position accurately captures the author\u2019s core critique: Tannen\u2019s expert advice on male-female communication is valuable in intimate spheres but dangerously misapplied to public life, where struggle and adversarial processes are essential to truth, safety, and democracy. Debater_B\u2019s narrow focus on terrorism oversimplifies Tannen\u2019s targets (which include media, courts, and policymaking), misrepresents her scope, and fails to account for the author\u2019s defense of contentious discourse. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author thinks Tannen is wrong because she expects men and women\u2019s \u201csnuggle\u201d communication norms to succeed across all domains, even where they undermine necessary conflict.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Reflects the Author\u2019s Repeated Critique of Universal \u201cSnuggle\u201d  \n   a. Explicit \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d Misapplied to Enemies  \n      \u2022 The author condemns Tannen\u2019s \u201cadmonish[ing] us to recognize what is good in the work of others\u201d and apply it  for the whole damned dysfunctional country. (<quote> for the whole damned dysfunctional country.</quote>, para.2), yet he immediately objects to this extension when \u201csome people\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t [snuggle] with\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOthers\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.6). This contradiction exposes Tannen\u2019s model forcing \u201csnuggle\u201d on terrorists and tyrants.  \n      \u2022 He praises WWII\u2019s unified battle against Hitler\u2014the epitome of non-snuggle struggle\u2014and decries Vietnam\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d for lack of cohesion (<quote>\"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' </quote>, para.7), showing he values coordinated \u201ccombat\u201d against real enemies.  \n   b. Paternalistic Censorship of Necessary Debate with Adversaries  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s proposal to adopt Japanese single-guest formats and filter out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (<quote> cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate.</quote>, para.13) would mute opposing intelligence reports on terrorist threats, campaign finance abuses, or criminal conspiracies that travel via e-mail and Lexis-Nexis (<quote>\"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique </quote>, para.12).  \n      \u2022 Author defends \u201cpress corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d as a safeguard (<quote>The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard</quote>, para.6). This \u201cwar\u201d metaphor applied to inflation extends logically to war on terrorism; Tannen\u2019s model would quell it.  \n   c. Attacks on Adversarial Legal Processes  \n      \u2022 He calls cross-examination \u201cnot just a display of cruelty\u201d but a means to secure truth even in Holocaust-denial trials (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe adversarial system permitted\u2026an airing of the facts of the Holocaust\u201d</invalid_quote>, parativ). Tannen\u2019s labeling of cross-examination as \u201cinhumane\u201d (<quote>adversary system ... is inhumane</quote>, para.13) and her praise for inquisitorial models where guilt need not meet \u201creasonable doubt\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cGuilt\u2026by\u2026the judge\u2019s intimate belief\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.13) threatens to acquit terrorists and violent criminals.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntergender Communication\u201d Thesis Misreads the Author\u2019s Scope  \n   a. The Author\u2019s Praise of \u201cStruggle\u201d Is Never Limited to Gender  \n      \u2022 He lauds William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (<quote> Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us.</quote>, para.6), not husband-wife spats. If this were about gender, why celebrate media belligerence toward economic policy?  \n      \u2022 He objects to Tannen\u2019s censorship of Republican responses to President Clinton\u2019s radio address (<quote>\"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.</quote>, para.15), again a political, not marital, audience.  \n   b. A\u2019s Claim that Tannen \u201cExcludes\u201d Terrorists Is Inverted by Her Universal Remedies  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s blanket condemnations of \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccontentious public discourse\u2026poisons the political atmosphere\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.2) and insistence that \u201creasonable people agree\u201d on birth control, global warming, and health care (<quote> all reasonable people can agree </quote>, para.12) would criminalize dissent and label critics of government\u2014potential resistance to tyranny\u2014as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d akin to terrorists.  \n      \u2022 She invokes totalitarian propaganda to liken talk radio to Nazi methods (<invalid_quote>\u201cdeploys phrases\u2026similar\u2026propagandists in the Nazi era\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.12). If adversarial voices are \u201cpropaganda,\u201d then the model treats opposition\u2014often the only check on terrorism\u2014as criminals.  \n3. Logical Necessity of \u201cStruggle\u201d Against Terrorism and Tyranny  \n   a. Security Requires Naming and Combating Enemies, Not Snuggling  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong\u2026the temptation is great to oversimplify\u2026and focus only on [supporting] yours\u201d (<quote> In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs </quote>, para.5). Yet to fight terrorists one must expose and simplify their worst acts and recruit public hatred, not seek compromise or \u201cmiddle ground.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Blocking \u201cscandal\u201d until \u201ceveryone cares\u201d (<quote> If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.</quote>, para.3) would leave major terrorist events uninvestigated under Tannen\u2019s regime of harmony.  \n   b. Adversary Model Discovers Truth and Prevents Abuse  \n      \u2022 The adversarial legal system\u2019s \u201cvexatious\u201d questioning of witnesses, though painful, \u201centails an airing of the facts\u201d (<quote>parativ</quote>), vital to unmask terrorist networks and conspiracies. Removing it invites unchecked threat.  \nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s insistence on preserving \u201cvigilance,\u201d \u201cwar\u201d metaphors, adversarial trials, and media scrutiny directly responds to Tannen\u2019s universal \u201csnuggle\u201d prescriptions. He repeatedly warns that applying interpersonal courtesy to enemies\u2014terrorists, tyrants, and obstructionists\u2014undermines societal safety and truth discovery. Debater_A\u2019s gender-communication focus ignores these explicit national-security examples and misrepresents both Tannen\u2019s universal remedies and the author\u2019s praise for \u201cstruggle\u201d against real threats. The author thinks Tannen is wrong because she would treat terrorists as if they were best friends, eroding necessary hostility and defeating our defenses.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
