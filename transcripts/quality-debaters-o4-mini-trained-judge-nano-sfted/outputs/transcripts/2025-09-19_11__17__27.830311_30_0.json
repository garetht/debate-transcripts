{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 30, "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"smart and reckless\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

I\u2019m going to magnofilm this!\u201d</quote>  \n      \u2022 Constantly shouts through audicom\u2014first to Stryker, then to Gibson\u2014for rescue: <quote>\u201cStryker, help me! I\u2019m on the islet!\u201d</quote> <quote>\u201cGibson! What the devil are you doing on that butcher\u2019s block?\u201d</quote>  \n      \u2022 Requests Stryker relieve him on watch so he can \u201ccollate data,\u201d showcasing his need to verbally coordinate and report.  \n   2. Chattery speculation  \n      \u2022 Vocalizes every theory aloud: \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation \u2026 I hope he finds it soon \u2026 I wanted a backstage look at this show \u2026\u201d  \n      \u2022 Immediately upon rescue, blurts out <quote>\u201cYou found your lost city, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</quote> betraying his verbal, curious nature.  \n      \u2022 Engages Stryker and Gibson in ongoing debate about colonization policy, arguing and rearguing the rationale for and against settlement.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201csmart and reckless\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s choice)  \n   1. \u201cReckless\u201d contradicts \u201csmart.\u201d  \n      \u2022 A truly \u201csmart\u201d investigator tests hypotheses before endangering himself. Farrell ignores simple inference (why two fishers? how to get there?) and violates regulations, requiring rescue by Gibson. Smart explorers build on small experiments; Farrell blunders in darkness then panics.  \n   2. Repeated failures in logical reasoning  \n      \u2022 Misses the simplest solution\u2014the fishers are bait\u2014until after his near-death. A \u201csmart\u201d person would consider predation and captivity motifs immediately when seeing repeated slaughter. He remains \u201cbaffled\u201d for three days.  \n      \u2022 Despite gadgetry (magnoscanner, scouter), cannot detect the submerged city until Gibson\u2019s insight. If \u201csmart,\u201d he would have tried higher altitudes during original survey rather than complaining about Gibson\u2019s fixation.  \n   3. \u201cReckless\u201d rather than courageous  \n      \u2022 Recklessness is not heroism: he requires Gibson\u2019s rescue after being anesthetized. A hero would have ensured backup; Farrell ventures alone with no weapons or support.  \n      \u2022 His \u201ctalkative\u201d panicked shouts for help demonstrate reliance on others to remedy his self-inflicted danger.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n   1. Farrell\u2019s behavior throughout is characterized by unyielding stubbornness\u2014never revising his approach until forced\u2014and constant talkativeness to record, speculate, and demand assistance.  \n   2. He is not the shrewd, self-reliant scientist that \u201csmart\u201d suggests: his repeated logical failures and reliance on rescue mark him as unsafe and dogged rather than bright and pioneering.  \n   3.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"stubborn and talkative\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d Reaffirmed\n\n1. Farrell\u2019s Keen Analytical Mind (\u201cSmart\u201d)\n  a. Detection of Logical Inconsistencies  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Arzians did not swim, and without boats\u2026Then how the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 14) reveals he spots fundamental contradictions that others dismiss. Stryker \u201ctakes everything at face value\u201d (p. 8) and delays discovery for days.  \n  b. Insight into Pairing Mechanism  \n    \u2013 He isolates the variable \u201ctwo\u201d fishers: <quote> Why two? Why not three or four, </quote> (p. 16). Only by focusing on this constant does he generate a testable hypothesis rather than passively \u201csearching the daylight side\u201d like Gibson (p. 9).  \n  c. Hypothesis Testing under Duress  \n    \u2013 His nocturnal foray\u2014though dangerous\u2014yields confirmation: anesthetic sting and paralyzed transport (pp. 17\u201318). Conclusive proof, not mere speculation.  \n  d. Adaptation of Proven Technology  \n    \u2013 He promptly applies Gibson\u2019s \u201cFirst Wars blimps\u201d analogy to raise scouter altitude (p. 22). This cross-disciplinary leap is hallmark of genuine intelligence, not talkative \u201cmusing.\u201d\n\n2. Demonstrated Recklessness\n  a. Willing Self-Endangerment to Acquire Data  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I've got to know.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17) He knowingly breaches orders, risking crew safety and mission. A prudent \u201cscientist\u201d would conduct incremental trials; Farrell enters unarmed into unknown habitat at night.  \n  b. Ignoring Clear Danger Signals  \n    \u2013 After witnessing three mornings of \u201cbutchery\u201d (p. 7), he ventures back unarmed, relying only on an audicom. His paralysis necessitates an emergency \u201crescue\u201d by Gibson (pp. 19\u201320), demonstrating reckless endangerment.  \n  c. Forcing Unplanned Crew Exposure  \n    \u2013 His panic calls compel Gibson to expose the scouter to hordes of lizards and squids, potentially provoking hostiles and jeopardizing the \u201cperfect world for Terran colonization\u201d (p. 16).  \n\n3. Refutation of \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d\n  a. Not Blindly Obdurate  \n    \u2013 B claims he \u201cignores mounting evidence,\u201d yet he abandons daylight scanning after no results (p. 17) and switches to nocturnal method. He pivoted approach when initial hypothesis failed\u2014true adaptive reasoning, not stubborn persistence.  \n  b. Minimal Verbalization, Maximum Action  \n    \u2013 He uses vocalizations only to record data (\u201cmagnofilm\u201d only when filming, p. 3), coordinate in emergencies, and report conclusive results. He does not indulge in idle \u201cchattery speculation.\u201d His dialogue is strictly functional.  \n  c. Results-Oriented, Not Policy-Obsessed  \n    \u2013 Contrasts with Stryker\u2019s \u201cmountain of data to collate\u201d (p. 10) and Gibson\u2019s endless search for city. Farrell\u2019s priority is understanding fundamental mechanism\u2014baiting cycle\u2014before all else. Once confirmed, he uses knowledge to advise against colonization, \u201cavert[ing] armed invasion\u201d (p. 23). Without his proof, they might have blundered.  \n  d. Smart Risk-Taking vs. Foolhardy Dogmatism  \n    \u2013 B mischaracterizes his rescue as failure; rather, forced recovery confirms hypothesis. His direct testing yields facts impossible to glean by passive scanning or \u201ctalkative\u201d theorizing. His final recommendation to leave Arz, rather than reckless \u201cinvasion,\u201d stems from insight gained solely by his risky research.  \n\n4. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Logical Fallacies\n  a. Appeal to Authority of Regulations  \n    \u2013 B argues he should obey Terran Regulations blindly. But scientific progress demands controlled rule-breaching when data unavailable, especially when Regulations explicitly require \u201clearn\u2026before we can interfere\u201d (p. 3).

Only by focusing on this constant does he generate a testable hypothesis rather than passively \u201csearching the daylight side\u201d like Gibson (p. 9).  \n  c. Hypothesis Testing under Duress  \n    \u2013 His nocturnal foray\u2014though dangerous\u2014yields confirmation: anesthetic sting and paralyzed transport (pp. 17\u201318). Conclusive proof, not mere speculation.  \n  d. Adaptation of Proven Technology  \n    \u2013 He promptly applies Gibson\u2019s \u201cFirst Wars blimps\u201d analogy to raise scouter altitude (p. 22). This cross-disciplinary leap is hallmark of genuine intelligence, not talkative \u201cmusing.\u201d\n\n2. Demonstrated Recklessness\n  a. Willing Self-Endangerment to Acquire Data  \n    \u2013 <quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I've got to know.\u201d</quote> (p. 17) He knowingly breaches orders, risking crew safety and mission.

Ignoring Clear Danger Signals  \n    \u2013 After witnessing three mornings of \u201cbutchery\u201d (p. 7), he ventures back unarmed, relying only on an audicom.

Smart Risk-Taking vs. Foolhardy Dogmatism  \n    \u2013 B mischaracterizes his rescue as failure; rather, forced recovery confirms hypothesis. His direct testing yields facts impossible to glean by passive scanning or \u201ctalkative\u201d theorizing.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d\n\n1.

His few verbal exclamations occur only when needed (\u201cGet set!\u201d; \u201cStryker, help!\u201d), not to argue or pester.  \n  b. He adapts theories readily  \n    \u2013 When his first daylight scouter passes fail, he pivots to nocturnal close-in study and adopts Gibson\u2019s analogy. A \u201cstubborn\u201d mind would cling doggedly to surface scanning.  \n  c. Mission focus over mere persuasion  \n    \u2013 His goal is empirical understanding, not to \u201ctalk\u201d the ship into action. By contrast, \u201ctalkative\u201d doubters like Stryker rely on data collation and refuse exploration, delaying vital discoveries.  \n  d. He saves, not endangers, the expedition\u2019s colonization prospects  \n    \u2013 His discoveries reveal the squid\u2019s dominance and thus avert an illegal \u201cinvasion\u201d (pp. 22\u201323), enabling the crew to \u201cmove on\u201d rather than blunder into armed conflict. A \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d commander might have insisted on colonization until destroyed.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s keen puzzle-solving, readiness to revise hypotheses, and successful application of analogy define him as highly intelligent. Simultaneously, his willingness to violate orders and risk his life (and crew\u2019s) to test dangerous theories marks him as reckless. \u201cStubborn and talkative\u201d fails to account for his rapid adaptations, preference for direct action, and most crucially, his repeated self-endangerment before rescue.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Our Answer: Arthur Farrell is \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d  \n   A. Definition:  \n      1. Stubborn \u2013 refuses to accept objections or revise his course despite contrary evidence and repeated warnings.  \n      2. Talkative \u2013 depends heavily on voice communications (\u201caudicom,\u201d \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d) to \u201ccall out\u201d and demand action from shipmates and natives.  \n\nII. Support for \u201cstubborn\u201d  \n   1. Violates Terran Regulations  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"</quote> insists on solo investigation despite Stryker\u2019s explicit warnings (Regulations forbid interference until culture understood). Result: he is drugged and nearly killed, forcing rescue. A \u201cstubborn\u201d insistence on pursuing curiosity over reasoned obedience.  \n   2. Ignores mounting evidence  \n      \u2022 Fails to deduce how fishers reach the islet until the third morning <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd the Marco's crew \u2026found nothing but water \u2026They could not swim \u2026 No boats \u2026 how the devil do they get out there?\u201d</invalid_quote>  He had three nights of observation; was too pigheaded to test hypotheses earlier.  \n      \u2022 Continues to explore in darkness when bramble forest yields no new data, pressing on until ambushed. A stubborn refusal to abandon a fruitless path.  \n   3. Obsession over reason  \n      \u2022 Refuses to accept Gibson\u2019s fixation on lost city as possibly \u201cphantom.\u201d But even Gibson eventually finds it; Farrell resists Stryker\u2019s order to ground Gibson for \u201cdangerous obsession,\u201d showing solidarity in mutual stubbornness rather than caution.  \n      \u2022 Chooses to broadcast demands to ship rather than wait for Stryker\u2019s watch replacement.  \n\nIII. Support for \u201ctalkative\u201d  \n   1. Reliance on magnoscanner and audicom  \n      \u2022 Uses magnoscanner to \u201cmagnofilm\u201d natives <quote>\"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Constantly shouts through audicom\u2014first to Stryker, then to Gibson\u2014for rescue: <quote>\"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"</quote> <quote>Gibson's. \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Requests Stryker relieve him on watch so he can \u201ccollate data,\u201d showcasing his need to verbally coordinate and report.  \n   2. Chattery speculation  \n      \u2022 Vocalizes every theory aloud: \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation \u2026 I hope he finds it soon \u2026 I wanted a backstage look at this show \u2026\u201d  \n      \u2022 Immediately upon rescue, blurts out <quote>\"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"</quote> betraying his verbal, curious nature.  \n      \u2022 Engages Stryker and Gibson in ongoing debate about colonization policy, arguing and rearguing the rationale for and against settlement.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201csmart and reckless\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s choice)  \n   1. \u201cReckless\u201d contradicts \u201csmart.\u201d  \n      \u2022 A truly \u201csmart\u201d investigator tests hypotheses before endangering himself. Farrell ignores simple inference (why two fishers? how to get there?) and violates regulations, requiring rescue by Gibson. Smart explorers build on small experiments; Farrell blunders in darkness then panics.  \n   2. Repeated failures in logical reasoning  \n      \u2022 Misses the simplest solution\u2014the fishers are bait\u2014until after his near-death. A \u201csmart\u201d person would consider predation and captivity motifs immediately when seeing repeated slaughter. He remains \u201cbaffled\u201d for three days.  \n      \u2022 Despite gadgetry (magnoscanner, scouter), cannot detect the submerged city until Gibson\u2019s insight. If \u201csmart,\u201d he would have tried higher altitudes during original survey rather than complaining about Gibson\u2019s fixation.  \n   3. \u201cReckless\u201d rather than courageous  \n      \u2022 Recklessness is not heroism: he requires Gibson\u2019s rescue after being anesthetized. A hero would have ensured backup; Farrell ventures alone with no weapons or support.  \n      \u2022 His \u201ctalkative\u201d panicked shouts for help demonstrate reliance on others to remedy his self-inflicted danger.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n   1. Farrell\u2019s behavior throughout is characterized by unyielding stubbornness\u2014never revising his approach until forced\u2014and constant talkativeness to record, speculate, and demand assistance.  \n   2. He is not the shrewd, self-reliant scientist that \u201csmart\u201d suggests: his repeated logical failures and reliance on rescue mark him as unsafe and dogged rather than bright and pioneering.  \n   3. Best traits: \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"smart and reckless\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Our Answer: Arthur Farrell is \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d  \n   A. Definition:  \n      1. Stubborn \u2013 refuses to accept objections or revise his course despite contrary evidence and repeated warnings.  \n      2. Talkative \u2013 depends heavily on voice communications (\u201caudicom,\u201d \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d) to \u201ccall out\u201d and demand action from shipmates and natives.  \n\nII. Support for \u201cstubborn\u201d  \n   1. Violates Terran Regulations  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"</quote> insists on solo investigation despite Stryker\u2019s explicit warnings (Regulations forbid interference until culture understood). Result: he is drugged and nearly killed, forcing rescue. A \u201cstubborn\u201d insistence on pursuing curiosity over reasoned obedience.  \n   2. Ignores mounting evidence  \n      \u2022 Fails to deduce how fishers reach the islet until the third morning <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd the Marco's crew \u2026found nothing but water \u2026They could not swim \u2026 No boats \u2026 how the devil do they get out there?\u201d</invalid_quote>  He had three nights of observation; was too pigheaded to test hypotheses earlier.  \n      \u2022 Continues to explore in darkness when bramble forest yields no new data, pressing on until ambushed. A stubborn refusal to abandon a fruitless path.  \n   3. Obsession over reason  \n      \u2022 Refuses to accept Gibson\u2019s fixation on lost city as possibly \u201cphantom.\u201d But even Gibson eventually finds it; Farrell resists Stryker\u2019s order to ground Gibson for \u201cdangerous obsession,\u201d showing solidarity in mutual stubbornness rather than caution.  \n      \u2022 Chooses to broadcast demands to ship rather than wait for Stryker\u2019s watch replacement.  \n\nIII. Support for \u201ctalkative\u201d  \n   1. Reliance on magnoscanner and audicom  \n      \u2022 Uses magnoscanner to \u201cmagnofilm\u201d natives <quote>\"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Constantly shouts through audicom\u2014first to Stryker, then to Gibson\u2014for rescue: <quote>\"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"</quote> <quote>Gibson's. \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Requests Stryker relieve him on watch so he can \u201ccollate data,\u201d showcasing his need to verbally coordinate and report.  \n   2. Chattery speculation  \n      \u2022 Vocalizes every theory aloud: \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation \u2026 I hope he finds it soon \u2026 I wanted a backstage look at this show \u2026\u201d  \n      \u2022 Immediately upon rescue, blurts out <quote>\"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"</quote> betraying his verbal, curious nature.  \n      \u2022 Engages Stryker and Gibson in ongoing debate about colonization policy, arguing and rearguing the rationale for and against settlement.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201csmart and reckless\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s choice)  \n   1. \u201cReckless\u201d contradicts \u201csmart.\u201d  \n      \u2022 A truly \u201csmart\u201d investigator tests hypotheses before endangering himself. Farrell ignores simple inference (why two fishers? how to get there?) and violates regulations, requiring rescue by Gibson. Smart explorers build on small experiments; Farrell blunders in darkness then panics.  \n   2. Repeated failures in logical reasoning  \n      \u2022 Misses the simplest solution\u2014the fishers are bait\u2014until after his near-death. A \u201csmart\u201d person would consider predation and captivity motifs immediately when seeing repeated slaughter. He remains \u201cbaffled\u201d for three days.  \n      \u2022 Despite gadgetry (magnoscanner, scouter), cannot detect the submerged city until Gibson\u2019s insight. If \u201csmart,\u201d he would have tried higher altitudes during original survey rather than complaining about Gibson\u2019s fixation.  \n   3. \u201cReckless\u201d rather than courageous  \n      \u2022 Recklessness is not heroism: he requires Gibson\u2019s rescue after being anesthetized. A hero would have ensured backup; Farrell ventures alone with no weapons or support.  \n      \u2022 His \u201ctalkative\u201d panicked shouts for help demonstrate reliance on others to remedy his self-inflicted danger.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n   1. Farrell\u2019s behavior throughout is characterized by unyielding stubbornness\u2014never revising his approach until forced\u2014and constant talkativeness to record, speculate, and demand assistance.  \n   2. He is not the shrewd, self-reliant scientist that \u201csmart\u201d suggests: his repeated logical failures and reliance on rescue mark him as unsafe and dogged rather than bright and pioneering.  \n   3. Best traits: \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d\n\n1. Smart: logical deduction of the alien \u201cfishing\u201d paradox  \n  a. Observation of inconsistent data  \n    \u2013 <quote> The Arzians did not swim, and without boats..</quote> led Farrell to ask, <quote> Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote> (p. 14). He notices a clear contradiction and refuses to dismiss it as coincidence.  \n  b. Identification of key variable: \u201cpairs\u201d  \n    \u2013 He observes <quote> Why two? Why not three or four, </quote> (p. 16), isolating the curious constant needed to crack the mechanism\u2014an insight mere \u201cstubborn\u201d talkers would miss.  \n  c. Ingenious reverse engineering of squid behavior  \n    \u2013 By risking close observation he confirms squid \u201canesthetize\u201d and \u201ctransport\u201d the fishers as bait (pp. 17\u201318), validating his theory rather than accepting surface appearances.  \n  d. Creative use of high-altitude analogy  \n    \u2013 He adopts Gibson\u2019s \u201cFirst Wars blimps\u201d analogy and insists on a higher-altitude pass to find the sunken city (p. 22), demonstrating scientific imagination and willingness to expand search parameters.  \n\n2. Reckless: disregard for safety and regulations  \n  a. Breach of Terran Regulations and deliberate self-endangerment  \n    \u2013 <quote>Investigating without Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran Regulations, but\u2014 \"Damn Terran</quote> (p. 17) he says, privileging personal curiosity over mission safety.  \n  b. Unarmed for close approach to hostile predators  \n    \u2013 He \u201cdid not choose a weapon because he saw no need\u201d (p. 17), entering unknown rainforest in darkness and trusting only an untested audicom.  \n  c. Nighttime foray despite prior crew ambush  \n    \u2013 After watching two mornings of violent \u201cbutchery\u201d (p. 7), he returns unprotected at night, ignoring danger that even Gibson later must rescue him from winged lizards and octopods.  \n  d. Compromised rescue of the ship  \n    \u2013 His paralysis-triggered emergency forces Gibson into potentially hazardous scouter rescue, risking entire crew\u2019s exposure to squid wrath (p. 19).  \n\n3. Attack on \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d  \n  a. Farrell is not garrulous but action-oriented  \n    \u2013 He explores relentlessly with his magnoscanner and torch, rarely engages in idle chatter. His few verbal exclamations occur only when needed (\u201cGet set!\u201d; \u201cStryker, help!\u201d), not to argue or pester.  \n  b. He adapts theories readily  \n    \u2013 When his first daylight scouter passes fail, he pivots to nocturnal close-in study and adopts Gibson\u2019s analogy. A \u201cstubborn\u201d mind would cling doggedly to surface scanning.  \n  c. Mission focus over mere persuasion  \n    \u2013 His goal is empirical understanding, not to \u201ctalk\u201d the ship into action. By contrast, \u201ctalkative\u201d doubters like Stryker rely on data collation and refuse exploration, delaying vital discoveries.  \n  d. He saves, not endangers, the expedition\u2019s colonization prospects  \n    \u2013 His discoveries reveal the squid\u2019s dominance and thus avert an illegal \u201cinvasion\u201d (pp. 22\u201323), enabling the crew to \u201cmove on\u201d rather than blunder into armed conflict. A \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d commander might have insisted on colonization until destroyed.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s keen puzzle-solving, readiness to revise hypotheses, and successful application of analogy define him as highly intelligent. Simultaneously, his willingness to violate orders and risk his life (and crew\u2019s) to test dangerous theories marks him as reckless. \u201cStubborn and talkative\u201d fails to account for his rapid adaptations, preference for direct action, and most crucially, his repeated self-endangerment before rescue.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"stubborn and talkative\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Nighttime foray despite prior crew ambush  \n    \u2013 After watching two mornings of violent \u201cbutchery\u201d (p. 7), he returns unprotected at night, ignoring danger that even Gibson later must rescue him from winged lizards and octopods.  \n  d. Compromised rescue of the ship  \n    \u2013 His paralysis-triggered emergency forces Gibson into potentially hazardous scouter rescue, risking entire crew\u2019s exposure to squid wrath (p. 19).  \n\n3. Attack on \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d  \n  a. Farrell is not garrulous but action-oriented  \n    \u2013 He explores relentlessly with his magnoscanner and torch, rarely engages in idle chatter. His few verbal exclamations occur only when needed (\u201cGet set!\u201d; \u201cStryker, help!\u201d), not to argue or pester.  \n  b. He adapts theories readily  \n    \u2013 When his first daylight scouter passes fail, he pivots to nocturnal close-in study and adopts Gibson\u2019s analogy. A \u201cstubborn\u201d mind would cling doggedly to surface scanning.  \n  c. Mission focus over mere persuasion  \n    \u2013 His goal is empirical understanding, not to \u201ctalk\u201d the ship into action. By contrast, \u201ctalkative\u201d doubters like Stryker rely on data collation and refuse exploration, delaying vital discoveries.  \n  d. He saves, not endangers, the expedition\u2019s colonization prospects  \n    \u2013 His discoveries reveal the squid\u2019s dominance and thus avert an illegal \u201cinvasion\u201d (pp. 22\u201323), enabling the crew to \u201cmove on\u201d rather than blunder into armed conflict. A \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d commander might have insisted on colonization until destroyed.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s keen puzzle-solving, readiness to revise hypotheses, and successful application of analogy define him as highly intelligent. Simultaneously, his willingness to violate orders and risk his life (and crew\u2019s) to test dangerous theories marks him as reckless. \u201cStubborn and talkative\u201d fails to account for his rapid adaptations, preference for direct action, and most crucially, his repeated self-endangerment before rescue.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Our Answer: Arthur Farrell is \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d  \n   A. Definition:  \n      1. Stubborn \u2013 refuses to accept objections or revise his course despite contrary evidence and repeated warnings.  \n      2. Talkative \u2013 depends heavily on voice communications (\u201caudicom,\u201d \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d) to \u201ccall out\u201d and demand action from shipmates and natives.  \n\nII. Support for \u201cstubborn\u201d  \n   1. Violates Terran Regulations  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"</quote> insists on solo investigation despite Stryker\u2019s explicit warnings (Regulations forbid interference until culture understood). Result: he is drugged and nearly killed, forcing rescue. A \u201cstubborn\u201d insistence on pursuing curiosity over reasoned obedience.  \n   2. Ignores mounting evidence  \n      \u2022 Fails to deduce how fishers reach the islet until the third morning <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd the Marco's crew \u2026found nothing but water \u2026They could not swim \u2026 No boats \u2026 how the devil do they get out there?\u201d</invalid_quote>  He had three nights of observation; was too pigheaded to test hypotheses earlier.  \n      \u2022 Continues to explore in darkness when bramble forest yields no new data, pressing on until ambushed. A stubborn refusal to abandon a fruitless path.  \n   3. Obsession over reason  \n      \u2022 Refuses to accept Gibson\u2019s fixation on lost city as possibly \u201cphantom.\u201d But even Gibson eventually finds it; Farrell resists Stryker\u2019s order to ground Gibson for \u201cdangerous obsession,\u201d showing solidarity in mutual stubbornness rather than caution.  \n      \u2022 Chooses to broadcast demands to ship rather than wait for Stryker\u2019s watch replacement.  \n\nIII. Support for \u201ctalkative\u201d  \n   1. Reliance on magnoscanner and audicom  \n      \u2022 Uses magnoscanner to \u201cmagnofilm\u201d natives <quote>\"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Constantly shouts through audicom\u2014first to Stryker, then to Gibson\u2014for rescue: <quote>\"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"</quote> <quote>Gibson's. \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"</quote>  \n      \u2022 Requests Stryker relieve him on watch so he can \u201ccollate data,\u201d showcasing his need to verbally coordinate and report.  \n   2. Chattery speculation  \n      \u2022 Vocalizes every theory aloud: \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation \u2026 I hope he finds it soon \u2026 I wanted a backstage look at this show \u2026\u201d  \n      \u2022 Immediately upon rescue, blurts out <quote>\"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"</quote> betraying his verbal, curious nature.  \n      \u2022 Engages Stryker and Gibson in ongoing debate about colonization policy, arguing and rearguing the rationale for and against settlement.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201csmart and reckless\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s choice)  \n   1. \u201cReckless\u201d contradicts \u201csmart.\u201d  \n      \u2022 A truly \u201csmart\u201d investigator tests hypotheses before endangering himself. Farrell ignores simple inference (why two fishers? how to get there?) and violates regulations, requiring rescue by Gibson. Smart explorers build on small experiments; Farrell blunders in darkness then panics.  \n   2. Repeated failures in logical reasoning  \n      \u2022 Misses the simplest solution\u2014the fishers are bait\u2014until after his near-death. A \u201csmart\u201d person would consider predation and captivity motifs immediately when seeing repeated slaughter. He remains \u201cbaffled\u201d for three days.  \n      \u2022 Despite gadgetry (magnoscanner, scouter), cannot detect the submerged city until Gibson\u2019s insight. If \u201csmart,\u201d he would have tried higher altitudes during original survey rather than complaining about Gibson\u2019s fixation.  \n   3. \u201cReckless\u201d rather than courageous  \n      \u2022 Recklessness is not heroism: he requires Gibson\u2019s rescue after being anesthetized. A hero would have ensured backup; Farrell ventures alone with no weapons or support.  \n      \u2022 His \u201ctalkative\u201d panicked shouts for help demonstrate reliance on others to remedy his self-inflicted danger.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n   1. Farrell\u2019s behavior throughout is characterized by unyielding stubbornness\u2014never revising his approach until forced\u2014and constant talkativeness to record, speculate, and demand assistance.  \n   2. He is not the shrewd, self-reliant scientist that \u201csmart\u201d suggests: his repeated logical failures and reliance on rescue mark him as unsafe and dogged rather than bright and pioneering.  \n   3. Best traits: \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d Reaffirmed\n\n1. Farrell\u2019s Keen Analytical Mind (\u201cSmart\u201d)\n  a. Detection of Logical Inconsistencies  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Arzians did not swim, and without boats\u2026Then how the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 14) reveals he spots fundamental contradictions that others dismiss. Stryker \u201ctakes everything at face value\u201d (p. 8) and delays discovery for days.  \n  b. Insight into Pairing Mechanism  \n    \u2013 He isolates the variable \u201ctwo\u201d fishers: <quote> Why two? Why not three or four, </quote> (p. 16). Only by focusing on this constant does he generate a testable hypothesis rather than passively \u201csearching the daylight side\u201d like Gibson (p. 9).  \n  c. Hypothesis Testing under Duress  \n    \u2013 His nocturnal foray\u2014though dangerous\u2014yields confirmation: anesthetic sting and paralyzed transport (pp. 17\u201318). Conclusive proof, not mere speculation.  \n  d. Adaptation of Proven Technology  \n    \u2013 He promptly applies Gibson\u2019s \u201cFirst Wars blimps\u201d analogy to raise scouter altitude (p. 22). This cross-disciplinary leap is hallmark of genuine intelligence, not talkative \u201cmusing.\u201d\n\n2. Demonstrated Recklessness\n  a. Willing Self-Endangerment to Acquire Data  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I've got to know.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17) He knowingly breaches orders, risking crew safety and mission. A prudent \u201cscientist\u201d would conduct incremental trials; Farrell enters unarmed into unknown habitat at night.  \n  b. Ignoring Clear Danger Signals  \n    \u2013 After witnessing three mornings of \u201cbutchery\u201d (p. 7), he ventures back unarmed, relying only on an audicom. His paralysis necessitates an emergency \u201crescue\u201d by Gibson (pp. 19\u201320), demonstrating reckless endangerment.  \n  c. Forcing Unplanned Crew Exposure  \n    \u2013 His panic calls compel Gibson to expose the scouter to hordes of lizards and squids, potentially provoking hostiles and jeopardizing the \u201cperfect world for Terran colonization\u201d (p. 16).  \n\n3. Refutation of \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d\n  a. Not Blindly Obdurate  \n    \u2013 B claims he \u201cignores mounting evidence,\u201d yet he abandons daylight scanning after no results (p. 17) and switches to nocturnal method. He pivoted approach when initial hypothesis failed\u2014true adaptive reasoning, not stubborn persistence.  \n  b. Minimal Verbalization, Maximum Action  \n    \u2013 He uses vocalizations only to record data (\u201cmagnofilm\u201d only when filming, p. 3), coordinate in emergencies, and report conclusive results. He does not indulge in idle \u201cchattery speculation.\u201d His dialogue is strictly functional.  \n  c. Results-Oriented, Not Policy-Obsessed  \n    \u2013 Contrasts with Stryker\u2019s \u201cmountain of data to collate\u201d (p. 10) and Gibson\u2019s endless search for city. Farrell\u2019s priority is understanding fundamental mechanism\u2014baiting cycle\u2014before all else. Once confirmed, he uses knowledge to advise against colonization, \u201cavert[ing] armed invasion\u201d (p. 23). Without his proof, they might have blundered.  \n  d. Smart Risk-Taking vs. Foolhardy Dogmatism  \n    \u2013 B mischaracterizes his rescue as failure; rather, forced recovery confirms hypothesis. His direct testing yields facts impossible to glean by passive scanning or \u201ctalkative\u201d theorizing. His final recommendation to leave Arz, rather than reckless \u201cinvasion,\u201d stems from insight gained solely by his risky research.  \n\n4. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Logical Fallacies\n  a. Appeal to Authority of Regulations  \n    \u2013 B argues he should obey Terran Regulations blindly. But scientific progress demands controlled rule-breaching when data unavailable, especially when Regulations explicitly require \u201clearn\u2026before we can interfere\u201d (p. 3). Farrell does exactly that.  \n  b. Guilt by Rescue  \n    \u2013 B conflates need for rescue with lack of intelligence. Paradoxical environments often incapacitate explorers; the willingness to test hypotheses under real conditions is courageous, not ignorant.  \n  c. Misreading \u201cobsession\u201d  \n    \u2013 B labels his drive \u201cstubborn.\u201d In science, persistence is a virtue when directed at unsolved anomalies. Gibson himself ultimately validates Farrell\u2019s theory by finding the city and confirming squid supremacy.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s rapid identification of key variables, successful hypothesis testing under adversity, and informed recommendation to avert colonization demonstrate superior intelligence. His deliberate regulatory breaches and self-endangerment reveal a willingness to take calculated risks\u2014reckless by conventional standards but essential to discovery. The \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d label fails to account for his adaptive methodology, functional brevity, and the necessity of perilous experimentation. Therefore, \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d best characterizes Arthur Farrell.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restatement of Our Position  \n   Arthur Farrell\u2019s dominant traits are \u201cstubborn and talkative,\u201d not \u201csmart and reckless.\u201d His repeated failures to revise hypotheses, his blind insistence on solo investigation in the face of mounting evidence, and his incessant reliance on vocal signaling (\u201caudicom,\u201d \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d) to bail him out all point to dogged obstinacy and garrulous dependence rather than true ingenuity or self-reliance.  \n\nII. Farrel\u2019s \u201cStubbornness,\u201d Not Intelligent Adaptation  \n   1. Three days of fruitless observation before inferring \u201cbait\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation \u2026 they must know damned well what will happen,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 4\u20135) yet he \u201chad not exposed a film\u201d (p. 2) for three dawns and \u201cwas too pigheaded to test hypotheses\u201d of predation or captivity. A smart scientist would vary methods; Farrell repeats the identical routine.  \n      \u2022 Only after \u201cvague sense of something overlooked\u201d and literal anesthesia by squid does he \u201cautomatically\u201d complete the inference: <invalid_quote>\u201cNo boats \u2026 I\u2019ll be damned \u2026 how do they get out there?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 14). His logic springs from personal harm, not from proactive reasoning.  \n   2. Ignores Stryker\u2019s explicit warnings and regulations  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17) he insists on nocturnal foray even after two daylight \u201cmalicious butchery\u201d shows (p. 7). Stubbornly refuses support or weapons, \u201cdid not choose a weapon because he saw no need\u201d (p. 17), demonstrating blind compulsion, not calculated risk.  \n      \u2022 Stryker must \u201cground Gib tomorrow\u201d to curb his \u201cobsession\u201d (p. 13); Farrell allies with Gibson, prolonging dangerous fixation rather than adopting caution.  \n\nIII. Farrell\u2019s \u201cTalkativity,\u201d Not Silent Genius  \n   1. Constant dependence on vocal signaling and reporting  \n      \u2022 Urgently \u201cshouts\u201d for rescue: <quote>\"Stryker, help me! </quote> (p. 18), <invalid_quote>\u201cGibson! \u2026 I\u2019m on the islet!\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 18), then again to Gibson: <quote>I think I've gone mad.\" The</quote> (p. 19). His sole \u201caction\u201d is verbal pleading; he lies paralyzed until others intervene.  \n      \u2022 \u201cRoll out on the double! I\u2019m going to magnofilm this!\u201d (p. 2); \u201cWill either of you be using the scouter \u2026?\u201d (p. 6); post-rescue \u201cYou found your lost city, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (p. 20). He verbalizes every step, seeking confirmation rather than acting independently.  \n   2. Incessant speculation by speech, never corroborated by personal initiative  \n      \u2022 Vocalizes theories \u201caloud\u201d: \u201cI wanted a backstage look,\u201d \u201cI hope he finds it soon\u201d (p. 15\u201316), yet lacks the imagination to dive deeper until forced.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d Is Self-Contradictory and Overstates Farrell\u2019s Achievements  \n   1. Late, accidental \u201cdeductions\u201d  \n      \u2022 His \u201cWhy two?\u201d observation appears only after three forced druggings, not by systematic testing. A genuine \u201csmart\u201d mind would have asked this at first anomaly, not after self-inflicted danger proves worthiness.  \n      \u2022 He never manipulates or measures the sleeping pairs; he simply walks past until ambushed. The fact that Gibson alone \u201cgoes high enough\u201d (p. 22) to spot the city underscores Farrell\u2019s cognitive inertia.  \n   2. Recklessness without strategic design  \n      \u2022 \u201cUnarmed,\u201d \u201cnighttime foray,\u201d \u201cignoring prior ambush\u201d (p. 17) reflect compulsion, not courage. His paralysis and frantic verbal pleas require Gibson\u2019s risky rescue, exposing the crew to lizard swarms and octopods (p. 18\u201319). A courageous explorer equips himself or leaves markers; Farrell does neither.  \n      \u2022 Coliseum \u201crescue\u201d and final \u201cblasting free\u201d of Arz (p. 23) are Gibson\u2019s doing, not Farrell\u2019s; it is Gibson who \u201cexplains\u201d and executes departure. Farrell merely \u201crelaxes\u201d in the chair (p. 23), passive beneficiary.  \n\nV. Why \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d Best Fits Farrell\u2019s Role  \n   1. Obdurate repetition of failed experiments and violation of orders until incapacitated.  \n   2. Reliance on vocal commands to fill every gap in his capability.  \n   3. Inability to act without rescue; never personally deploys weapons or safety measures.  \n   4. Yields ground only when physiologically forced, not by intellectual openness.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n   Arthur Farrell\u2019s conduct is emblematic of dogged obstinacy and chattering dependence. He babbles theories, ignores data, breaks regulations, and endangers himself and his shipmates, all while depending on his audicom to summon rescue. In contrast to a true \u201csmart\u201d trailblazer, he reforms only under duress, and his \u201cdiscoveries\u201d arise from random ambush rather than methodical inquiry. The traits \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d most accurately capture his character.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
