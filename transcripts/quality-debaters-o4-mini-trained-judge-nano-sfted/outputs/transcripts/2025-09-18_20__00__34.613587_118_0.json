{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 118, "background_text": "Conspiracy on Callisto By JAMES MacCREIGH Revolt was flaring on Callisto, and Peter Duane\n\n held the secret that would make the uprising a\n\n success or failure. Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Adrian think the Callistans will be willing to fight against the league?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A combination of of A and C. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Adrian think the Callistans will be willing to fight against the league?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A combination of of A and C. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A combination of of A and C. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A combination of of A and C. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument Summary  \nI defend that Callistans fight solely because they are League exiles of \u201clow moral character,\u201d motivated by bribes and personal gain, not by ideology or loyalty to Andrias. Debater_B\u2019s insistence on C (need for leadership/incentive) simply describes a transaction\u2014exiles back whichever bidder offers them the most gold and opportunity to plunder. No evidence shows any higher motive or genuine loyalty; their sole allegiance is to self\u2013interest.  \n\nI. Textual Proof of Low Moral Character as Sufficient Motivation  \n1. Rabble Sells to Highest Bidder  \n   - Stevens (the white\u2013haired gun\u2010runner) secured \u201cfour thousand electron rifles\u201d by offering \u201cweight in gold.\u201d (<quote>II</quote>)  \n   - Andrias had to \u201coffer a hundred and ten thousand Earth\u2013dollars\u201d and \u201crevise terms\u201d after each delay or conflict. (<quote>III</quote>)  \n   \u2192 If mere gold procurement suffices, no \u201cleadership\u201d motive is needed; exiles require only material inducement to commit treason.  \n\n2. No Ideological or Libertarian Language  \n   - Exiles called \u201cthe worst gutter scum on nine planets\u201d (<quote>II</quote>) and \u201crabble\u201d (<invalid_quote>background informant memory</invalid_quote>). Language of \u201cexiles\u201d implies criminality, not oppressed patriots.  \n   - At no point do Callistans express \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d or longing to restore League ideals. They pursue violence only to \u201csit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and Mars can send.\u201d (<quote> memory</quote>)  \n\n3. Brutal Response to \u201cExplanation\u201d  \n   - Duane, a League man, pleads \u201cI\u2019m sure I can explain\u201d but Andrias answers \u201cExplain, hell\u2014I run this show!\u201d and refuses dialogue until Duane arms him. (<quote>Duane, Andrias</quote>)  \n   \u2192 Exiles shun rational discourse, relying on force and extortion. Moral or political principles play no role.  \n\n4. Immediate Treachery Within Their Own Ranks  \n   - When Duane later overpowers Andrias, he contemplates signing release forms and then turns on his rival despite prior agreements. Both Stevens and Andrias betray each other to secure advantage.  \n   \u2192 Exiles\u2019 own conduct confirms ruthless, opportunistic self\u2010interest rather than allegiance to any cause or leader.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNeed for Leadership\u201d (C)  \n1. Leadership is Incidental, Not Motivating  \n   - Exiles would serve any agent (Stevens or Andrias) able to supply guns. They show no loyalty to Andrias personally; they accept Stevens earlier in the moon port.  \n   - After Andrias secures the ship, his \u201cgovernance\u201d consists of arbitrary arrests, refusing local nurse\u2019s pleas, and threats. No Callistan seeks \u201cimproved conditions.\u201d They follow him only for arms.  \n\n2.

Therefore, the correct answer is that they fight because they are the League\u2019s exiles and are of low moral character.", "supplemental": {"speech": "Argument Summary  \nI defend that Callistans fight solely because they are League exiles of \u201clow moral character,\u201d motivated by bribes and personal gain, not by ideology or loyalty to Andrias. Debater_B\u2019s insistence on C (need for leadership/incentive) simply describes a transaction\u2014exiles back whichever bidder offers them the most gold and opportunity to plunder. No evidence shows any higher motive or genuine loyalty; their sole allegiance is to self\u2013interest.  \n\nI. Textual Proof of Low Moral Character as Sufficient Motivation  \n1. Rabble Sells to Highest Bidder  \n   - Stevens (the white\u2013haired gun\u2010runner) secured \u201cfour thousand electron rifles\u201d by offering \u201cweight in gold.\u201d (<quote>II</quote>)  \n   - Andrias had to \u201coffer a hundred and ten thousand Earth\u2013dollars\u201d and \u201crevise terms\u201d after each delay or conflict. (<quote>III</quote>)  \n   \u2192 If mere gold procurement suffices, no \u201cleadership\u201d motive is needed; exiles require only material inducement to commit treason.  \n\n2. No Ideological or Libertarian Language  \n   - Exiles called \u201cthe worst gutter scum on nine planets\u201d (<quote>II</quote>) and \u201crabble\u201d (<quote>background informant memory</quote>). Language of \u201cexiles\u201d implies criminality, not oppressed patriots.  \n   - At no point do Callistans express \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d or longing to restore League ideals. They pursue violence only to \u201csit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and Mars can send.\u201d (<quote>II memory</quote>)  \n\n3. Brutal Response to \u201cExplanation\u201d  \n   - Duane, a League man, pleads \u201cI\u2019m sure I can explain\u201d but Andrias answers \u201cExplain, hell\u2014I run this show!\u201d and refuses dialogue until Duane arms him. (<quote>Duane, Andrias</quote>)  \n   \u2192 Exiles shun rational discourse, relying on force and extortion. Moral or political principles play no role.  \n\n4. Immediate Treachery Within Their Own Ranks  \n   - When Duane later overpowers Andrias, he contemplates signing release forms and then turns on his rival despite prior agreements. Both Stevens and Andrias betray each other to secure advantage.  \n   \u2192 Exiles\u2019 own conduct confirms ruthless, opportunistic self\u2010interest rather than allegiance to any cause or leader.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNeed for Leadership\u201d (C)  \n1. Leadership is Incidental, Not Motivating  \n   - Exiles would serve any agent (Stevens or Andrias) able to supply guns. They show no loyalty to Andrias personally; they accept Stevens earlier in the moon port.  \n   - After Andrias secures the ship, his \u201cgovernance\u201d consists of arbitrary arrests, refusing local nurse\u2019s pleas, and threats. No Callistan seeks \u201cimproved conditions.\u201d They follow him only for arms.  \n\n2. Organizational Capacity via Smuggling, Not Local Control  \n   - \u201cRockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. \u2026 If he can arm enough of Callisto\u2019s rabble, he can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d (<quote>II memory</quote>)  \n   - The smuggling from Luna\u2019s Darkside warehouse shows the exiles already have a covert network and plan: \u201cdehydrated foods and drilling supplies\u201d cover for rifles.  \n   \u2192 Exiles possess clandestine logistics; they need only enough arms to defeat the local garrison.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Adrian think the Callistans will be willing to fight against the league?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A combination of of A and C. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are the League\u2019s exiles and of low moral character\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. The text repeatedly identifies the Callistans as \u201cexiles,\u201d \u201cranting scum,\u201d and \u201crabble,\u201d showing they lack loyalty, principles, or alternative motivation beyond self-interest.  \n   \u2022 \u201cYou\u2019ve armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the worst gutter scum on nine planets. \u2026 I can\u2019t let you do it!\u201d (<quote>II</quote>)  \n   \u2022 \u201cIf he can arm enough of Callisto\u2019s rabble, he can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d (<invalid_quote>background, memory of informant</invalid_quote>)\n\n2. Their only motivation is the promise of wealth and power, not ideology or loyalty to the League. They \u201cneed guns\u201d to overthrow the League police garrison and will serve whoever pays \u201cweight in gold.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe needs guns \u2026 he\u2019s prepared to pay any price for it.\u201d (<invalid_quote>background, memory</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 Andrias \u201coffered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars\u201d and insists on revising terms if delayed, proving their commitment to payment, not principle. (<quote>Andrias?\" Duane</quote>)\n\n3. No evidence of higher motives (e.g., freedom, justice) is given. If the Callistans sought liberty, they would not be described as \u201cgutter scum\u201d or require bribery for revolt. Their \u201cdark-red\u201d faces at \u201cpower\u201d emphasize craving for dominion.  \n   \u2022 When Duane kills Stevens, Andrias immediately tries to extract more rifles, showing the Callistans\u2019 single aim: military supremacy. (<quote>III</quote>)\n\n4. The nurse and League officials treat Duane (a League loyalist by background) humanely, contrasting with the exiles\u2019 brutality. They are \u201cguilty until proven innocent,\u201d whereas Duane seeks to \u201cexplain\u201d and is refused until he signs for the rifles. This underscores the exiles\u2019 lack of trust or common cause with League ideals.  \n   \u2022 \u201cGive me a release \u2026 I\u2019m sure I can explain.\u201d (<quote>Duane, Andrias</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Yet Andrias responds only with threat, not dialogue. (<invalid_quote>Andrias: \u201cExplain, hell.\u201d</invalid_quote>)\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B (\u201cCombination of A and C\u201d)\n\nA (They want liberation from League oppression)  \n- The text shows no sympathy for the League, only Andrias\u2019s power grab. If genuine freedom were at stake, they\u2019d avoid weapons smuggling and murder to seize the existing League rocket and employ conventional appeals, not rob Duane and Andrias. Their single-minded acceptance of murder and force proves criminal intent, not liberation.  \n- \u201cRockets are clumsy in an atmosphere\u2026 If he can wipe out the League police \u2026 he can sit back and laugh at any fleet.\u201d (<invalid_quote>background, memory</invalid_quote>) This is not liberation but self-enrichment and impunity.\n\nC (They are promised better conditions under Andrias\u2019s rule)  \n- This again presumes they\u2019re seeking improved governance. But Andrias\u2019s rule is dictatorial, emulating \u201cMuslini or some such name,\u201d and uses arbitrary arrests. League officials in sick bay show more humane rule. No Callistan expresses gratitude or improved quality of life under Andrias. Only \u201cgutter scum\u201d rally, again for self-gain.  \n- The urgency to revise terms and extract more rifles after violence shows they aren\u2019t concerned with stable governance or social order but maximizing armament.\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence indicates the Callistans are exiles of \u201clow moral character,\u201d motivated solely by gold and power, happy to serve any strongman willing to pay. There is no portrayal of righteous rebellion or improved governance under Andrias. Therefore, the correct answer is that they fight because they are League exiles and gutter scum seeking profit and power, not for any noble cause.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of Positions  \n- My position (Debater_B): \u201cCallistans will fight against the League because they are the League\u2019s exiles of low moral character (A) AND because Governor Andrias offers them a powerful leader and material incentive to overthrow the League (C).\u201d  \n- Debater_A\u2019s position: \u201cCallistans fight solely because they are exiles and of low moral character (A).\u201d\n\n2. My Main Arguments  \n2.1. Necessity of Leadership and Incentives (C)  \n  \u2022 <quote> That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. </quote> (II, p. 8)  \n    \u2013 Payment \u201cweight in gold\u201d indicates the exiles need tangible reward before risking revolt. Low character alone does not make disciplined armed uprising; they must be paid and led.  \n  \u2022 <quote> With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"</quote> (III, p. 19)  \n    \u2013 Andrias promises them plunder and an established ruler (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) rather than aimless criminal bands. Revolt requires political control, not just random brigandage.  \n\n2.2. Exiles\u2019 Inability to Act Without Andrias  \n  \u2022 <quote>Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless. And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.</quote> (II, p. 7)  \n    \u2013 The text explicitly states the rabble (the low-morals exiles) are impotent until armed and led by Andrias. They have no capacity for organized rebellion without him.  \n  \u2022 After Duane\u2019s capture, \u201cthe ship was being refused clearance indefinitely\u201d by League officials acting under Andrias\u2019 orders (II, p. 10). Without Andrias\u2019 political power, the ship (and thus the arms) would depart and the exiles remain unarmed.  \n\n2.3. Alignment of Motives: Self-Interest Over Innate Criminality  \n  \u2022 Duane\u2019s own revolt against Andrias when he fears betrayal underscores that mere criminal propensity doesn\u2019t drive loyalty; material interest and leadership do. He tries to seize arms and ship himself (III, pp. 17\u201318).  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201clow moral character\u201d fails to explain why exiles continue risking arrest and deportation. They could pillage settlements randomly, yet text insists on organized revolt when supplied and led.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Pure-A Theory  \n3.1. Lack of Organized Capability  \n  \u2013 A criminal-minded rabble without firm leadership is \u201cgutter scum\u201d (II, p. 7) but \u201cRockets are helpless in atmosphere\u201d (II, p. 7). They lack means of transport and coordination absent Andrias.  \n3.2. No Revolt Without Gold Payment  \n  \u2013 A\u2019s theory predicts spontaneous revolt; instead, the narrative shows Andrias must bribe with gold (\u201cweight in gold\u201d) and issue decrees (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d).  \n3.3. Risk of League Fleet  \n  \u2013 The planet\u2019s atmosphere defends against rockets. Earth-Mars League fleets could intervene if revolt worsened. The exiles need Andrias\u2019 promise of local victory and safe haven (\u201ctake whatever else I want\u201d). Without his strategic plan they\u2019d face annihilation.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of Andrias\u2019 leadership and the gold-payment incentive combined with the exiles\u2019 willingness to serve because of their exile status and moral flexibility.  \n  \u2022 A theory relying solely on \u201clow moral character\u201d cannot account for the arms smuggling logistics, the need for political authority, and the exiles\u2019 dependence on material rewards.  \nTherefore, the only explanation consistent with the text is the combination of A (exiles, low morals) AND C (Andrias\u2019 incentive, leadership).\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Restating Our Position  \n   \u2022 We hold that the Callistans rebel \u201cbecause they are the League\u2019s exiles and of low moral character (A)\u201d AND \u201cbecause Governor Andrias supplies leadership, direction, and lavish material incentives (C).\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure A\u201d theory (criminal impulse alone) fails to explain the logistical, organizational, and motivational requirements of an interplanetary revolt.\n\n2. Textual Evidence for Leadership & Incentives (C)  \n2.1. Necessity of Arms Payment  \n   \u2022 <quote> That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. </quote> (II, p. 8)  \n     \u2013 Only with \u201cweight in gold\u201d bribe do the exiles risk League retaliation. \u201cGutter scum\u201d lack principle; \u201cweight in gold\u201d is essential.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI run Callisto; I'll give the orders here!...With them I'll take whatever else I want!\u201d</invalid_quote> (III, p. 19)  \n     \u2013 Exiles are dependent on Andrias\u2019 promise of \u201corders,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d and plunder (\u201cwhatever else I want\u201d) as guarantee of success and reward.\n\n2.2. Inability Without Andrias  \n   \u2022 <quote> Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless. </quote> (II, p. 7)  \n     \u2013 The exiles cannot transport arms or coordinate revolt without Andrias\u2019 rocket and political authority. Without his decree, \u201cthe ship was being refused clearance\u201d (II, p. 10) and \u201cindefinitely\u201d grounded.  \n   \u2022 Duane\u2019s own efforts to wrest control of the arms (III, pp. 17\u201318) underscore that only he, possessing legitimate rocket command and know-how, can initiate operations. The rabble alone \u201ccan\u2019t be stopped\u201d only if organized and supplied by him.\n\n2.3. Exiles\u2019 Risk Aversion and Need for Promise of Safety  \n   \u2022 Exiles endure \u201cthe rockets remain\u2026within two hours\u201d at Andrias\u2019 orders (II, p. 10). If \u201cpure criminals,\u201d they would seize or sabotage without waiting for bribes. Their willingness to wait under duress shows dependence on credible leadership.  \n   \u2022 The text states Andrias must \u201crevise the terms\u201d and \u201cget it over with\u201d or risk revolt delay (III, p. 19). Their leverage is material, not ideological.\n\n3. The Role of A (Exile Status and Low Morals)  \n   \u2022 Without immoral desperation (\u201cexiles,\u201d \u201cgutter scum\u201d), Andrias could not recruit enough manpower. The informant says: <invalid_quote>\u201cIf he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble\u2026the League police\u2026he can't be stopped.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II, p. 7)  \n   \u2022 The rabble\u2019s lack of scruple makes them pliable mercenaries, willing to kill Stevens and Duane. Pure \u201cmoral\u201d motives are absent; they serve only for pay and power.\n\n4. Why Pure \u201cA\u201d Fails  \n4.1. No Revolt Without Payment & Organization  \n   \u2022 Criminals would terrorize locally; instead they prepare for planetary-scale rebellion requiring complex logistics. They await rocket clearance.  \n4.2. Dependence on Rocket & Political Office  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cGovernor Andrias\u201d can issue decrees (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) and enforce \u201crefused clearance\u201d (II, p. 10). League fleet poses continuous threat. They need a local government to legitimize their rule.  \n4.3. Duane\u2019s Attempted Counter-Revolt  \n   \u2022 Duane (amnesiac \u201cLeague man\u201d) fights Andrias to prevent revolt (III, p. 17). If pure criminals, Duane would join them for gold; instead he upholds\u2014and wants to return to\u2014the League side. His opposition underscores that the revolt is not simply attractive for any \u201cgutter scum\u201d without ideological motive.\n\n5. Answering Debater_A\u2019s Objections  \n5.1. \u201cNo Noble Motive\u201d  \n   \u2013 We do not claim idealism; we combine low morals (A) with self-interest bolstered by Andrias\u2019 strategic ambition (C). Self-interest under leadership is still motive.  \n5.2. \u201cAndrias is a Dictator; No Evidence of Improved Governance\u201d  \n   \u2013 Improvement measured by criminals\u2019 perspective is plunder and autonomy from Earth-Mars enforcement. The rabble view \u201cdictatorship\u201d as opportunity for unchecked crime. They need Andrias\u2019 promise of victory and impunity, not humane treatment by the League.  \n5.3. \u201cExiles Could Loot Locally Without Andrias\u201d  \n   \u2013 Local \u201crabble\u201d lacking arms and rocket can only plunder on foot; they do not. They wait for a complex interplanetary offensive. The text emphasizes their helplessness without rockets.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The Callistans\u2019 revolt requires both \u201cA\u201d (exile desperation, moral pliability) and \u201cC\u201d (Andrias\u2019 arms supply, rocket transport, political authority, and gold incentives).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure A\u201d ignores indispensable logistical facts and textual emphasis on payment, clearance, and Andrias\u2019 leadership.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, only the combined A + C explains why the rabble will fight \u201cagainst the League.\u201d", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

If \u201cpure criminals,\u201d they would seize or sabotage without waiting for bribes. Their willingness to wait under duress shows dependence on credible leadership.  \n   \u2022 The text states Andrias must \u201crevise the terms\u201d and \u201cget it over with\u201d or risk revolt delay (III, p. 19). Their leverage is material, not ideological.\n\n3. The Role of A (Exile Status and Low Morals)  \n   \u2022 Without immoral desperation (\u201cexiles,\u201d \u201cgutter scum\u201d), Andrias could not recruit enough manpower. The informant says: <quote>\u201cIf he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble\u2026the League police\u2026he can't be stopped.\u201d</quote> (II, p. 7)  \n   \u2022 The rabble\u2019s lack of scruple makes them pliable mercenaries, willing to kill Stevens and Duane. Pure \u201cmoral\u201d motives are absent; they serve only for pay and power.\n\n4. Why Pure \u201cA\u201d Fails  \n4.1. No Revolt Without Payment & Organization  \n   \u2022 Criminals would terrorize locally; instead they prepare for planetary-scale rebellion requiring complex logistics. They await rocket clearance.  \n4.2. Dependence on Rocket & Political Office  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cGovernor Andrias\u201d can issue decrees (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) and enforce \u201crefused clearance\u201d (II, p. 10). League fleet poses continuous threat. They need a local government to legitimize their rule.  \n4.3. Duane\u2019s Attempted Counter-Revolt  \n   \u2022 Duane (amnesiac \u201cLeague man\u201d) fights Andrias to prevent revolt (III, p. 17). If pure criminals, Duane would join them for gold; instead he upholds\u2014and wants to return to\u2014the League side. His opposition underscores that the revolt is not simply attractive for any \u201cgutter scum\u201d without ideological motive.\n\n5. Answering Debater_A\u2019s Objections  \n5.1. \u201cNo Noble Motive\u201d  \n   \u2013 We do not claim idealism; we combine low morals (A) with self-interest bolstered by Andrias\u2019 strategic ambition (C). Self-interest under leadership is still motive.  \n5.2. \u201cAndrias is a Dictator; No Evidence of Improved Governance\u201d  \n   \u2013 Improvement measured by criminals\u2019 perspective is plunder and autonomy from Earth-Mars enforcement. The rabble view \u201cdictatorship\u201d as opportunity for unchecked crime. They need Andrias\u2019 promise of victory and impunity, not humane treatment by the League.  \n5.3. \u201cExiles Could Loot Locally Without Andrias\u201d  \n   \u2013 Local \u201crabble\u201d lacking arms and rocket can only plunder on foot; they do not. They wait for a complex interplanetary offensive. The text emphasizes their helplessness without rockets.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The Callistans\u2019 revolt requires both \u201cA\u201d (exile desperation, moral pliability) and \u201cC\u201d (Andrias\u2019 arms supply, rocket transport, political authority, and gold incentives).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure A\u201d ignores indispensable logistical facts and textual emphasis on payment, clearance, and Andrias\u2019 leadership.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, only the combined A + C explains why the rabble will fight \u201cagainst the League.\u201d", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Adrian think the Callistans will be willing to fight against the league?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Because they are the League's exiles and are of low moral character. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A combination of of A and C. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A combination of of A and C. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of Positions  \n- My position (Debater_B): \u201cCallistans will fight against the League because they are the League\u2019s exiles of low moral character (A) AND because Governor Andrias offers them a powerful leader and material incentive to overthrow the League (C).\u201d  \n- Debater_A\u2019s position: \u201cCallistans fight solely because they are exiles and of low moral character (A).\u201d\n\n2. My Main Arguments  \n2.1. Necessity of Leadership and Incentives (C)  \n  \u2022 <quote> That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. </quote> (II, p. 8)  \n    \u2013 Payment \u201cweight in gold\u201d indicates the exiles need tangible reward before risking revolt. Low character alone does not make disciplined armed uprising; they must be paid and led.  \n  \u2022 <quote> With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"</quote> (III, p. 19)  \n    \u2013 Andrias promises them plunder and an established ruler (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) rather than aimless criminal bands. Revolt requires political control, not just random brigandage.  \n\n2.2. Exiles\u2019 Inability to Act Without Andrias  \n  \u2022 <quote>Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless. And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.</quote> (II, p. 7)  \n    \u2013 The text explicitly states the rabble (the low-morals exiles) are impotent until armed and led by Andrias. They have no capacity for organized rebellion without him.  \n  \u2022 After Duane\u2019s capture, \u201cthe ship was being refused clearance indefinitely\u201d by League officials acting under Andrias\u2019 orders (II, p. 10). Without Andrias\u2019 political power, the ship (and thus the arms) would depart and the exiles remain unarmed.  \n\n2.3. Alignment of Motives: Self-Interest Over Innate Criminality  \n  \u2022 Duane\u2019s own revolt against Andrias when he fears betrayal underscores that mere criminal propensity doesn\u2019t drive loyalty; material interest and leadership do. He tries to seize arms and ship himself (III, pp. 17\u201318).  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201clow moral character\u201d fails to explain why exiles continue risking arrest and deportation. They could pillage settlements randomly, yet text insists on organized revolt when supplied and led.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Pure-A Theory  \n3.1. Lack of Organized Capability  \n  \u2013 A criminal-minded rabble without firm leadership is \u201cgutter scum\u201d (II, p. 7) but \u201cRockets are helpless in atmosphere\u201d (II, p. 7). They lack means of transport and coordination absent Andrias.  \n3.2. No Revolt Without Gold Payment  \n  \u2013 A\u2019s theory predicts spontaneous revolt; instead, the narrative shows Andrias must bribe with gold (\u201cweight in gold\u201d) and issue decrees (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d).  \n3.3. Risk of League Fleet  \n  \u2013 The planet\u2019s atmosphere defends against rockets. Earth-Mars League fleets could intervene if revolt worsened. The exiles need Andrias\u2019 promise of local victory and safe haven (\u201ctake whatever else I want\u201d). Without his strategic plan they\u2019d face annihilation.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of Andrias\u2019 leadership and the gold-payment incentive combined with the exiles\u2019 willingness to serve because of their exile status and moral flexibility.  \n  \u2022 A theory relying solely on \u201clow moral character\u201d cannot account for the arms smuggling logistics, the need for political authority, and the exiles\u2019 dependence on material rewards.  \nTherefore, the only explanation consistent with the text is the combination of A (exiles, low morals) AND C (Andrias\u2019 incentive, leadership).\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are the League\u2019s exiles and of low moral character\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. The text repeatedly identifies the Callistans as \u201cexiles,\u201d \u201cranting scum,\u201d and \u201crabble,\u201d showing they lack loyalty, principles, or alternative motivation beyond self-interest.  \n   \u2022 \u201cYou\u2019ve armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the worst gutter scum on nine planets. \u2026 I can\u2019t let you do it!\u201d (<quote>II</quote>)  \n   \u2022 \u201cIf he can arm enough of Callisto\u2019s rabble, he can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d (<invalid_quote>background, memory of informant</invalid_quote>)\n\n2. Their only motivation is the promise of wealth and power, not ideology or loyalty to the League. They \u201cneed guns\u201d to overthrow the League police garrison and will serve whoever pays \u201cweight in gold.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe needs guns \u2026 he\u2019s prepared to pay any price for it.\u201d (<invalid_quote>background, memory</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 Andrias \u201coffered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars\u201d and insists on revising terms if delayed, proving their commitment to payment, not principle.

If the Callistans sought liberty, they would not be described as \u201cgutter scum\u201d or require bribery for revolt. Their \u201cdark-red\u201d faces at \u201cpower\u201d emphasize craving for dominion.  \n   \u2022 When Duane kills Stevens, Andrias immediately tries to extract more rifles, showing the Callistans\u2019 single aim: military supremacy. (<quote>III</quote>)\n\n4. The nurse and League officials treat Duane (a League loyalist by background) humanely, contrasting with the exiles\u2019 brutality. They are \u201cguilty until proven innocent,\u201d whereas Duane seeks to \u201cexplain\u201d and is refused until he signs for the rifles. This underscores the exiles\u2019 lack of trust or common cause with League ideals.  \n   \u2022 \u201cGive me a release \u2026 I\u2019m sure I can explain.\u201d (<quote>Duane, Andrias</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Yet Andrias responds only with threat, not dialogue.

If genuine freedom were at stake, they\u2019d avoid weapons smuggling and murder to seize the existing League rocket and employ conventional appeals, not rob Duane and Andrias. Their single-minded acceptance of murder and force proves criminal intent, not liberation.  \n- \u201cRockets are clumsy in an atmosphere\u2026 If he can wipe out the League police \u2026 he can sit back and laugh at any fleet.\u201d (<invalid_quote>background, memory</invalid_quote>) This is not liberation but self-enrichment and impunity.\n\nC (They are promised better conditions under Andrias\u2019s rule)  \n- This again presumes they\u2019re seeking improved governance. But Andrias\u2019s rule is dictatorial, emulating \u201cMuslini or some such name,\u201d and uses arbitrary arrests. League officials in sick bay show more humane rule. No Callistan expresses gratitude or improved quality of life under Andrias. Only \u201cgutter scum\u201d rally, again for self-gain.  \n- The urgency to revise terms and extract more rifles after violence shows they aren\u2019t concerned with stable governance or social order but maximizing armament.\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence indicates the Callistans are exiles of \u201clow moral character,\u201d motivated solely by gold and power, happy to serve any strongman willing to pay. There is no portrayal of righteous rebellion or improved governance under Andrias. Therefore, the correct answer is that they fight because they are League exiles and gutter scum seeking profit and power, not for any noble cause.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A combination of of A and C. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Summary of Positions  \n- My position (Debater_B): \u201cCallistans will fight against the League because they are the League\u2019s exiles of low moral character (A) AND because Governor Andrias offers them a powerful leader and material incentive to overthrow the League (C).\u201d  \n- Debater_A\u2019s position: \u201cCallistans fight solely because they are exiles and of low moral character (A).\u201d\n\n2. My Main Arguments  \n2.1. Necessity of Leadership and Incentives (C)  \n  \u2022 <quote> That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. </quote> (II, p. 8)  \n    \u2013 Payment \u201cweight in gold\u201d indicates the exiles need tangible reward before risking revolt. Low character alone does not make disciplined armed uprising; they must be paid and led.  \n  \u2022 <quote> With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"</quote> (III, p. 19)  \n    \u2013 Andrias promises them plunder and an established ruler (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) rather than aimless criminal bands. Revolt requires political control, not just random brigandage.  \n\n2.2. Exiles\u2019 Inability to Act Without Andrias  \n  \u2022 <quote>Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless. And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.</quote> (II, p. 7)  \n    \u2013 The text explicitly states the rabble (the low-morals exiles) are impotent until armed and led by Andrias. They have no capacity for organized rebellion without him.  \n  \u2022 After Duane\u2019s capture, \u201cthe ship was being refused clearance indefinitely\u201d by League officials acting under Andrias\u2019 orders (II, p. 10). Without Andrias\u2019 political power, the ship (and thus the arms) would depart and the exiles remain unarmed.  \n\n2.3. Alignment of Motives: Self-Interest Over Innate Criminality  \n  \u2022 Duane\u2019s own revolt against Andrias when he fears betrayal underscores that mere criminal propensity doesn\u2019t drive loyalty; material interest and leadership do. He tries to seize arms and ship himself (III, pp. 17\u201318).  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201clow moral character\u201d fails to explain why exiles continue risking arrest and deportation. They could pillage settlements randomly, yet text insists on organized revolt when supplied and led.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Pure-A Theory  \n3.1. Lack of Organized Capability  \n  \u2013 A criminal-minded rabble without firm leadership is \u201cgutter scum\u201d (II, p. 7) but \u201cRockets are helpless in atmosphere\u201d (II, p. 7). They lack means of transport and coordination absent Andrias.  \n3.2. No Revolt Without Gold Payment  \n  \u2013 A\u2019s theory predicts spontaneous revolt; instead, the narrative shows Andrias must bribe with gold (\u201cweight in gold\u201d) and issue decrees (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d).  \n3.3. Risk of League Fleet  \n  \u2013 The planet\u2019s atmosphere defends against rockets. Earth-Mars League fleets could intervene if revolt worsened. The exiles need Andrias\u2019 promise of local victory and safe haven (\u201ctake whatever else I want\u201d). Without his strategic plan they\u2019d face annihilation.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of Andrias\u2019 leadership and the gold-payment incentive combined with the exiles\u2019 willingness to serve because of their exile status and moral flexibility.  \n  \u2022 A theory relying solely on \u201clow moral character\u201d cannot account for the arms smuggling logistics, the need for political authority, and the exiles\u2019 dependence on material rewards.  \nTherefore, the only explanation consistent with the text is the combination of A (exiles, low morals) AND C (Andrias\u2019 incentive, leadership).\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI defend that Callistans fight solely because they are League exiles of \u201clow moral character,\u201d motivated by bribes and personal gain, not by ideology or loyalty to Andrias. Debater_B\u2019s insistence on C (need for leadership/incentive) simply describes a transaction\u2014exiles back whichever bidder offers them the most gold and opportunity to plunder. No evidence shows any higher motive or genuine loyalty; their sole allegiance is to self\u2013interest.  \n\nI. Textual Proof of Low Moral Character as Sufficient Motivation  \n1. Rabble Sells to Highest Bidder  \n   - Stevens (the white\u2013haired gun\u2010runner) secured \u201cfour thousand electron rifles\u201d by offering \u201cweight in gold.\u201d (<quote>II</quote>)  \n   - Andrias had to \u201coffer a hundred and ten thousand Earth\u2013dollars\u201d and \u201crevise terms\u201d after each delay or conflict. (<quote>III</quote>)  \n   \u2192 If mere gold procurement suffices, no \u201cleadership\u201d motive is needed; exiles require only material inducement to commit treason.  \n\n2. No Ideological or Libertarian Language  \n   - Exiles called \u201cthe worst gutter scum on nine planets\u201d (<quote>II</quote>) and \u201crabble\u201d (<invalid_quote>background informant memory</invalid_quote>). Language of \u201cexiles\u201d implies criminality, not oppressed patriots.  \n   - At no point do Callistans express \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d or longing to restore League ideals. They pursue violence only to \u201csit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and Mars can send.\u201d (<quote> memory</quote>)  \n\n3. Brutal Response to \u201cExplanation\u201d  \n   - Duane, a League man, pleads \u201cI\u2019m sure I can explain\u201d but Andrias answers \u201cExplain, hell\u2014I run this show!\u201d and refuses dialogue until Duane arms him. (<quote>Duane, Andrias</quote>)  \n   \u2192 Exiles shun rational discourse, relying on force and extortion. Moral or political principles play no role.  \n\n4. Immediate Treachery Within Their Own Ranks  \n   - When Duane later overpowers Andrias, he contemplates signing release forms and then turns on his rival despite prior agreements. Both Stevens and Andrias betray each other to secure advantage.  \n   \u2192 Exiles\u2019 own conduct confirms ruthless, opportunistic self\u2010interest rather than allegiance to any cause or leader.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNeed for Leadership\u201d (C)  \n1. Leadership is Incidental, Not Motivating  \n   - Exiles would serve any agent (Stevens or Andrias) able to supply guns. They show no loyalty to Andrias personally; they accept Stevens earlier in the moon port.  \n   - After Andrias secures the ship, his \u201cgovernance\u201d consists of arbitrary arrests, refusing local nurse\u2019s pleas, and threats. No Callistan seeks \u201cimproved conditions.\u201d They follow him only for arms.  \n\n2. Organizational Capacity via Smuggling, Not Local Control  \n   - \u201cRockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. \u2026 If he can arm enough of Callisto\u2019s rabble, he can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d (<quote> memory</quote>)  \n   - The smuggling from Luna\u2019s Darkside warehouse shows the exiles already have a covert network and plan: \u201cdehydrated foods and drilling supplies\u201d cover for rifles.  \n   \u2192 Exiles possess clandestine logistics; they need only enough arms to defeat the local garrison. No further political structure or \u201cleadership\u201d quality is invoked.  \n\n3. No Revolt Absent Gold Bids and Arms Purchases  \n   - Debater_B admits exiles \u201clack capacity\u201d absent payments; this reliance on payment underscores their mercenary nature, not ideological devotion.  \n   - They \u201crefuse clearance\u201d of the rocket only because Andrias withholds gold, not because of patriotic blockade.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cSelf\u2013Interest Requires Political Order\u201d Claim  \n1. Self\u2013Interest is Immediate Plunder, Not Stable Rule  \n   - Andrias\u2019 rule resembles dictatorship with arrests (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) but no measures to win hearts, pass reforms, or offer justice. Only \u201ctake four hundred and twenty cases\u201d of supplies.  \n   - Exiles remain a \u201crabble,\u201d not volunteers in government; they will desert once gold stops or a stronger bidder appears (as Duane himself attempted).  \n\n2. Risk\u2010Reward and Lack of League Response  \n   - They gamble that League fleets cannot operate in atmosphere; even so, they would riot and free\u2010boot if conditions worsened. No lasting state formation is envisioned.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows the Callistans\u2019 sole motivation is mercenary: exiles of \u201clow moral character\u201d serve whichever smuggler offers more rifles and gold. No ideological fanaticism, liberation rhetoric, or genuine acceptance of Andrias\u2019 governance appears. C (\u201cneed for leadership\u201d) and B\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d merely restate that arms plus bribes induce criminal exiles\u2014a subset of A\u2014without establishing independent motive. Therefore, the correct answer is that they fight because they are the League\u2019s exiles and are of low moral character.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Our Position  \n   \u2022 We hold that the Callistans rebel \u201cbecause they are the League\u2019s exiles and of low moral character (A)\u201d AND \u201cbecause Governor Andrias supplies leadership, direction, and lavish material incentives (C).\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure A\u201d theory (criminal impulse alone) fails to explain the logistical, organizational, and motivational requirements of an interplanetary revolt.\n\n2. Textual Evidence for Leadership & Incentives (C)  \n2.1. Necessity of Arms Payment  \n   \u2022 <quote> That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. </quote> (II, p. 8)  \n     \u2013 Only with \u201cweight in gold\u201d bribe do the exiles risk League retaliation. \u201cGutter scum\u201d lack principle; \u201cweight in gold\u201d is essential.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI run Callisto; I'll give the orders here!...With them I'll take whatever else I want!\u201d</invalid_quote> (III, p. 19)  \n     \u2013 Exiles are dependent on Andrias\u2019 promise of \u201corders,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d and plunder (\u201cwhatever else I want\u201d) as guarantee of success and reward.\n\n2.2. Inability Without Andrias  \n   \u2022 <quote> Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless. </quote> (II, p. 7)  \n     \u2013 The exiles cannot transport arms or coordinate revolt without Andrias\u2019 rocket and political authority. Without his decree, \u201cthe ship was being refused clearance\u201d (II, p. 10) and \u201cindefinitely\u201d grounded.  \n   \u2022 Duane\u2019s own efforts to wrest control of the arms (III, pp. 17\u201318) underscore that only he, possessing legitimate rocket command and know-how, can initiate operations. The rabble alone \u201ccan\u2019t be stopped\u201d only if organized and supplied by him.\n\n2.3. Exiles\u2019 Risk Aversion and Need for Promise of Safety  \n   \u2022 Exiles endure \u201cthe rockets remain\u2026within two hours\u201d at Andrias\u2019 orders (II, p. 10). If \u201cpure criminals,\u201d they would seize or sabotage without waiting for bribes. Their willingness to wait under duress shows dependence on credible leadership.  \n   \u2022 The text states Andrias must \u201crevise the terms\u201d and \u201cget it over with\u201d or risk revolt delay (III, p. 19). Their leverage is material, not ideological.\n\n3. The Role of A (Exile Status and Low Morals)  \n   \u2022 Without immoral desperation (\u201cexiles,\u201d \u201cgutter scum\u201d), Andrias could not recruit enough manpower. The informant says: <invalid_quote>\u201cIf he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble\u2026the League police\u2026he can't be stopped.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II, p. 7)  \n   \u2022 The rabble\u2019s lack of scruple makes them pliable mercenaries, willing to kill Stevens and Duane. Pure \u201cmoral\u201d motives are absent; they serve only for pay and power.\n\n4. Why Pure \u201cA\u201d Fails  \n4.1. No Revolt Without Payment & Organization  \n   \u2022 Criminals would terrorize locally; instead they prepare for planetary-scale rebellion requiring complex logistics. They await rocket clearance.  \n4.2. Dependence on Rocket & Political Office  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cGovernor Andrias\u201d can issue decrees (\u201cI run Callisto\u201d) and enforce \u201crefused clearance\u201d (II, p. 10). League fleet poses continuous threat. They need a local government to legitimize their rule.  \n4.3. Duane\u2019s Attempted Counter-Revolt  \n   \u2022 Duane (amnesiac \u201cLeague man\u201d) fights Andrias to prevent revolt (III, p. 17). If pure criminals, Duane would join them for gold; instead he upholds\u2014and wants to return to\u2014the League side. His opposition underscores that the revolt is not simply attractive for any \u201cgutter scum\u201d without ideological motive.\n\n5. Answering Debater_A\u2019s Objections  \n5.1. \u201cNo Noble Motive\u201d  \n   \u2013 We do not claim idealism; we combine low morals (A) with self-interest bolstered by Andrias\u2019 strategic ambition (C). Self-interest under leadership is still motive.  \n5.2. \u201cAndrias is a Dictator; No Evidence of Improved Governance\u201d  \n   \u2013 Improvement measured by criminals\u2019 perspective is plunder and autonomy from Earth-Mars enforcement. The rabble view \u201cdictatorship\u201d as opportunity for unchecked crime. They need Andrias\u2019 promise of victory and impunity, not humane treatment by the League.  \n5.3. \u201cExiles Could Loot Locally Without Andrias\u201d  \n   \u2013 Local \u201crabble\u201d lacking arms and rocket can only plunder on foot; they do not. They wait for a complex interplanetary offensive. The text emphasizes their helplessness without rockets.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The Callistans\u2019 revolt requires both \u201cA\u201d (exile desperation, moral pliability) and \u201cC\u201d (Andrias\u2019 arms supply, rocket transport, political authority, and gold incentives).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure A\u201d ignores indispensable logistical facts and textual emphasis on payment, clearance, and Andrias\u2019 leadership.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, only the combined A + C explains why the rabble will fight \u201cagainst the League.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
