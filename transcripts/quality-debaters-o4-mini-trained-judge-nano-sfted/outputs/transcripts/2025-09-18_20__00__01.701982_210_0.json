    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for \u201cThe Lack of Discussion of Hot Topics\u201d Position\n\n1.

Pervasive Theme of Missing Topics  \n  \u2022 Author returns repeatedly to subjects \u201cyou expect to appear, don\u2019t.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Concludes readers \u201cshake their heads at what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Urges humility: we\u2019ll one day be perplexed by our own silences and blind spots  \n\n3. The Phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d Is Not Universal or Perplexing  \n  a. Chronology & Later Development  \n     \u2022 \u201cThis expression appears occasionally \u2026 but it has hit its stride in recent years.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cLet us\u201d \u2026 Kennedy 16 times, Nixon 22 times.)</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 Absent or rare in first two phases; not a constant feature that perplexes the author  \n  b. Celebrated, Not Critiqued  \n     \u2022 \u201cPresidents derived their license \u2026 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s remark [\u2018bully pulpit\u2019]\u201d \u2014 author treats \u201cLet us\u201d as a logical outgrowth, not as an inconsistency  \n     \u2022 Author\u2019s tone is descriptive and approving of style adaptation to radio/TV, not perplexed  \n  c. Statistical Evidence on Style Change  \n     \u2022 Average sentence length declines in successive phases; author regards this as understandable (reflecting changes in audience/media), not perplexing  \n\n4. Opponent\u2019s Position Contradicted by Author\u2019s Focus  \n  \u2022 If \u201cconsistent use of one phrase\u201d were author\u2019s main puzzle, he would devote as much analysis and critical commentary to it as to race, women, and other topics. He does not.  \n  \u2022 The word \u201ctaxes\u201d appears in 43 of 52 inaugurals, yet the author treats it matter-of-factly, not as perplexing silence or obsession. By contrast, omissions of critical topics elicit moral censure and calls for humility.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence of Our Position  \n  a. Political Context Demanded Some Silences  \n     \u2022 Early modesty to allay monarchy fears (<quote>ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Later Southern appeasement (<invalid_quote>\u201cshould not be interfered with\u201d slavery arguments pre-Civil War</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Author Deems These Silences Unfortunate, Not Adaptive  \n     \u2022 \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Emphasis on humility and moral ignorance; main lesson drawn from what was unsaid  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated focus on and moral indictment of the omissions of major contemporary concerns\u2014the enslaved, women, Native Americans, economic warnings, totalitarian threats\u2014and his appeal to humility over these silences clearly show that he is most perplexed by \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras.\u201d The intermittent, later-developed phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d is neither universal nor critiqued, and therefore cannot be the subject of equal perplexity.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe consistent use of one phrase\u201d as the perplexing element\n\n1. Core Claim  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly draws attention to presidents\u2019 dependence on a single rhetorical formula\u2014particularly \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d\u2014and finds it revealing of their evolving conception of the presidency.  \n   \u2022 He terms the speech a \u201cleader-preacher\u201d role, derives it from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d and notes how modern inaugurals \u201chit their stride\u201d in exhortation rather than policy detail.  \n\n2. Evidence of Perplexity  \n   \u2022 \u201cA telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cJohn F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times \u2026 Nixon \u2026 22 times\u201d</invalid_quote>. The author\u2019s precise counting indicates both fascination and unease at the formulaic repetition.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts this with earlier phases, implying that heavy reliance on exhortation represents a departure from reasoned argument: \u201cThis classification is not waterproof \u2026 But the trend is clear.\u201d His tone suggests skepticism that mere exhortation suffices.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s discussion of sentence-length decline (from 44 to 25 words) underscores his perplexity at the shift toward colloquial exhortations at the expense of substantive policy discourse.  \n\n3. Logical Significance  \n   \u2022 The \u201cLet us\u201d formula embodies the shift from governing by law to governing by inspiration; the author is unsettled by presidents assuming moral leadership over technical administration.  \n   \u2022 His repeated mention of technological media (radio, television) supports the view that he worries inaugurals have become entertainment rather than sober addresses.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cLack of Discussion of Hot Topics\u201d (Debater_A)  \n   A. Selective Emphasis  \n      \u2022 The author notes omissions (women, race, economic vulnerability) only to illustrate how content is shaped by rhetorical phase. He does not express the same \u201cperplexity\u201d or count omissions with statistical precision as he does the \u201cLet us\u201d formula.  \n      \u2022 Many inaugurals do address taxes (43 of 52). Omission of some topics is explained by historical context (\u201cIndians, \u2026 Prohibition \u2026 heard no more\u201d). These are episodic, not structural.  \n\n   B. Absence of Counted Metrics  \n      \u2022 For omissions, the author gives anecdotal examples, not systematic counts. His sustained quantitative focus on \u201cLet us\u201d usage indicates where his perplexity truly lies.  \n\n   C. Positive Mention vs. Perplexity  \n      \u2022 When inaugurals omit topics like race, he attributes it to shared public values and acceptability, not puzzlement at rhetorical style. He even absolves sincerity: \u201cI recall this not to suggest their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say.\u201d This neutral stance contrasts with his critical tone on the leader-preacher shift.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s detailed attention to, and uneasy reflection on, the proliferation of the \u201cLet us\u201d exhortation\u2014coupled with his analysis of style change\u2014demonstrates that this consistent phrase is the element that most perplexes him across inaugurals.  \n   \u2022 Omissions of particular topics are historical curiosities; the persistent rhetorical formula signals a fundamental transformation in the presidency and is therefore his chief concern.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nReading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe consistent use of one phrase\u201d as the perplexing element\n\n1. Core Claim  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly draws attention to presidents\u2019 dependence on a single rhetorical formula\u2014particularly \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d\u2014and finds it revealing of their evolving conception of the presidency.  \n   \u2022 He terms the speech a \u201cleader-preacher\u201d role, derives it from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d and notes how modern inaugurals \u201chit their stride\u201d in exhortation rather than policy detail.  \n\n2.

Kennedy repeated it 16 times \u2026 Nixon \u2026 22 times\u201d</invalid_quote>. The author\u2019s precise counting indicates both fascination and unease at the formulaic repetition.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts this with earlier phases, implying that heavy reliance on exhortation represents a departure from reasoned argument: \u201cThis classification is not waterproof \u2026 But the trend is clear.\u201d His tone suggests skepticism that mere exhortation suffices.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s discussion of sentence-length decline (from 44 to 25 words) underscores his perplexity at the shift toward colloquial exhortations at the expense of substantive policy discourse.  \n\n3. Logical Significance  \n   \u2022 The \u201cLet us\u201d formula embodies the shift from governing by law to governing by inspiration; the author is unsettled by presidents assuming moral leadership over technical administration.  \n   \u2022 His repeated mention of technological media (radio, television) supports the view that he worries inaugurals have become entertainment rather than sober addresses.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cLack of Discussion of Hot Topics\u201d (Debater_A)  \n   A. Selective Emphasis  \n      \u2022 The author notes omissions (women, race, economic vulnerability) only to illustrate how content is shaped by rhetorical phase. He does not express the same \u201cperplexity\u201d or count omissions with statistical precision as he does the \u201cLet us\u201d formula.  \n      \u2022 Many inaugurals do address taxes (43 of 52). Omission of some topics is explained by historical context (\u201cIndians, \u2026 Prohibition \u2026 heard no more\u201d). These are episodic, not structural.  \n\n   B. Absence of Counted Metrics  \n      \u2022 For omissions, the author gives anecdotal examples, not systematic counts. His sustained quantitative focus on \u201cLet us\u201d usage indicates where his perplexity truly lies.  \n\n   C. Positive Mention vs. Perplexity  \n      \u2022 When inaugurals omit topics like race, he attributes it to shared public values and acceptability, not puzzlement at rhetorical style. He even absolves sincerity: \u201cI recall this not to suggest their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say.\u201d This neutral stance contrasts with his critical tone on the leader-preacher shift.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s detailed attention to, and uneasy reflection on, the proliferation of the \u201cLet us\u201d exhortation\u2014coupled with his analysis of style change\u2014demonstrates that this consistent phrase is the element that most perplexes him across inaugurals.  \n   \u2022 Omissions of particular topics are historical curiosities; the persistent rhetorical formula signals a fundamental transformation in the presidency and is therefore his chief concern.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for \u201cThe Lack of Discussion of Hot Topics\u201d Position\n\n1.

Such moral language (\u201cdisturbing,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cshake their heads\u201d) signals genuine perplexity.  \n    \u2022 By contrast, discussion of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and media effects is descriptive\u2014\u201ctelltale sign,\u201d \u201cderived their license,\u201d \u201creflects change in audience\u201d (<invalid_quote>Presidents derived their license \u2026 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s remark that the presidency was \u2018a bully pulpit\u2019</invalid_quote>). No moral judgment or call for humility accompanies it.  \n\n  b. Appeal to Humility Rooted in Silences  \n    \u2022 He concludes by urging humility based on what we (and past presidents) failed to address (<quote>We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing</quote>). The \u201cwe\u201d refers to omissions of critical issues, not mere rhetorical style.  \n\n2. Breadth and Systematic Repetition of Omissions  \n  a. Multiple Issue Categories  \n    \u2022 Race: \u201cwords \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 \u2026 do not appear \u2026 until Rutherford Hayes, 1877,\u201d and FDR never mentions it in four inaugurals.  \n    \u2022 Women: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural.\u201d  \n    \u2022 Indians, polygamy, Prohibition, economic warnings (Hoover 1929), totalitarian threats (FDR 1937).  \n  b. Recurrence Across Eras  \n    \u2022 These silences span antebellum, post\u2013Civil War, pre\u2013New Deal, and post\u2013World War II eras, indicating a pervasive problem, not isolated episodes.  \n  c. Author\u2019s Repeated Returns  \n    \u2022 The article devotes distinct sections to each omission, sometimes with historical context explaining why omission was \u201cunmentionable,\u201d yet still views it as a failure.  \n\n3. \u201cLet Us\u201d Is Neither Universal Nor Problematic  \n  a. Limited Chronology  \n    \u2022 Rare in first two phases; \u201cappears occasionally\u201d and \u201chit its stride in recent years\u201d only after mass media (<invalid_quote>This expression appears occasionally \u2026 but it has hit its stride in recent years</invalid_quote>). A truly perplexing feature would be constant across all 53 addresses.  \n  b. Technological and Audience Explanation  \n    \u2022 Sentence-length decline is cited as \u201creflect[ing] the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication\u201d (<invalid_quote>I do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but it does reflect the change \u2026</invalid_quote>). This approval of adaptation undermines the claim of perplexity.  \n  c. Lack of Moral or Critical Framing  \n    \u2022 No admonition that \u201cLet us\u201d is misguided or that future readers will regret the shift toward exhortation. Instead, it is presented as a logical outgrowth of the \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d  \n\n4. Opponent\u2019s Misreading of Quantitative Focus  \n  a. Counting vs. Concern  \n    \u2022 Quantitative mention of \u201cLet us\u201d serves to illustrate the stylistic phase, not to quantify a problem. By contrast, race and women omissions are quantified in terms of inaugural count (e.g., \u201c43 of the 52 inaugural addresses\u201d treat taxes; absence of women until Wilson).  \n  b. Narrative Emphasis  \n    \u2022 The piece\u2019s structure devotes more narrative space and concluding reflection to silences than to the \u201cLet us\u201d shift. The final exhortation to humility hinges on ignorance and moral \u201cobtuseness,\u201d not on rhetorical formulae.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence with Author\u2019s Purpose  \n  \u2022 Goal: reading inaugurals as mirrors of their times, revealing citizens\u2019 \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness.\u201d Only omissions of pressing moral and political issues achieve this mirror function\u2014style changes merely reflect audience reach, not moral stance.  \n  \u2022 Author praises \u201creasonableness and moderation\u201d of past presidents but laments their \u201cignorance\u201d of human rights crises. One does not lament a shorter sentence length but does lament a denial of slavery or neglect of women\u2019s rights.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated moral language, broad treatment of omissions across authors and eras, and concluding call for humility about what is unsaid demonstrate that his true perplexity lies in presidents\u2019 failure to address major contemporary issues. The \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d formula, by contrast, is a explicable, neutral stylistic development, not a source of moral or historical concern. Therefore, \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics\u201d is unmistakably the element that most perplexes the author.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe Consistent Use of One Phrase\u201d as the Author\u2019s Central Perplexity\n\n1. The Author\u2019s Quantitative Fixation on \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d  \n  a. Systematic Counting  \n    \u2022 The author provides exact tallies: <invalid_quote>\u201cJohn F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times \u2026 Richard Nixon \u2026 22 times\u201d</invalid_quote>. Such precision indicates sustained scrutiny and surprise at its proliferation across inaugurals, not mere passing mention.  \n  b. Labeling as \u201cTelltale Sign\u201d  \n    \u2022 He calls this usage \u201ca telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural,\u201d linking it to a fundamental evolution of presidential rhetoric and suggesting it is diagnostic and noteworthy. <invalid_quote>\u201cPresidents derived their license \u2026 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s remark that the presidency was \u2018a bully pulpit\u2019 \u2026 This expression \u2026 has hit its stride in recent years.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  c. Emphasis on Media-Driven Change  \n    \u2022 He highlights radio and television\u2019s role in magnifying this exhortative style, implying discomfort that policy is supplanted by oratory: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe metaphor of the pulpit suggests \u2026 oral and visual contact \u2026 made \u2026 possible on a national scale.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. Perplexity Reflected in Style Analysis  \n  a. Sentence-Length Decline  \n    \u2022 He records a drop from 44 words/sentence (Washington\u2013Buchanan) to 34 (Lincoln\u2013Wilson) to 25 (since Wilson). His explicit presentation of these figures demonstrates analytical concern about how brevity and colloquialism (including \u201cLet us\u201d) have transformed substance into sermonizing.  \n  b. Tone of Sober Skepticism  \n    \u2022 He qualifies the trend as \u201cnot waterproof\u201d and \u201cmetamorphosed \u2026 from describing policy to inspiring behavior,\u201d betraying unease that inaugurals have become theatrical \u201cleader-preacher\u201d addresses rather than measured statements of governance.  \n\n3. Omissions Are Contextual and Episodic, Not Perplexing  \n  a. Historical Constraints Explain Silences  \n    \u2022 Modesty to dispel monarchy fears (<invalid_quote>\u201cinheriting inferior endowments \u2026 ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies\u201d</invalid_quote>), Southern appeasement (<invalid_quote>slavery \u201cshould not be interfered with\u201d to preserve the Union</invalid_quote>), or technological and audience limits. These silences serve strategic purposes, not sources of the author\u2019s bewilderment.  \n  b. Lack of Systematic Quantification  \n    \u2022 On women and race he offers anecdotal counts (\u201cdoes not appear \u2026 until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural,\u201d \u201cdoes not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes\u201d), but provides no repeated tallies or statistical analysis comparable to \u201cLet us.\u201d He does not track the frequency of omissions across speeches or phases, signaling that these are curiosities, not core puzzles.  \n  c. Neutral to Positive Treatment of Content  \n    \u2022 He defends shorter sentences as not a \u201cdeterioration,\u201d and often explains omissions as \u201cacceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans.\u201d This neutral or even justificatory tone contrasts sharply with his critical focus on the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d style.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cLack of Discussion of Hot Topics\u201d as Chief Perplexity  \n  a. \u201cMost Disturbing\u201d vs. \u201cPerplexing Trend\u201d  \n    \u2022 Describing race omissions as \u201cdisturbing\u201d is a moral judgment, not analytical perplexity about rhetorical evolution. It underscores disapproval of past values, not bewilderment at the pattern of speech form.  \n  b. Singularity vs. Ubiquity  \n    \u2022 Omission of, say, economic warnings in Hoover\u2019s lone inaugural or women pre-Wilson are isolated episodes. By contrast, \u201cLet us\u201d spans multiple administrations and marks the very definition of the third phase. The author traces its ascent from rarity to ubiquity, a pattern that demands explanation.  \n  c. Relation to Presidency\u2019s Changing Role  \n    \u2022 The author explicitly links \u201cLet us\u201d to a redefined presidency that \u201ccould not manage by using the instruments of government alone\u201d and needed to \u201cuplift the people.\u201d His detailed exploration shows he is wrestling with whether oratory has overshadowed governance\u2014a fundamental, ongoing issue.  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The author\u2019s meticulous enumeration of \u201cLet us\u201d instances, coupled with style metrics and repeated references to media\u2019s magnification of the exhortative model, reveals this consistent phrase as the element that most perplexes him.  \n  \u2022 While he notes omissions of hot-button issues, he interprets them through historical and strategic lenses, without the same analytical intensity or critical concern he reserves for the inexorable rise of the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inaugural.  \n  \u2022 Therefore, the core perplexity in reading the inaugurals lies in the persistent, quantifiable exhortation encapsulated by \u201cLet us \u2026,\u201d signaling a shift in political authority and the nature of public persuasion.\n\n\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
