    "background_text": "Castaways of Eros By NELSON S. BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" ",

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMore confident survival with a dry landing\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Loss of critical supplies undermined morale and forced hesitation  \n  a. \u201cWe seem to be under water!\u201d (II) flooded the Cuchulainn, ruined \u201cflour and sugar and things like that\u201d and forced an emergency evacuation (II).  \n  b. They were compelled to subsist on \u201csyntho eggs\u201d \u201cthat tasted \u2026 awful,\u201d and \u201csyntho \u2026 coffee\u201d (III), underscoring their dependence on limited, artificial food while awaiting uncertain agriculture.  \n  c. Pop himself admits the need to \u201cworry about \u2026 food, clothing, furniture\u201d later (II) and that \u201cit will take time\u201d to restore \u201catomic power\u201d and raise the ship (III). This anxiety would vanish or be vastly diminished with intact supplies.\n\n2. Delayed establishment of permanent base and exploration  \n  a. Dry landing would have enabled immediate off\u2010loading of tools, the \u201chypatomic,\u201d and \u201cguns, wire\u201d essential for repair and defense, rather than racing for the airlock in bulky suits (II).  \n  b. They \u201cmight as well move\u201d only after salvaging minimal items; a dry ship would serve as fallback shelter and storage for weeks to come (III). Without damage, Pop\u2019s plan for \u201csettlement \u2026 on yonder knoll\u201d (III) proceeds without the pressing need to scavenge and ration.\n\n3. Confidence to resume space\u2010craft operations and rescue missions  \n  a. With the ship afloat, Dick could \u201ctest \u2026 drives,\u201d \u201ccut drives at \u2026 precisely\u201d to reposition or signal for rescue or reapproach at better rotational phase (I). Their \u201cluck\u201d in calm seas cannot be relied upon in the long run. A dry ship preserves mobility.  \n  b. Debater_B ignores that Eros \u201crotates \u2026 in about ten hours,\u201d giving only five\u2010hour days (III). A non\u2010water landing would allow them to wait for \u201cdaylight\u201d landing at their chosen site, retaining full control, instead of a powerless crash that forced a beachhead.\n\n4. Attack on \u201ctemporary supplies\u201d argument (Debater_B)  \n  a. B\u2019s claim of indifference to supply loss ignores the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on ruined goods and synthesizers\u2019 inferiority. \u201cThey can\u2019t settle until \u2026\u201d (III) \u2013 \u201ctime \u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied,\u201d not poor rations.  \n  b. B underestimates the psychological need for security. Pop\u2019s decorum and Grampaw\u2019s grousing over \u201csynthos\u201d show that satisfaction of basic needs is urgent: they \u201cmight \u2026 fret\u201d under constant fear of ship loss.  \n  c. B fails to explain why Dick risked repeated attempts to lift the ship (II) if they were content to abandon it. Clearly, intact ship equaled greater confidence and options.\n\nConclusion  \nA dry\u2010landing would have preserved critical supplies, provided safe shelter, allowed methodical establishment of saline\u2010free agriculture, and enabled controlled experiments with Eros\u2019s rotation and rescue logistics. This fosters confidence and accelerates settlement. The flood landing robbed them of security, delayed progress, and forced reliance on substandard provisions. Thus the family\u2019s attitude in their first days would have been far more optimistic, proactive, and self\u2010reliant had they not lost so much to the inundation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that, even if the Cuchulainn had landed on dry ground instead of in water, the Moseley family\u2019s attitude during their first days on Eros would have been largely unchanged. They understood from the start that their Earth\u2010supplied provisions and power were only temporary. Their goal was to establish permanent resources\u2014water, food crops, shelter, power\u2014regardless of initial landing conditions.\n\n2. Argument 1: Supplies Were Known to Be Temporary  \n   a. \u201cFirst we must establish our claims\u2026 That means work, plenty of hard work. After that\u2026 consider a mining operation.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (I.46\u201349)  \n   b. \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness.\u201d <quote>Dick</quote> (II.239\u2013241)  \n   c. They immediately look for a fertile valley, fresh water, and build a settlement\u2014fish, game, \u201cstart crops\u201d (III.325\u2013328).  \n   \u21d2 From the outset, their dependence on Earth supplies was limited. A dry landing would not allay or delay their need to secure sustainable resources on Eros, so their determination and confidence remained the same.\n\n3. Argument 2: Rapid Salvage and Repair Would Still Be Needed  \n   a. Even on land, the ship\u2019s prow was split and unusable until refloated and repaired (\u201cThe whole prow split wide open\u2026 The ship is full of water,\u201d II.238\u2013240). On ground, they would face similar irreparable damage from impact.  \n   b. \u201cTime\u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (III.311\u2013312) They do not panic but methodically plan inland move.  \n   \u21d2 Whether waterlogged or strewn on rocks, the ship needed atomic power restoration and salvage operations. Their calm perseverance demonstrates unaffected attitude.\n\n4. Argument 3: Psychological Confidence Rooted in Vision, Not Floating Crate  \n   a. Pop\u2019s speech on carving a new home and \u201cdeep, instinctive longing\u201d to hew virgin land (I.337\u2013342) shows their morale derives from pioneering spirit, unaffected by landing mode.  \n   b. Upon reaching delta, they christen \u201cDelta Port\u201d and set to work immediately (III.353\u2013358). They never dwell bitterly on the wet landing.  \n   \u21d2 Their optimism and confidence lie in colonization vision and \u201cland\u2010grant\u201d rights, not in initial technical success of a dry touchdown.\n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claim  \n   A1: Debater_A claims loss of supplies undermined confidence.  \n     - Evidence shows they easily salvage \u201ctools, guns, wire\u201d (III.318\u2013320) and iterate for more through hunting and farming. They never consider returning or despairing.  \n     - Debater_A offers no evidence that a dry landing would have given them any additional supplies beyond what they already judged temporary.  \n   A2: They accept syntho\u2010food (\u201cI can eat \u2019em but ain\u2019t gonna like \u2019em,\u201d III.308\u2013310) without complaint beyond taste, never fear starvation.  \n     - They welcome moving inland \u201cwhile Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast\u201d only four days after crash (III.297\u2013303). Food insecurity is not paramount.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The crux of the Moseleys\u2019 first days on Eros was securing permanent sustenance\u2014water, land, crops, energy\u2014independent of initial landing conditions. A dry landing would not supply water or fertile soil; the ship still required repair. Their unshakable pioneer spirit and methodical progress demonstrate their attitude would have been largely unaffected.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nCastaways of Eros By NELSON S. BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that, even if the Cuchulainn had landed on dry ground instead of in water, the Moseley family\u2019s attitude during their first days on Eros would have been largely unchanged. They understood from the start that their Earth\u2010supplied provisions and power were only temporary. Their goal was to establish permanent resources\u2014water, food crops, shelter, power\u2014regardless of initial landing conditions.\n\n2. Argument 1: Supplies Were Known to Be Temporary  \n   a. \u201cFirst we must establish our claims\u2026 That means work, plenty of hard work. After that\u2026 consider a mining operation.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (I.46\u201349)  \n   b. \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness.\u201d <quote>Dick</quote> (II.239\u2013241)  \n   c. They immediately look for a fertile valley, fresh water, and build a settlement\u2014fish, game, \u201cstart crops\u201d (III.325\u2013328).  \n   \u21d2 From the outset, their dependence on Earth supplies was limited. A dry landing would not allay or delay their need to secure sustainable resources on Eros, so their determination and confidence remained the same.\n\n3. Argument 2: Rapid Salvage and Repair Would Still Be Needed  \n   a. Even on land, the ship\u2019s prow was split and unusable until refloated and repaired (\u201cThe whole prow split wide open\u2026 The ship is full of water,\u201d II.238\u2013240). On ground, they would face similar irreparable damage from impact.  \n   b. \u201cTime\u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (III.311\u2013312) They do not panic but methodically plan inland move.  \n   \u21d2 Whether waterlogged or strewn on rocks, the ship needed atomic power restoration and salvage operations. Their calm perseverance demonstrates unaffected attitude.\n\n4. Argument 3: Psychological Confidence Rooted in Vision, Not Floating Crate  \n   a. Pop\u2019s speech on carving a new home and \u201cdeep, instinctive longing\u201d to hew virgin land (I.337\u2013342) shows their morale derives from pioneering spirit, unaffected by landing mode.  \n   b. Upon reaching delta, they christen \u201cDelta Port\u201d and set to work immediately (III.353\u2013358). They never dwell bitterly on the wet landing.  \n   \u21d2 Their optimism and confidence lie in colonization vision and \u201cland\u2010grant\u201d rights, not in initial technical success of a dry touchdown.\n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claim  \n   A1: Debater_A claims loss of supplies undermined confidence.  \n     - Evidence shows they easily salvage \u201ctools, guns, wire\u201d (III.318\u2013320) and iterate for more through hunting and farming. They never consider returning or despairing.  \n     - Debater_A offers no evidence that a dry landing would have given them any additional supplies beyond what they already judged temporary.  \n   A2: They accept syntho\u2010food (\u201cI can eat \u2019em but ain\u2019t gonna like \u2019em,\u201d III.308\u2013310) without complaint beyond taste, never fear starvation.  \n     - They welcome moving inland \u201cwhile Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast\u201d only four days after crash (III.297\u2013303). Food insecurity is not paramount.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The crux of the Moseleys\u2019 first days on Eros was securing permanent sustenance\u2014water, land, crops, energy\u2014independent of initial landing conditions. A dry landing would not supply water or fertile soil; the ship still required repair. Their unshakable pioneer spirit and methodical progress demonstrate their attitude would have been largely unaffected.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMore confident survival with a dry landing\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Loss of critical supplies undermined morale and forced hesitation  \n  a. \u201cWe seem to be under water!\u201d (II) flooded the Cuchulainn, ruined \u201cflour and sugar and things like that\u201d and forced an emergency evacuation (II).  \n  b. They were compelled to subsist on \u201csyntho eggs\u201d \u201cthat tasted \u2026 awful,\u201d and \u201csyntho \u2026 coffee\u201d (III), underscoring their dependence on limited, artificial food while awaiting uncertain agriculture.  \n  c. Pop himself admits the need to \u201cworry about \u2026 food, clothing, furniture\u201d later (II) and that \u201cit will take time\u201d to restore \u201catomic power\u201d and raise the ship (III). This anxiety would vanish or be vastly diminished with intact supplies.\n\n2. Delayed establishment of permanent base and exploration  \n  a. Dry landing would have enabled immediate off\u2010loading of tools, the \u201chypatomic,\u201d and \u201cguns, wire\u201d essential for repair and defense, rather than racing for the airlock in bulky suits (II).  \n  b. They \u201cmight as well move\u201d only after salvaging minimal items; a dry ship would serve as fallback shelter and storage for weeks to come (III). Without damage, Pop\u2019s plan for \u201csettlement \u2026 on yonder knoll\u201d (III) proceeds without the pressing need to scavenge and ration.\n\n3. Confidence to resume space\u2010craft operations and rescue missions  \n  a. With the ship afloat, Dick could \u201ctest \u2026 drives,\u201d \u201ccut drives at \u2026 precisely\u201d to reposition or signal for rescue or reapproach at better rotational phase (I). Their \u201cluck\u201d in calm seas cannot be relied upon in the long run. A dry ship preserves mobility.  \n  b. Debater_B ignores that Eros \u201crotates \u2026 in about ten hours,\u201d giving only five\u2010hour days (III). A non\u2010water landing would allow them to wait for \u201cdaylight\u201d landing at their chosen site, retaining full control, instead of a powerless crash that forced a beachhead.\n\n4. Attack on \u201ctemporary supplies\u201d argument (Debater_B)  \n  a. B\u2019s claim of indifference to supply loss ignores the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on ruined goods and synthesizers\u2019 inferiority. \u201cThey can\u2019t settle until \u2026\u201d (III) \u2013 \u201ctime \u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied,\u201d not poor rations.  \n  b. B underestimates the psychological need for security. Pop\u2019s decorum and Grampaw\u2019s grousing over \u201csynthos\u201d show that satisfaction of basic needs is urgent: they \u201cmight \u2026 fret\u201d under constant fear of ship loss.  \n  c. B fails to explain why Dick risked repeated attempts to lift the ship (II) if they were content to abandon it.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMore confident survival with a dry landing\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Loss of critical supplies undermined morale and forced hesitation  \n  a. \u201cWe seem to be under water!\u201d (II) flooded the Cuchulainn, ruined \u201cflour and sugar and things like that\u201d and forced an emergency evacuation (II).  \n  b. They were compelled to subsist on \u201csyntho eggs\u201d \u201cthat tasted \u2026 awful,\u201d and \u201csyntho \u2026 coffee\u201d (III), underscoring their dependence on limited, artificial food while awaiting uncertain agriculture.  \n  c. Pop himself admits the need to \u201cworry about \u2026 food, clothing, furniture\u201d later (II) and that \u201cit will take time\u201d to restore \u201catomic power\u201d and raise the ship (III). This anxiety would vanish or be vastly diminished with intact supplies.\n\n2. Delayed establishment of permanent base and exploration  \n  a. Dry landing would have enabled immediate off\u2010loading of tools, the \u201chypatomic,\u201d and \u201cguns, wire\u201d essential for repair and defense, rather than racing for the airlock in bulky suits (II).  \n  b. They \u201cmight as well move\u201d only after salvaging minimal items; a dry ship would serve as fallback shelter and storage for weeks to come (III). Without damage, Pop\u2019s plan for \u201csettlement \u2026 on yonder knoll\u201d (III) proceeds without the pressing need to scavenge and ration.\n\n3. Confidence to resume space\u2010craft operations and rescue missions  \n  a. With the ship afloat, Dick could \u201ctest \u2026 drives,\u201d \u201ccut drives at \u2026 precisely\u201d to reposition or signal for rescue or reapproach at better rotational phase (I). Their \u201cluck\u201d in calm seas cannot be relied upon in the long run. A dry ship preserves mobility.  \n  b. Debater_B ignores that Eros \u201crotates \u2026 in about ten hours,\u201d giving only five\u2010hour days (III). A non\u2010water landing would allow them to wait for \u201cdaylight\u201d landing at their chosen site, retaining full control, instead of a powerless crash that forced a beachhead.\n\n4. Attack on \u201ctemporary supplies\u201d argument (Debater_B)  \n  a. B\u2019s claim of indifference to supply loss ignores the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on ruined goods and synthesizers\u2019 inferiority. \u201cThey can\u2019t settle until \u2026\u201d (III) \u2013 \u201ctime \u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied,\u201d not poor rations.  \n  b. B underestimates the psychological need for security. Pop\u2019s decorum and Grampaw\u2019s grousing over \u201csynthos\u201d show that satisfaction of basic needs is urgent: they \u201cmight \u2026 fret\u201d under constant fear of ship loss.  \n  c. B fails to explain why Dick risked repeated attempts to lift the ship (II) if they were content to abandon it. Clearly, intact ship equaled greater confidence and options.\n\nConclusion  \nA dry\u2010landing would have preserved critical supplies, provided safe shelter, allowed methodical establishment of saline\u2010free agriculture, and enabled controlled experiments with Eros\u2019s rotation and rescue logistics. This fosters confidence and accelerates settlement. The flood landing robbed them of security, delayed progress, and forced reliance on substandard provisions. Thus the family\u2019s attitude in their first days would have been far more optimistic, proactive, and self\u2010reliant had they not lost so much to the inundation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that, even if the Cuchulainn had landed on dry ground instead of in water, the Moseley family\u2019s attitude during their first days on Eros would have been largely unchanged. They understood from the start that their Earth\u2010supplied provisions and power were only temporary. Their goal was to establish permanent resources\u2014water, food crops, shelter, power\u2014regardless of initial landing conditions.\n\n2. Argument 1: Supplies Were Known to Be Temporary  \n   a. \u201cFirst we must establish our claims\u2026 That means work, plenty of hard work. After that\u2026 consider a mining operation.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (I.46\u201349)  \n   b. \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness.\u201d <quote>Dick</quote> (II.239\u2013241)  \n   c. They immediately look for a fertile valley, fresh water, and build a settlement\u2014fish, game, \u201cstart crops\u201d (III.325\u2013328).  \n   \u21d2 From the outset, their dependence on Earth supplies was limited. A dry landing would not allay or delay their need to secure sustainable resources on Eros, so their determination and confidence remained the same.\n\n3. Argument 2: Rapid Salvage and Repair Would Still Be Needed  \n   a. Even on land, the ship\u2019s prow was split and unusable until refloated and repaired (\u201cThe whole prow split wide open\u2026 The ship is full of water,\u201d II.238\u2013240). On ground, they would face similar irreparable damage from impact.  \n   b. \u201cTime\u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (III.311\u2013312) They do not panic but methodically plan inland move.  \n   \u21d2 Whether waterlogged or strewn on rocks, the ship needed atomic power restoration and salvage operations. Their calm perseverance demonstrates unaffected attitude.\n\n4. Argument 3: Psychological Confidence Rooted in Vision, Not Floating Crate  \n   a. Pop\u2019s speech on carving a new home and \u201cdeep, instinctive longing\u201d to hew virgin land (I.337\u2013342) shows their morale derives from pioneering spirit, unaffected by landing mode.  \n   b. Upon reaching delta, they christen \u201cDelta Port\u201d and set to work immediately (III.353\u2013358). They never dwell bitterly on the wet landing.  \n   \u21d2 Their optimism and confidence lie in colonization vision and \u201cland\u2010grant\u201d rights, not in initial technical success of a dry touchdown.\n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claim  \n   A1: Debater_A claims loss of supplies undermined confidence.  \n     - Evidence shows they easily salvage \u201ctools, guns, wire\u201d (III.318\u2013320) and iterate for more through hunting and farming. They never consider returning or despairing.  \n     - Debater_A offers no evidence that a dry landing would have given them any additional supplies beyond what they already judged temporary.  \n   A2: They accept syntho\u2010food (\u201cI can eat \u2019em but ain\u2019t gonna like \u2019em,\u201d III.308\u2013310) without complaint beyond taste, never fear starvation.  \n     - They welcome moving inland \u201cwhile Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast\u201d only four days after crash (III.297\u2013303). Food insecurity is not paramount.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The crux of the Moseleys\u2019 first days on Eros was securing permanent sustenance\u2014water, land, crops, energy\u2014independent of initial landing conditions. A dry landing would not supply water or fertile soil; the ship still required repair. Their unshakable pioneer spirit and methodical progress demonstrate their attitude would have been largely unaffected.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMore Confident Survival with Dry Landing\u201d (Affirmative)\n\n1. A Flooded Ship Severely Eroded Their Security and Morale  \n  a. \u201cWe seem to be under water!\u201d (II.200\u2013201) forced an unplanned evacuation in clumsy bulgers, carrying only minimal items (\u201cSome tools, guns, wire\u201d\u2014II.238\u2013239). A dry landing would preserve the entire cargo: foodstuffs, clothing, habitation gear, medical kit, tool\u2010boxes.  \n  b. Ruined \u201cflour and sugar and things like that\u201d left them to subsist on \u201csyntho eggs \u2026 awful\u201d (III.305\u2013308). Their own words reveal disgust and relief only at moving inland \u201cwhile Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast\u201d four days later (III.297\u2013303). With intact provisions, they would enjoy real food, sustain morale, and avoid the constant psychological strain of \u201ctime \u2026 over\u2010supplied\u201d but \u201cworried\u201d about famine (III.311\u2013312).\n\n2. Dry Landing Permits Controlled, Daylight Operations and Safer Settlement  \n  a. They \u201cforgot \u2026 diurnal revolution\u201d and \u201cland in the dark\u201d (II.181\u2013184), risking damage. A dry, controlled touchdown at \u201cfive\u2010hour\u201d daylight would allow Pop to \u201cselect a fertile valley,\u201d survey \u201cdelta islands,\u201d and build \u201cpermanent camp\u2010site\u201d without haste and risk (III.320\u2013328). They waste no time, but the actual text shows delay: \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship \u2026 it will take time\u201d (III.311\u2013313). A dry ship means they could postpone inland move until fully prepared.  \n  b. Dick\u2019s repeated, unsuccessful jettison attempts (\u201cThe ship rocked \u2026 but did not move\u201d II.225\u2013227) illustrate immobilization. A dry vessel retains mobility to reposition, seek better anchorage, return for supplies, or signal SSP patrols, maintaining strategic confidence rather than isolation on an unknown beach.\n\n3. Retained Atomic Power and Emergency Shelter Are Critical  \n  a. \u201cWe\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness\u201d (II.239\u2013241). Flood damage disabled hypatomics, forcing manual, time\u2010consuming work in the wild. A dry ship retains reactors and lights, enabling immediate experiments with \u201csearch\u2010beams\u201d (II.190\u2013191) and geologic surveys to locate resources safely.  \n  b. The intact Cuchulainn serves as fail\u2010safe refuge against storms, unknown predators (\u201corange and jade\u2010green bird,\u201d III.273\u2013275), and cold nights. Its bulkhead shelter is more reliable than \u201cbulgers\u201d on a sandy beach.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAttitude Unchanged\u201d Claim  \n  a. B overlooks repeated expressions of urgency: \u201cWe can\u2019t get fresh foods until we\u2019re settled\u201d (II.201\u2013203); \u201cwe'll worry about that later\u201d implies reluctance, not indifference. If truly unconcerned, they would not salvage every last tool or effort to refloat a sinking vessel.  \n  b. B\u2019s \u201cship damage inevitable on land\u201d theory ignores that a daylight, controlled dry touchdown with stern rockets alone would minimize impact (\u201cstern rockets only\u2014Comets to you\u201d\u2014I.159\u2013162). They knew proper procedures; darkness, not ground, caused crash.  \n  c. B\u2019s reliance on \u201cpioneer spirit\u201d (I.337\u2013342) cannot overcome basic human needs. Hunger, cold, and exposure blunt pioneer zeal. The Moseleys\u2019 priority is survival\u2014Pop\u2019s caution (\u201cPerhaps it isn\u2019t right \u2026\u201d I.80\u201383) shows prudence. A dry landing would validate Pop\u2019s and Dick\u2019s competence, bolstering collective confidence rather than stoking Grampaw\u2019s grousing (\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna like \u2019em\u201d\u2014III.308\u2013310).\n\n5. Dry Landing Accelerates Settlement and Resource Development  \n  a. With native \u201cfurry beasts\u201d (III.263\u2013267) and \u201cradiant spring\u201d (III.323) to exploit, they could proceed at leisure to \u201chew a new home\u201d (I.341\u2013342). A dry ship provides laboratories to conduct soil tests, greenhouse cultivation, and safe storage of seeds, vastly shortening the four\u2010day cafeteria stage they endured.  \n  b. For \u201cmining operation\u2026 justify right to own Eros\u201d (I.46\u201349), they need evidence of sustained habitation. A dry\u2010landed, operational ship attests to permanence and capacity to meet \u201cland\u2010grant obligations\u201d (I.44\u201345). Sinking would jeopardize their legal claim.\n\nConclusion  \nThe text emphatically shows that water damage risked starvation, isolation, and ship immobility, while the Moseleys\u2019 anxiety and haste only begin to subside after invasive, time\u2010consuming salvage and relocation. A dry landing, in daylight, preserving all supplies, shelter, power, and legal posture, would have yielded a markedly more confident, proactive, and methodical start to colonization. Therefore, the family\u2019s attitude would have been far more self\u2010assured and less encumbered by constant survival anxiety had the ship not landed in the water.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that whether the Cuchulainn struck water or hard ground, the Moseleys\u2019 mindset during their first days would remain essentially the same. From the outset, they viewed their Earth\u2010brought provisions, power source, and shelter as provisional. Their priority\u2014and confidence\u2014stemmed from quickly establishing permanent resources on Eros. A dry touchdown would not eliminate the challenges of repair, sustainability, or the colonizing work ahead.\n\n2. Supplies and Shelter Were Always Temporary  \n   a. Pop\u2019s own words: \u201cFirst we must establish our claims\u2026it means work, plenty of hard work. After that\u2026consider a mining operation.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (I.46\u201349). He never anticipates living indefinitely off the Cuchulainn\u2019s stores.  \n   b. Dick\u2019s insistence: \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power\u2026atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness.\u201d <quote>Dick</quote> (II.239\u2013241). Restoration of the ship is meant for long\u2010term objectives (mining, shipping), not immediate survival.  \n   c. Four Eros days after crash, without drama, \u201cMom and Eleanor [are] fixing breakfast\u201d in their shore camp; Pop immediately scouts inland \u201cto build\u2026start crops\u201d (III.325\u2013328). They never consider returning to the ship for daily sustenance.  \n   \u21d2 Regardless of landing medium, they would swiftly transfer to shore and pursue self\u2010sufficiency, viewing ship repairs as a secondary, longer\u2010term endeavor.\n\n3. Ship Impact Would Damage Critical Systems on Land Too  \n   a. Debater_A concedes \u201cthe whole prow split wide open\u201d and the vessel \u201cfull of water\u201d only after repeated failed jet tests (II.238\u2013240). On land, a high\u2010velocity impact into rock or uneven terrain would equally \u201cstove in\u201d nose sections and rupture tanks; \u201cwe can\u2019t get loose\u201d proves uncontrollable even on \u201ccalm seas.\u201d  \n   b. \u201cTime\u2026is the one commodity with which we are over\u2010supplied.\u201d <quote>Pop</quote> (III.311\u2013312). Their calm methodical plan to move inland and repair at leisure indicates that lack of shelter is not seriously undermining morale. They remain \u201coptimistic,\u201d never mention fear or desire for rescue beyond self\u2010reliance.  \n   \u21d2 A dry landing wouldn\u2019t spare critical atomic machinery, nor accelerate safe recovery; they still face ten-hour rotation, imperfect lighting, and must \u201cworry\u201d about self\u2010sustenance first.\n\n4. Psychological Confidence Rooted in Pioneering Spirit  \n   a. Pop\u2019s vision: \u201cdeep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u201d (I.337\u2013342). Their morale thrives on colonist ideals, not on floating fallback. They \u201cchristen\u201d \u201cDelta Port\u201d and gather firewood, attire, and blankets for inland life (III.353\u2013358).  \n   b. Grampaw\u2019s only gripe is \u201csynthos\u2026 ain\u2019t got no flavor\u201d (III.308\u2013310), not fear of starvation. His grousing is superficial; he readily accepts the place\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d virtues (III.282\u2013284).  \n   \u21d2 Their buoyancy originates in exploration zeal and legal land\u2010grant rights (\u201crich little planet\u2026the man who earns it wins a rich prize,\u201d I.142\u2013145), independent of initial landing perfection.\n\n5. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Key Points  \n   A1: \u201cCritical supplies undermined morale and forced hesitation.\u201d  \n     - Morale never flags; they never debate abandoning Eros or panic despite \u201cawful\u201d syntho\u2010foods. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate, son,\u201d says Pop of a four\u2010day journey (I.140\u2013141). A \u201ctough break\u201d is mere technical hurdle, not existential crisis.  \n   A2: \u201cDelayed establishment\u2026ship as fallback.\u201d  \n     - They leave \u201cbeach camp-site\u201d permanently four days post\u2010crash, hauling minimal relics (III.297\u2013303). If the ship were secure, they would not abandon it so completely to build a new \u201chome on yonder knoll\u201d immediately.  \n   A3: \u201cConfidence to resume spacecraft operations.\u201d  \n     - Even if ship floats dry, they must wait \u201cdiurnal rotation\u201d and spend \u201ctime\u201d on repairs. The practicality of repopulating Delta Port and starting agriculture outweighs uncertain hopes of rescue or rotation alignment. Their settlement is \u201crich,\u201d their rights assured; external rescue unnecessary.  \n   A4: Undervaluing pioneer resourcefulness.  \n     - Debater_A ignores their discovery of game (\u201cleaf\u2010green\u2026rabbit,\u201d III.332\u2013336), fresh river water, and natural materials. These confirm that Eros sustains them without ship\u2010based resources.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The text demonstrates the Moseleys\u2019 confidence springs from colonist determination and rapid engagement with Eros\u2019s environment. Whether wet\u2010landed or dry, they would still transfer to the shore, prioritize water, food, and shelter, and methodically repair their ship for long\u2010term aims. Therefore, their attitude during those first days would be largely unaffected by the medium of the crash landing.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
