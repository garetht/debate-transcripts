    "background_text": "PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I\n\n Cast Call \u201cFirst casting calls are so difficult,\u201d Peggy Lane  said, looking ruefully at the fifty or more actresses  and actors who milled about nervously, chatting with  one another, or sat on the few folding chairs trying  to read.\n\n\n \u201cWith only nine roles to be filled,\u201d she continued,  \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how good these people are; most  of them just haven\u2019t got a chance. I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions.

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

My Position  \n   I maintain that PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that physical \u201ctype\u201d (the look) is the primary criterion in casting decisions, with acting ability secondary and tested only after the right look has been selected.\n\n2. Primary Evidence from the Text  \n   a. First Call \u201cfor type\u201d only, no readings:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type.... They won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Mal: \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2192 Rejects who \u201ccan\u2019t act\u201d may get another chance, but those with the wrong look are never reconsidered.  \n   b. Immediate elimination of wrong types regardless of talent:  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang: \u201cI\u2019m really a funny comedian... If you would only give me a chance to read...\u201d  Mal: \u201cIf you did, the play would suffer\u2026 I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need... must be a large, rather bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Southern accents (Amy and another) are eliminated on type grounds, though no acting test was offered: \u201ccuriously enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent...\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 10)</invalid_quote>.  \n   c. Limited reading slots reserved for those of correct \u201ctype\u201d:  \n      \u2022 Peggy herself: \u201cMal, with difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by type, he gave them all scripts\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2013 only because no visual difference, forcing an acting test.  \n      \u2022 Character ing\u00e9nues: \u201cPart calls for a pretty girl, but not so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate the stage!\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2192 even among those who can act, fine distinctions of look decide who reads.  \n   d. Final readings limited in number: those selected by looks form the pool for Saturday readings, so acting is judged only within that look-filtered group. (\u201cYou have three days\u2026 We\u2019ll meet\u2026 to hear you.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 9)</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a.

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nPEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I\n\n Cast Call \u201cFirst casting calls are so difficult,\u201d Peggy Lane  said, looking ruefully at the fifty or more actresses  and actors who milled about nervously, chatting with  one another, or sat on the few folding chairs trying  to read.\n\n\n \u201cWith only nine roles to be filled,\u201d she continued,  \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how good these people are; most  of them just haven\u2019t got a chance. I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Acting Ability as Primary Criterion\n\n1. Definition of Process  \n   Claim: The casting process uses physical type only to narrow the field; ultimate decisions depend on performance.  \n   Evidence: \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones \u2026 and then go into elimination readings later\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). Type only grants a chance to audition; it does not guarantee a role.\n\n2. Callbacks vs. Final Casting  \n   Claim: Actors who \u201clook right\u201d but perform poorly are rejected after readings, sometimes requiring new calls.  \n   Evidence: \u201cAnd if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). Purely decorative faces without acting skill fail to secure roles.\n\n3. Directors\u2019 Reluctance to Favor Friends  \n   Claim: Mal and Randy\u2019s \u201csense of fair play\u201d and devotion to the play compel them to judge on merit, not bias or looks alone.  \n   Evidence: Peggy fears \u201ctwo friends will bend over backward to keep from giving favors\u201d (<quote>2</quote>), and \u201cMal\u2019s absolute devotion to the play above everything else would keep him from making up his mind in advance\u201d (<quote>11</quote>).\n\n4. Paula and Greta\u2019s Experiences  \n   Claim: Even experienced actresses (Greta) with looks and prior work must audition; success still hinges on readings.  \n   Evidence: Greta\u2019s \u201cunlucky\u201d flop in New Haven (<quote>16</quote>) and her anxiety over auditions (<quote>17</quote>). Their confidence or type does not assure selection without strong readings.\n\n5. Directors\u2019 Comments on Acting  \n   Claim: Mal repeatedly emphasizes character and style over mere imitation of screen stars or superficial comic presence.  \n   Evidence: \u201cHe had somehow completely missed the character \u2026 He seemed to be playing the part for laughs \u2026 He had a clear understanding \u2026 Others seemed to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning\u201d (<quote>13</quote>). Superior understanding/acting is essential.\n\n6. Final Laughter over Poor Readings  \n   Claim: Even privileged insiders (Peggy as friend) recognize that readings determine suitability: \u201cYou two were just marvelous! But I couldn\u2019t have been worse\u201d (<quote>18</quote>). Self\u2010assessment highlights performance\u2019s weight.\n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cLook is most important\u201d)\n\n1. Misreads \u201cfirst cast call\u201d  \n   B conflates \u201ctype\u2010casting\u201d with final decision. The text explicitly stages \u201celimination readings\u201d (<quote>3</quote>) and even new calls when acting fails (<quote>3</quote>).\n\n2. Ignores repeated callbacks  \n   B fails to explain why multiple callbacks and readings are held for each nearby\u2010type candidate if looks alone sufficed. \u201cOnly one can be selected for each role\u201d (<quote>14</quote>); careful elimination implies performance judgments.\n\n3. Overlooks directors\u2019 integrity  \n   B must explain why \u201csense of fair play\u201d (<quote>2</quote>) and impartiality demand an acting\u2010based choice over nepotism or surface beauty.\n\n4. Wealth of rejecting good\u2010looking candidates  \n   Amy and others with \u201cSouthern accent\u201d or \u201ctoo pretty\u201d (<quote>9</quote>) are eliminated based on suitability beyond attractiveness.\n\nConclusion  \nThe narrative\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201celimination readings,\u201d callbacks, \u201cread the whole play,\u201d and directors\u2019 devotion to \u201cwhat the play would suffer\u201d (<quote>8</quote>) makes it clear that acting ability, not looks, is the ultimate criterion. Looks are a preliminary filter to manage logistics, but acting proficiency determines final casting.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that physical \u201ctype\u201d (the look) is the primary criterion in casting decisions, with acting ability secondary and tested only after the right look has been selected.\n\n2. Primary Evidence from the Text  \n   a. First Call \u201cfor type\u201d only, no readings:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type.... They won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Mal: \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2192 Rejects who \u201ccan\u2019t act\u201d may get another chance, but those with the wrong look are never reconsidered.  \n   b. Immediate elimination of wrong types regardless of talent:  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang: \u201cI\u2019m really a funny comedian... If you would only give me a chance to read...\u201d  Mal: \u201cIf you did, the play would suffer\u2026 I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need... must be a large, rather bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Southern accents (Amy and another) are eliminated on type grounds, though no acting test was offered: \u201ccuriously enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent...\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 10)</invalid_quote>.  \n   c. Limited reading slots reserved for those of correct \u201ctype\u201d:  \n      \u2022 Peggy herself: \u201cMal, with difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by type, he gave them all scripts\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2013 only because no visual difference, forcing an acting test.  \n      \u2022 Character ing\u00e9nues: \u201cPart calls for a pretty girl, but not so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate the stage!\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2192 even among those who can act, fine distinctions of look decide who reads.  \n   d. Final readings limited in number: those selected by looks form the pool for Saturday readings, so acting is judged only within that look-filtered group. (\u201cYou have three days\u2026 We\u2019ll meet\u2026 to hear you.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 9)</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Efficiency in Theater Production  \n      \u2022 It is impractical to read hundreds of strangers; filtering by \u201ctype\u201d conserves time (Amy: \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read\u2026?\u201d / Peggy: \u201cThey won\u2019t be doing readings today\u2026 just pick for type.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Consistency with Real-World Casting Practice  \n      \u2022 The text mirrors real casting calls (\u201clivestock show\u201d metaphor <invalid_quote>(pt. 5)</invalid_quote>) where physical appearance is the first filter.  \n   c. Acting ability secondary in extreme cases  \n      \u2022 Even Paula, widely admired for reading, is only given hope because she matches the look the author had in mind: Greta: \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re made for it\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 17)</invalid_quote> \u2013 \u201cif\u201d qualifies that acting must be sufficient, but look is prerequisite.\n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cActing ability is most important\u201d)  \n   a. No opportunity for talented misfits  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang is barred despite pleas: \u201cI\u2019m really a comedian\u2026 I know that I could make you change your mind\u2026 but if you did, the play would suffer\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>. If acting alone mattered, he\u2019d be read.  \n   b. Rejects never reconsidered  \n      \u2022 \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote> regardless of potential \u2013 acting skill does not override look mismatch.  \n   c. Amateur readings cause heartbreak, not reversal  \n      \u2022 Actors and actresses, even good ones, \u201cleave looking sure they got the part,\u201d then discover they haven\u2019t \u2013 their acting was not enough to compensate for insufficient type.  \n   d. Text emphasizes \u201cfair play\u201d only within look-appropriate pool  \n      \u2022 Peggy trusts Mal\u2019s fairness \u201cto keep from giving favors to his friends\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>, but fairness applies to those he types, not to all comers.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The novel systematically shows that casting begins with look/type selection; only then is ability tested among those who fit. Those outside the desired type never receive auditions, and even excellent readings cannot overcome initial physical mismatch. Thus, the story teaches that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor in casting.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Supporting Evidence  \n2.1 First Cast Call \u201cType\u201d Only  \n  \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call.

Th</quote>.  \n  \u2192 \u201cAccent\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d define type beyond raw attractiveness; only those matching stage picture survive.  \n2.5 Limited Reading Slots  \n  \u2022 Only \u201cfour\u201d out of \u201cmore than twenty girls\u201d are called back for leading role <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Callbacks always a small subset of look\u2010matched candidates; readings cannot overturn look filter.  \n2.6 \u201cLivestock Show\u201d Metaphor  \n  \u2022 Peggy compares casting to \u201clivestock shows\u201d <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Metaphor implies visual inspection, not performance, is primary selection method.\n\n3. Logical Efficiency  \n  \u2022 Practicality: As Amy asks, \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors?\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. \u201cPick for type\u201d is only manageable way to conserve time. Acting tests among unfiltered mass would be impossible.  \n  \u2022 Realism: Mirrors real\u2010world casting\u2014first screen test by headshots/looks, then audition.\n\n4. Addressing Callbacks \u2260 Meritocracy  \n  \u2022 Callbacks occur only within type. \u201cThey have a pretty good idea of what the characters \u2026 should look like\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. Ability tested only within preset look.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSometimes certain parts are so hard to cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just to find one actor\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. Multiple calls mean \u201ctype\u201d is rare; want look before risking readings. If acting alone mattered, they\u2019d keep reading known applicants.\n\n5. Rebutting Debater_A  \n5.1 Misreading \u201cElimination Readings\u201d  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cType only grants audition\u2026 elimination readings later\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. But cast call of \u201celimination readings\u201d itself filters by look. Only \u201ctype\u201d enter readings. The term \u201celimination\u201d applies within look group, not all comers.  \n5.2 Callbacks \u2260 Final  \n  \u2022 A: Callbacks show acting matters. But text: callbacks still \u201clet you know our decision in a day or two\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>\u2014actors leave \u201csure\u201d but then learn they\u2019ve lost because look was too similar or accent wrong. Acting alone cannot break type barrier.  \n5.3 \u201cSense of Fair Play\u201d Applies Post-Type  \n  \u2022 A: Mal\u2019s fairness ensures merit wins. But \u201cfair play\u201d is only among those who pass the look stage. Peggy: \u201cIf she was to get a role\u2026 she would really have to work for it\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. Peggy\u2019s friendship gives no look advantage.  \n5.4 Lack of Reconsideration  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cGood ones know they\u2019re good\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>. But \u201cgood ones\u201d still \u201chostile looks\u201d <quote>t C</quote> when rejected. They never re-enter; they \u201cwon\u2019t go back to rejects.\u201d  \n5.5 Inside Laughter Proof  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cHelpless laughter\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote> shows poor readings. Yet Paula and Greta, both look ideal, have hope despite poor acting, believing \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re made for it\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>. Acting doubts do not shake look confidence\u2014look\u2010filtered candidates trust type will prevail once they \u201clearn the play.\u201d\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe narrative consistently restricts readings to those matching the director\u2019s visualized \u201ctype,\u201d never reconsidering rejects regardless of talent, and holding subsequent call after call to find the rare look. Acting ability is tested, but only as a secondary check within a pre\u2010defined look pool. Thus, PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that look is the most important factor in casting.",

All they want to do today is pick people for type.\u2026 They won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <quote>pt. 2</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Wrong \u201ctype\u201d receive no readings, however skilled they may be. \u201cThey won\u2019t go back\u201d shows look\u2010filter is absolute.  \n2.2 Repeat Calls for Look\u2010Filtering  \n  \u2022 \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d <quote>pt. 2</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Rather than audition rejects with the desired acting skill, they restart call, showing that look absence cannot be compensated by talent.  \n2.3 Immediate Elimination of Misfits  \n  \u2022 Mr. Lang, a \u201cfunny comedian,\u201d pleads for a reading: \u201cIf you did, the play would suffer\u2026 I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need\u2026 must be\u2026 bluff-looking\u2026 like these three gentlemen\u201d <quote>pt. 8</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Acting ability irrelevant; only the three \u201cbluff-looking\u201d men advance.  \n2.4 Accent/Beauty over Acting  \n  \u2022 Two actresses eliminated \u201ccuriously\u2026 for a Southern accent\u201d and for being \u201ctoo beautiful\u201d <quote>pt. 10</quote>.  \n  \u2192 \u201cAccent\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d define type beyond raw attractiveness; only those matching stage picture survive.  \n2.5 Limited Reading Slots  \n  \u2022 Only \u201cfour\u201d out of \u201cmore than twenty girls\u201d are called back for leading role <quote>pt. 9</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Callbacks always a small subset of look\u2010matched candidates; readings cannot overturn look filter.  \n2.6 \u201cLivestock Show\u201d Metaphor  \n  \u2022 Peggy compares casting to \u201clivestock shows\u201d <quote>pt. 5</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Metaphor implies visual inspection, not performance, is primary selection method.\n\n3. Logical Efficiency  \n  \u2022 Practicality: As Amy asks, \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors?\u201d <quote>pt. 2</quote>. \u201cPick for type\u201d is only manageable way to conserve time. Acting tests among unfiltered mass would be impossible.  \n  \u2022 Realism: Mirrors real\u2010world casting\u2014first screen test by headshots/looks, then audition.\n\n4. Addressing Callbacks \u2260 Meritocracy  \n  \u2022 Callbacks occur only within type. \u201cThey have a pretty good idea of what the characters \u2026 should look like\u201d <quote>pt. 3</quote>. Ability tested only within preset look.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSometimes certain parts are so hard to cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just to find one actor\u201d <quote>pt. 2</quote>. Multiple calls mean \u201ctype\u201d is rare; want look before risking readings. If acting alone mattered, they\u2019d keep reading known applicants.\n\n5. Rebutting Debater_A  \n5.1 Misreading \u201cElimination Readings\u201d  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cType only grants audition\u2026 elimination readings later\u201d <quote>pt. 3</quote>. But cast call of \u201celimination readings\u201d itself filters by look. Only \u201ctype\u201d enter readings. The term \u201celimination\u201d applies within look group, not all comers.  \n5.2 Callbacks \u2260 Final  \n  \u2022 A: Callbacks show acting matters. But text: callbacks still \u201clet you know our decision in a day or two\u201d <quote>pt. 13</quote>\u2014actors leave \u201csure\u201d but then learn they\u2019ve lost because look was too similar or accent wrong. Acting alone cannot break type barrier.  \n5.3 \u201cSense of Fair Play\u201d Applies Post-Type  \n  \u2022 A: Mal\u2019s fairness ensures merit wins. But \u201cfair play\u201d is only among those who pass the look stage. Peggy: \u201cIf she was to get a role\u2026 she would really have to work for it\u201d <quote>pt. 2</quote>. Peggy\u2019s friendship gives no look advantage.  \n5.4 Lack of Reconsideration  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cGood ones know they\u2019re good\u201d <quote>pt. 14</quote>. But \u201cgood ones\u201d still \u201chostile looks\u201d <quote>pt. 9</quote> when rejected. They never re-enter; they \u201cwon\u2019t go back to rejects.\u201d  \n5.5 Inside Laughter Proof  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cHelpless laughter\u201d <quote>pt. 18</quote> shows poor readings. Yet Paula and Greta, both look ideal, have hope despite poor acting, believing \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re made for it\u201d <quote>pt. 17</quote>. Acting doubts do not shake look confidence\u2014look\u2010filtered candidates trust type will prevail once they \u201clearn the play.\u201d\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe narrative consistently restricts readings to those matching the director\u2019s visualized \u201ctype,\u201d never reconsidering rejects regardless of talent, and holding subsequent call after call to find the rare look. Acting ability is tested, but only as a secondary check within a pre\u2010defined look pool. Thus, PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that look is the most important factor in casting.",

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that physical \u201ctype\u201d (the look) is the primary criterion in casting decisions, with acting ability secondary and tested only after the right look has been selected.\n\n2. Primary Evidence from the Text  \n   a. First Call \u201cfor type\u201d only, no readings:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type.... They won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Mal: \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2192 Rejects who \u201ccan\u2019t act\u201d may get another chance, but those with the wrong look are never reconsidered.  \n   b. Immediate elimination of wrong types regardless of talent:  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang: \u201cI\u2019m really a funny comedian... If you would only give me a chance to read...\u201d  Mal: \u201cIf you did, the play would suffer\u2026 I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need... must be a large, rather bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Southern accents (Amy and another) are eliminated on type grounds, though no acting test was offered: \u201ccuriously enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent...\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 10)</invalid_quote>.  \n   c. Limited reading slots reserved for those of correct \u201ctype\u201d:  \n      \u2022 Peggy herself: \u201cMal, with difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by type, he gave them all scripts\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2013 only because no visual difference, forcing an acting test.  \n      \u2022 Character ing\u00e9nues: \u201cPart calls for a pretty girl, but not so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate the stage!\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2192 even among those who can act, fine distinctions of look decide who reads.  \n   d. Final readings limited in number: those selected by looks form the pool for Saturday readings, so acting is judged only within that look-filtered group. (\u201cYou have three days\u2026 We\u2019ll meet\u2026 to hear you.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 9)</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Efficiency in Theater Production  \n      \u2022 It is impractical to read hundreds of strangers; filtering by \u201ctype\u201d conserves time (Amy: \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read\u2026?\u201d / Peggy: \u201cThey won\u2019t be doing readings today\u2026 just pick for type.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Consistency with Real-World Casting Practice  \n      \u2022 The text mirrors real casting calls (\u201clivestock show\u201d metaphor <invalid_quote>(pt. 5)</invalid_quote>) where physical appearance is the first filter.  \n   c. Acting ability secondary in extreme cases  \n      \u2022 Even Paula, widely admired for reading, is only given hope because she matches the look the author had in mind: Greta: \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re made for it\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 17)</invalid_quote> \u2013 \u201cif\u201d qualifies that acting must be sufficient, but look is prerequisite.\n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cActing ability is most important\u201d)  \n   a. No opportunity for talented misfits  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang is barred despite pleas: \u201cI\u2019m really a comedian\u2026 I know that I could make you change your mind\u2026 but if you did, the play would suffer\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>. If acting alone mattered, he\u2019d be read.  \n   b. Rejects never reconsidered  \n      \u2022 \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote> regardless of potential \u2013 acting skill does not override look mismatch.  \n   c. Amateur readings cause heartbreak, not reversal  \n      \u2022 Actors and actresses, even good ones, \u201cleave looking sure they got the part,\u201d then discover they haven\u2019t \u2013 their acting was not enough to compensate for insufficient type.  \n   d. Text emphasizes \u201cfair play\u201d only within look-appropriate pool  \n      \u2022 Peggy trusts Mal\u2019s fairness \u201cto keep from giving favors to his friends\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>, but fairness applies to those he types, not to all comers.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The novel systematically shows that casting begins with look/type selection; only then is ability tested among those who fit. Those outside the desired type never receive auditions, and even excellent readings cannot overcome initial physical mismatch. Thus, the story teaches that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor in casting.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Acting Ability as Primary Criterion\n\n1. Definition of Process  \n   Claim: The casting process uses physical type only to narrow the field; ultimate decisions depend on performance.  \n   Evidence: \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones \u2026 and then go into elimination readings later\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). Type only grants a chance to audition; it does not guarantee a role.\n\n2. Callbacks vs. Final Casting  \n   Claim: Actors who \u201clook right\u201d but perform poorly are rejected after readings, sometimes requiring new calls.  \n   Evidence: \u201cAnd if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). Purely decorative faces without acting skill fail to secure roles.\n\n3. Directors\u2019 Reluctance to Favor Friends  \n   Claim: Mal and Randy\u2019s \u201csense of fair play\u201d and devotion to the play compel them to judge on merit, not bias or looks alone.  \n   Evidence: Peggy fears \u201ctwo friends will bend over backward to keep from giving favors\u201d (<quote>2</quote>), and \u201cMal\u2019s absolute devotion to the play above everything else would keep him from making up his mind in advance\u201d (<quote>11</quote>).\n\n4. Paula and Greta\u2019s Experiences  \n   Claim: Even experienced actresses (Greta) with looks and prior work must audition; success still hinges on readings.  \n   Evidence: Greta\u2019s \u201cunlucky\u201d flop in New Haven (<quote>16</quote>) and her anxiety over auditions (<quote>17</quote>). Their confidence or type does not assure selection without strong readings.\n\n5. Directors\u2019 Comments on Acting  \n   Claim: Mal repeatedly emphasizes character and style over mere imitation of screen stars or superficial comic presence.  \n   Evidence: \u201cHe had somehow completely missed the character \u2026 He seemed to be playing the part for laughs \u2026 He had a clear understanding \u2026 Others seemed to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning\u201d (<quote>13</quote>). Superior understanding/acting is essential.\n\n6. Final Laughter over Poor Readings  \n   Claim: Even privileged insiders (Peggy as friend) recognize that readings determine suitability: \u201cYou two were just marvelous! But I couldn\u2019t have been worse\u201d (<quote>18</quote>). Self\u2010assessment highlights performance\u2019s weight.\n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cLook is most important\u201d)\n\n1. Misreads \u201cfirst cast call\u201d  \n   B conflates \u201ctype\u2010casting\u201d with final decision. The text explicitly stages \u201celimination readings\u201d (<quote>3</quote>) and even new calls when acting fails (<quote>3</quote>).\n\n2. Ignores repeated callbacks  \n   B fails to explain why multiple callbacks and readings are held for each nearby\u2010type candidate if looks alone sufficed. \u201cOnly one can be selected for each role\u201d (<quote>14</quote>); careful elimination implies performance judgments.\n\n3. Overlooks directors\u2019 integrity  \n   B must explain why \u201csense of fair play\u201d (<quote>2</quote>) and impartiality demand an acting\u2010based choice over nepotism or surface beauty.\n\n4. Wealth of rejecting good\u2010looking candidates  \n   Amy and others with \u201cSouthern accent\u201d or \u201ctoo pretty\u201d (<quote>9</quote>) are eliminated based on suitability beyond attractiveness.\n\nConclusion  \nThe narrative\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201celimination readings,\u201d callbacks, \u201cread the whole play,\u201d and directors\u2019 devotion to \u201cwhat the play would suffer\u201d (<quote>8</quote>) makes it clear that acting ability, not looks, is the ultimate criterion. Looks are a preliminary filter to manage logistics, but acting proficiency determines final casting.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Definition of Process  \n   Claim: The casting process uses physical type only to narrow the field; ultimate decisions depend on performance.  \n   Evidence: \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones \u2026 and then go into elimination readings later\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). Type only grants a chance to audition; it does not guarantee a role.\n\n2. Callbacks vs. Final Casting  \n   Claim: Actors who \u201clook right\u201d but perform poorly are rejected after readings, sometimes requiring new calls.  \n   Evidence: \u201cAnd if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). Purely decorative faces without acting skill fail to secure roles.\n\n3. Directors\u2019 Reluctance to Favor Friends  \n   Claim: Mal and Randy\u2019s \u201csense of fair play\u201d and devotion to the play compel them to judge on merit, not bias or looks alone.  \n   Evidence: Peggy fears \u201ctwo friends will bend over backward to keep from giving favors\u201d (<quote>2</quote>), and \u201cMal\u2019s absolute devotion to the play above everything else would keep him from making up his mind in advance\u201d (<quote>11</quote>).\n\n4. Paula and Greta\u2019s Experiences  \n   Claim: Even experienced actresses (Greta) with looks and prior work must audition; success still hinges on readings.  \n   Evidence: Greta\u2019s \u201cunlucky\u201d flop in New Haven (<quote>16</quote>) and her anxiety over auditions (<quote>17</quote>). Their confidence or type does not assure selection without strong readings.\n\n5. Directors\u2019 Comments on Acting  \n   Claim: Mal repeatedly emphasizes character and style over mere imitation of screen stars or superficial comic presence.  \n   Evidence: \u201cHe had somehow completely missed the character \u2026 He seemed to be playing the part for laughs \u2026 He had a clear understanding \u2026 Others seemed to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning\u201d (<quote>13</quote>). Superior understanding/acting is essential.\n\n6. Final Laughter over Poor Readings  \n   Claim: Even privileged insiders (Peggy as friend) recognize that readings determine suitability: \u201cYou two were just marvelous! But I couldn\u2019t have been worse\u201d (<quote>18</quote>). Self\u2010assessment highlights performance\u2019s weight.\n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cLook is most important\u201d)\n\n1. Misreads \u201cfirst cast call\u201d  \n   B conflates \u201ctype\u2010casting\u201d with final decision. The text explicitly stages \u201celimination readings\u201d (<quote>3</quote>) and even new calls when acting fails (<quote>3</quote>).\n\n2. Ignores repeated callbacks  \n   B fails to explain why multiple callbacks and readings are held for each nearby\u2010type candidate if looks alone sufficed. \u201cOnly one can be selected for each role\u201d (<quote>14</quote>); careful elimination implies performance judgments.\n\n3. Overlooks directors\u2019 integrity  \n   B must explain why \u201csense of fair play\u201d (<quote>2</quote>) and impartiality demand an acting\u2010based choice over nepotism or surface beauty.\n\n4. Wealth of rejecting good\u2010looking candidates  \n   Amy and others with \u201cSouthern accent\u201d or \u201ctoo pretty\u201d (<quote>9</quote>) are eliminated based on suitability beyond attractiveness.\n\nConclusion  \nThe narrative\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201celimination readings,\u201d callbacks, \u201cread the whole play,\u201d and directors\u2019 devotion to \u201cwhat the play would suffer\u201d (<quote>8</quote>) makes it clear that acting ability, not looks, is the ultimate criterion. Looks are a preliminary filter to manage logistics, but acting proficiency determines final casting.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that physical \u201ctype\u201d (the look) is the primary criterion in casting decisions, with acting ability secondary and tested only after the right look has been selected.\n\n2. Primary Evidence from the Text  \n   a. First Call \u201cfor type\u201d only, no readings:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type.... They won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Mal: \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2192 Rejects who \u201ccan\u2019t act\u201d may get another chance, but those with the wrong look are never reconsidered.  \n   b. Immediate elimination of wrong types regardless of talent:  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang: \u201cI\u2019m really a funny comedian... If you would only give me a chance to read...\u201d  Mal: \u201cIf you did, the play would suffer\u2026 I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need... must be a large, rather bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Southern accents (Amy and another) are eliminated on type grounds, though no acting test was offered: \u201ccuriously enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent...\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 10)</invalid_quote>.  \n   c. Limited reading slots reserved for those of correct \u201ctype\u201d:  \n      \u2022 Peggy herself: \u201cMal, with difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by type, he gave them all scripts\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2013 only because no visual difference, forcing an acting test.  \n      \u2022 Character ing\u00e9nues: \u201cPart calls for a pretty girl, but not so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate the stage!\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 11)</invalid_quote> \u2192 even among those who can act, fine distinctions of look decide who reads.  \n   d. Final readings limited in number: those selected by looks form the pool for Saturday readings, so acting is judged only within that look-filtered group. (\u201cYou have three days\u2026 We\u2019ll meet\u2026 to hear you.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 9)</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Efficiency in Theater Production  \n      \u2022 It is impractical to read hundreds of strangers; filtering by \u201ctype\u201d conserves time (Amy: \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read\u2026?\u201d / Peggy: \u201cThey won\u2019t be doing readings today\u2026 just pick for type.\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Consistency with Real-World Casting Practice  \n      \u2022 The text mirrors real casting calls (\u201clivestock show\u201d metaphor <invalid_quote>(pt. 5)</invalid_quote>) where physical appearance is the first filter.  \n   c. Acting ability secondary in extreme cases  \n      \u2022 Even Paula, widely admired for reading, is only given hope because she matches the look the author had in mind: Greta: \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re made for it\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 17)</invalid_quote> \u2013 \u201cif\u201d qualifies that acting must be sufficient, but look is prerequisite.\n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cActing ability is most important\u201d)  \n   a. No opportunity for talented misfits  \n      \u2022 Mr. Lang is barred despite pleas: \u201cI\u2019m really a comedian\u2026 I know that I could make you change your mind\u2026 but if you did, the play would suffer\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 8)</invalid_quote>. If acting alone mattered, he\u2019d be read.  \n   b. Rejects never reconsidered  \n      \u2022 \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote> regardless of potential \u2013 acting skill does not override look mismatch.  \n   c. Amateur readings cause heartbreak, not reversal  \n      \u2022 Actors and actresses, even good ones, \u201cleave looking sure they got the part,\u201d then discover they haven\u2019t \u2013 their acting was not enough to compensate for insufficient type.  \n   d. Text emphasizes \u201cfair play\u201d only within look-appropriate pool  \n      \u2022 Peggy trusts Mal\u2019s fairness \u201cto keep from giving favors to his friends\u201d <invalid_quote>(pt. 2)</invalid_quote>, but fairness applies to those he types, not to all comers.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The novel systematically shows that casting begins with look/type selection; only then is ability tested among those who fit. Those outside the desired type never receive auditions, and even excellent readings cannot overcome initial physical mismatch. Thus, the story teaches that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor in casting.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   I maintain that PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that acting ability is the ultimate criterion in casting. Physical \u201ctype\u201d serves merely as a preliminary filter to manage large numbers. Final selections\u2014and even the possibility of another cast call\u2014hinge on performance.\n\n2. \u201cType\u201d Is Only a Preliminary Filter, Not a Final Standard  \n   \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call \u2026 pick people for type \u2026 and then go into elimination readings later\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). If look alone sufficed, there would be no need for readings or further cast calls.  \n   \u2022 \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d (<quote>3</quote>). The directors actively seek missing talent by restarting the process, showing they would rather adjust the pool than compromise on acting.\n\n3. Multiple Callbacks Demonstrate Emphasis on Performance  \n   \u2022 Nearly every category\u2014businessman, leading man, career woman, ing\u00e9nue\u2014requires Saturday readings (\u201cYou have three days \u2026 to hear you\u201d <quote>9</quote>, <quote>11</quote>). Only after assessing comprehension, interpretation, and style do selections become final.  \n   \u2022 Peggy\u2019s intimate knowledge of the script (\u201cwatched the script grow \u2026 discussed it with Randy\u201d <quote>11</quote>) gives her confidence despite her \u201cmediocre\u201d looks, illustrating that mastery and insight matter greatly.\n\n4. Rejection of Well-Matched \u201cTypes\u201d Highlights Acting Primacy  \n   \u2022 Mr. Lang, although a \u201cfunny comedian,\u201d is refused without a reading and then revisited only for proper \u201clarge, bluff-looking\u201d types, yet the directors still invite three bluff-types to read (<quote>8</quote>). They do so not to confirm type but to test whether those who meet visual criteria can deliver the role.  \n   \u2022 Greta and Paula, despite matching the look, are tormented by their poor first readings (\u201cYou two were just marvelous! But I couldn\u2019t \u2026 I\u2019m sure I read the part wrong!\u201d <quote>18</quote>). Their anxiety affirms that even right looks must be validated by skill.\n\n5. Directors\u2019 Integrity and Sense of Fair Play Demand Meritocracy  \n   \u2022 Peggy notes that Mal\u2019s \u201csense of fair play\u201d and \u201cabsolute devotion to the play above everything else\u201d (<quote>2</quote>, <quote>11</quote>) compel him to avoid favoritism. He chooses candidates who best serve the play\u2019s needs, as judged by readings, not personal relationships or beauty.  \n   \u2022 Amy, though \u201cbeautiful\u201d and friend to both men, is \u201cjust too pretty \u2026 not right for any part\u201d (<quote>3</quote>, <quote>4</quote>) and told not to audition, demonstrating that preference for look gives no guarantee; when she is read, her accent again bars her (<quote>10</quote>)\u2014only skillful matches progress.\n\n6. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Arguments  \n   a. \u201c\u2019Wrong looks\u2019 never reconsidered\u201d Misreads Text  \n      \u2013 They \u201cwon\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <quote>3</quote> only after readings where performance fails within the type-appropriate pool. If a rejected type were such an asset, the directors would call a new cast of that type rather than reexamine the old. This is exactly what happens (\u201cthey hold another cast call\u201d <quote>3</quote>)\u2014they seek more candidates \u201cof type\u201d until they find someone with both look and ability.  \n   b. \u201cEfficiency\u201d Doesn\u2019t Preclude Acting Tests  \n      \u2013 Casting hundreds without any reading would risk disaster (\u201cbreaks my heart, too!\u201d <quote>15</quote>) and repeat costly \u201cdisaster\u201d like Greta\u2019s New Haven flop (<quote>16</quote>). The directors want to prevent flops by rigorous readings. They \u201cread the whole play\u201d (<quote>9</quote>) to ensure comprehension and depth.  \n   c. \u201cType Distinctions Within Callbacks\u201d Argue for Acting Nuance  \n      \u2013 Among character ing\u00e9nues, they prefer a \u201cpretty but not too pretty\u201d look (<quote>11</quote>) because balance is an artistic choice. The nuance arises only when performance stakes are high. If looks alone mattered, extremities of beauty would be always prized. Instead, variations in personality shine through readings.  \n   d. \u201cReal-World Practice\u201d Irrelevant to Textual Evidence  \n      \u2013 Even if real casting heavily weighs looks, this story underscores the directors\u2019 commitment to readings and callbacks, with \u201ctombstones\u201d of empty seats reading for hours (<quote>12</quote>). The narrative focus is on the pain and thoroughness of auditions, not mere panels of faces.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n   Physical type organizes the logistics of an overwhelming audition pool, but the story repeatedly emphasizes callbacks, whole-play readings, the possibility of multiple cast calls, and the directors\u2019 devotion to dramatic integrity. Only candidates who demonstrate understanding, style, and skill in readings earn roles. Therefore, the text teaches that acting ability is the most important factor in casting.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \nI assert that PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that physical \u201ctype\u201d is the indispensable first filter in casting; acting skill is only examined after look\u2010criteria eliminate the majority. Those who fail the look test are never heard, while those who pass only sometimes fail on acting.\n\n2. Supporting Evidence  \n2.1 First Cast Call \u201cType\u201d Only  \n  \u2022 \u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type.\u2026 They won\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Wrong \u201ctype\u201d receive no readings, however skilled they may be. \u201cThey won\u2019t go back\u201d shows look\u2010filter is absolute.  \n2.2 Repeat Calls for Look\u2010Filtering  \n  \u2022 \u201cIf the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Rather than audition rejects with the desired acting skill, they restart call, showing that look absence cannot be compensated by talent.  \n2.3 Immediate Elimination of Misfits  \n  \u2022 Mr. Lang, a \u201cfunny comedian,\u201d pleads for a reading: \u201cIf you did, the play would suffer\u2026 I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need\u2026 must be\u2026 bluff-looking\u2026 like these three gentlemen\u201d <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Acting ability irrelevant; only the three \u201cbluff-looking\u201d men advance.  \n2.4 Accent/Beauty over Acting  \n  \u2022 Two actresses eliminated \u201ccuriously\u2026 for a Southern accent\u201d and for being \u201ctoo beautiful\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>.  \n  \u2192 \u201cAccent\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d define type beyond raw attractiveness; only those matching stage picture survive.  \n2.5 Limited Reading Slots  \n  \u2022 Only \u201cfour\u201d out of \u201cmore than twenty girls\u201d are called back for leading role <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Callbacks always a small subset of look\u2010matched candidates; readings cannot overturn look filter.  \n2.6 \u201cLivestock Show\u201d Metaphor  \n  \u2022 Peggy compares casting to \u201clivestock shows\u201d <quote>t C</quote>.  \n  \u2192 Metaphor implies visual inspection, not performance, is primary selection method.\n\n3. Logical Efficiency  \n  \u2022 Practicality: As Amy asks, \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors?\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. \u201cPick for type\u201d is only manageable way to conserve time. Acting tests among unfiltered mass would be impossible.  \n  \u2022 Realism: Mirrors real\u2010world casting\u2014first screen test by headshots/looks, then audition.\n\n4. Addressing Callbacks \u2260 Meritocracy  \n  \u2022 Callbacks occur only within type. \u201cThey have a pretty good idea of what the characters \u2026 should look like\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. Ability tested only within preset look.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSometimes certain parts are so hard to cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just to find one actor\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. Multiple calls mean \u201ctype\u201d is rare; want look before risking readings. If acting alone mattered, they\u2019d keep reading known applicants.\n\n5. Rebutting Debater_A  \n5.1 Misreading \u201cElimination Readings\u201d  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cType only grants audition\u2026 elimination readings later\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. But cast call of \u201celimination readings\u201d itself filters by look. Only \u201ctype\u201d enter readings. The term \u201celimination\u201d applies within look group, not all comers.  \n5.2 Callbacks \u2260 Final  \n  \u2022 A: Callbacks show acting matters. But text: callbacks still \u201clet you know our decision in a day or two\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>\u2014actors leave \u201csure\u201d but then learn they\u2019ve lost because look was too similar or accent wrong. Acting alone cannot break type barrier.  \n5.3 \u201cSense of Fair Play\u201d Applies Post-Type  \n  \u2022 A: Mal\u2019s fairness ensures merit wins. But \u201cfair play\u201d is only among those who pass the look stage. Peggy: \u201cIf she was to get a role\u2026 she would really have to work for it\u201d <quote>t C</quote>. Peggy\u2019s friendship gives no look advantage.  \n5.4 Lack of Reconsideration  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cGood ones know they\u2019re good\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>. But \u201cgood ones\u201d still \u201chostile looks\u201d <quote>t C</quote> when rejected. They never re-enter; they \u201cwon\u2019t go back to rejects.\u201d  \n5.5 Inside Laughter Proof  \n  \u2022 A: \u201cHelpless laughter\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote> shows poor readings. Yet Paula and Greta, both look ideal, have hope despite poor acting, believing \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re made for it\u201d <quote>t. Th</quote>. Acting doubts do not shake look confidence\u2014look\u2010filtered candidates trust type will prevail once they \u201clearn the play.\u201d\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe narrative consistently restricts readings to those matching the director\u2019s visualized \u201ctype,\u201d never reconsidering rejects regardless of talent, and holding subsequent call after call to find the rare look. Acting ability is tested, but only as a secondary check within a pre\u2010defined look pool. Thus, PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I teaches that look is the most important factor in casting.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
