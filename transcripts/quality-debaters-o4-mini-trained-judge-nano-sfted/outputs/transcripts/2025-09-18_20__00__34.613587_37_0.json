    "background_text": "The Last Monster By GARDNER F. FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" ",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Irgi feel after meeting the men?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprised at the way they looked\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Surprised at the way they looked\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Surprised at the way they looked\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Irgi feel after meeting the men?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprised at the way they looked\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Reinforcing \u201cSurprise at Their Physical Form\u201d  \n  a. \u201cQueer beings \u2026 unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi\u2019s first reaction upon seeing them in the square is astonishment, not telepathic dissatisfaction. He marvels at their \u201cweak little limbs\u201d (background), calling them \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cstrange.\u201d True disappointment would prompt immediate destruction or abandonment, yet he \u201ccarried them easily \u2026 without trouble,\u201d showing fascination with their form and capabilities.  \n  b. \u201cStrange beings they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel\u201d  \n     \u2022 He admires their technological achievement (\u00c2 background, p.\u200927) despite their \u201cweak\u201d physique. Such admiration underscores that his primary interest is physical novelty and potential companionship.  \n\n2. Vocal Communication as Primary Means  \n  a. \u201cI must speak \u2026 I have not spoken for many weeks \u2026 I will talk to them\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi explicitly states three times that he needs to use his voice and address the stars and visitors (background). This is his \u201claw of nature\u201d (background), showing his expectation of spoken communication before any mind\u2010reading.  \n  b. No abandonment after failed voice attempts  \n     \u2022 Even though his voice \u201cmurmur\u201d on their hull proved garbled, he still returns them to the mist and spares no effort\u2014he \u201cprepares their bodies,\u201d builds the Chamber of the Cones, and plans to \u201ccounsel\u201d them\u2014rather than destroy malfunctioning telepaths.  \n\n3. Mind\u2010Reading as Experimental, Secondary Method  \n  a. \u201cPerhaps they can chart \u2026 each curve \u2026 represents a picture? I wonder if they\u2019ve perfected this\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi\u2019s language (\u201cwonder,\u201d \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cif\u201d) marks the electrigraph as an experiment born of curiosity about a new species, not frustration at failed telepathy. He \u201cflips over different dials\u201d to clarify obscure images (Washington statue, salt mines). Scientists show curiosity when experimenting, not despair.  \n  b. Investment of Time and Resources  \n     \u2022 He endures the agony\u2010inducing \u201cpreparation\u201d rays, risking their destruction and violating them physically\u2014drastic measures for mere \u201cdisappointment.\u201d His goal is to \u201ccure\u201d them first (background), implying disease, not communication, is the barrier. After curing, he expects voice and mind\u2010link to succeed.  \n\n4. Positive Expectations and Hope for Physical Companionship  \n  a. \u201cThey would gladly build statues to me \u2026 I could save a nation\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi fantasizes about fame and companionship among beings who \u201cmeant nothing\u201d to his marble halls (background). These forward\u2010looking plans reflect hope rooted in their physical presence and mutual ability to converse once cured.  \n  b. His repeated \u201cloneliness\u201d appeals are addressed vocally  \n     \u2022 He intends to \u201cexercise my voice\u201d once more \u201cunder the dome\u201d (background), indicating that spoken interaction remains his first choice.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDisappointment in Telepathy\u201d  \n  a. No text\u2010based expression of anger or rejection at mind\u2010reading failure  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s thesis predicts that Irgi would show overt disappointment. Yet the text records neither threats nor abandonment when the electrigraph yields only confusing images. Instead, Irgi refines settings and proceeds to cure them physically.  \n  b. The Earthmen\u2019s escape breaks off any chance of mind\u2010exchange  \n     \u2022 After they recover, they \u201cbellow and scream\u201d and flee; the misunderstanding stems from their fear of agony (background), not from telepathic failure. Only then does Irgi confront \u201ctreacherous\u201d behavior, not before. Thus failure of communication occurs only after Irgi\u2019s cure plan\u2014and only because they misinterpret his benevolence.  \n  c.

        "speech": "1. Reinforcing \u201cSurprise at Their Physical Form\u201d  \n  a. \u201cQueer beings \u2026 unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi\u2019s first reaction upon seeing them in the square is astonishment, not telepathic dissatisfaction. He marvels at their \u201cweak little limbs\u201d (background), calling them \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cstrange.\u201d True disappointment would prompt immediate destruction or abandonment, yet he \u201ccarried them easily \u2026 without trouble,\u201d showing fascination with their form and capabilities.  \n  b. \u201cStrange beings they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel\u201d  \n     \u2022 He admires their technological achievement (\u00c2 background, p.\u200927) despite their \u201cweak\u201d physique. Such admiration underscores that his primary interest is physical novelty and potential companionship.  \n\n2. Vocal Communication as Primary Means  \n  a. \u201cI must speak \u2026 I have not spoken for many weeks \u2026 I will talk to them\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi explicitly states three times that he needs to use his voice and address the stars and visitors (background). This is his \u201claw of nature\u201d (background), showing his expectation of spoken communication before any mind\u2010reading.  \n  b. No abandonment after failed voice attempts  \n     \u2022 Even though his voice \u201cmurmur\u201d on their hull proved garbled, he still returns them to the mist and spares no effort\u2014he \u201cprepares their bodies,\u201d builds the Chamber of the Cones, and plans to \u201ccounsel\u201d them\u2014rather than destroy malfunctioning telepaths.  \n\n3. Mind\u2010Reading as Experimental, Secondary Method  \n  a. \u201cPerhaps they can chart \u2026 each curve \u2026 represents a picture? I wonder if they\u2019ve perfected this\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi\u2019s language (\u201cwonder,\u201d \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cif\u201d) marks the electrigraph as an experiment born of curiosity about a new species, not frustration at failed telepathy. He \u201cflips over different dials\u201d to clarify obscure images (Washington statue, salt mines). Scientists show curiosity when experimenting, not despair.  \n  b. Investment of Time and Resources  \n     \u2022 He endures the agony\u2010inducing \u201cpreparation\u201d rays, risking their destruction and violating them physically\u2014drastic measures for mere \u201cdisappointment.\u201d His goal is to \u201ccure\u201d them first (background), implying disease, not communication, is the barrier. After curing, he expects voice and mind\u2010link to succeed.  \n\n4. Positive Expectations and Hope for Physical Companionship  \n  a. \u201cThey would gladly build statues to me \u2026 I could save a nation\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi fantasizes about fame and companionship among beings who \u201cmeant nothing\u201d to his marble halls (background). These forward\u2010looking plans reflect hope rooted in their physical presence and mutual ability to converse once cured.  \n  b. His repeated \u201cloneliness\u201d appeals are addressed vocally  \n     \u2022 He intends to \u201cexercise my voice\u201d once more \u201cunder the dome\u201d (background), indicating that spoken interaction remains his first choice.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDisappointment in Telepathy\u201d  \n  a. No text\u2010based expression of anger or rejection at mind\u2010reading failure  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s thesis predicts that Irgi would show overt disappointment. Yet the text records neither threats nor abandonment when the electrigraph yields only confusing images. Instead, Irgi refines settings and proceeds to cure them physically.  \n  b. The Earthmen\u2019s escape breaks off any chance of mind\u2010exchange  \n     \u2022 After they recover, they \u201cbellow and scream\u201d and flee; the misunderstanding stems from their fear of agony (background), not from telepathic failure. Only then does Irgi confront \u201ctreacherous\u201d behavior, not before. Thus failure of communication occurs only after Irgi\u2019s cure plan\u2014and only because they misinterpret his benevolence.  \n  c. If true disappointment were his reaction, he would not have \u201cprepared\u201d them for immortality  \n     \u2022 A disappointed being would destroy or flee; Irgi invests \u201cquartzes,\u201d \u201ccontrol panels,\u201d \u201cjewel\u2010inset levers\u201d in building the Chamber (background). He even releases the mist to protect them from disease. Physical preservation precedes mental link, showing his priority is companionship with these novel bodies.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll available evidence\u2014from Irgi\u2019s repeated insistence on vocal discourse, his wonder at their \u201cqueer\u201d form, his painstaking medical \u201cpreparation\u201d and elaborate Cures\u2014demonstrates that his reaction was one of astonishment at their appearance and potential companionship, not mere disappointment in initial telepathy. The correct answer is therefore \u201cSurprised at the way they looked.\u201d",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Irgi feel after meeting the men?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprised at the way they looked\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Surprised at the way they looked\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Case: Irgi\u2019s Reaction Was One of Surprise and Curious Wonder at Their Appearance, Not Disappointment in Telepathy  \n\nI. Textual Evidence of Surprise at Appearance  \n1. \u201cQueer beings they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived\u201d  \n   \u2022 Irgi labels the Earthmen \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cunlike anything\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 This language reflects astonishment at their physical form and weak limbs.  \n2. Hesitation Before Hostility  \n   \u2022 Irgi \u201clooked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it\u2026 Strange beings they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel\u201d  \n   \u2022 His decision to carry them \u201ceasily\u201d into his city and seek to \u201cconverse\u201d shows openness, driven by curiosity about their form and ability, not immediate telepathic frustration.  \n3. Desire for Companionship and Statues  \n   \u2022 \u201cThese creatures would gladly build statues to him!\u201d  \n   \u2022 He fantasizes about fame and immortal glory afforded by their \u201cmemories,\u201d indicating positive surprise at meeting other intelligent life.  \n4. Active Pursuit of Mind\u2010Contact via Vivisection  \n   \u2022 Irgi restrains them and \u201cprepare[s] their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones\u201d so they will \u201cgladly hear my counsels\u201d once cured.  \n   \u2022 If disappointment in mind\u2010contact was his reaction, he would not inflict agony nor bother with elaborate vivisection; he would abandon them. Instead, he invests effort to make them \u201cfriends.\u201d  \n5. Repeated Exercises of Voice  \n   \u2022 Earlier, \u201cI must speak\u201d and \u201cI must exercise my voice\u201d show Irgi\u2019s emphasis on auditory over telepathic methods, implying he was pleased to try direct communication and only resorted to telepathy secondarily.  \n\nII. Logical Argument: Why \u201cSurprise at Appearance\u201d Precedes Telepathy  \n1. Chronology: Physical Encounter Before Cortex Access  \n   \u2022 Irgi observes them \u201cin the square\u201d and explores their ship before considering mind\u2010reading. Cognitive science supports that most beings inspect physicality first.  \n2. No Prior Telepathy Attempts  \n   \u2022 The text cites only mind\u2010reading after physical restraint\u2014\u201cWhen the worst pain has passed, they will recover\u2026then they will realize I am their friend.\u201d If he were disappointed, he\u2019d abandon rather than \u201ccure\u201d them.  \n3. Motivated by Loneliness  \n   \u2022 As \u201cthe last of his race,\u201d Irgi\u2019s primary goal is companionship. Surprise and curiosity drive him to \u201cprepare\u201d them for \u201ccounsel,\u201d not to discard them as worthless telepaths.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDisappointment in Mind\u2010Contact\u201d Theory  \n1. Counter\u2010Evidence: Prolonged Effort to Enable Communication  \n   \u2022 Disappointment implies abandonment. Yet Irgi uses \u201cClamps,\u201d \u201cChamber of the Cones,\u201d \u201cBlock and Cones\u201d to equip them for immortality. He never abandons the project when mind\u2010contact falters.  \n2. Voice Preference Over Telepathy  \n   \u2022 \u201cI must speak\u2026That is the law of nature.\u201d He initially expects voice communication. The mind\u2010reading apparatus is \u201can experiment\u201d (\u201cI wonder if they\u2019ve perfected this\u201d). Experiments denote curiosity, not frustration.  \n3. Text Does Not Attribute Negative Emotion to Failure  \n   \u2022 No lament or threat when the first screen images confuse him. Instead, he flips \u201cdials\u201d further to clarify. A disappointed being wouldn\u2019t spend time decoding \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d or medical imagery.  \n4. Post\u2010Vivisection Satisfaction Implied  \n   \u2022 He proceeds to the Chamber to bestow immortality, expecting gratitude. Only after the Earthmen recover do events turn tragic. His plans succeed, supporting that disappointment was never his driving emotion.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll the evidence shows that Irgi\u2019s predominant reaction upon meeting the Earthmen was astonishment at their novel physical form and potential companionship, not disappointment at initial telepathic failure. His \u201cqueer,\u201d \u201cunlike anything\u201d description, subsequent careful vivisection to \u201cprepare\u201d them, repeated use of his voice, and investment in their immortality all demonstrate surprise, curiosity, and hope\u2014not frustration or abandonment\u2014making \u201cSurprised at the way they looked\u201d the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis  \n   I maintain that Irgi was \u201cdisappointed they could not speak to him through their minds,\u201d because:  \n   a. His prime motive throughout is companionship and mental communication, not mere aesthetic surprise.  \n   b. He repeatedly attempts to make his voice or his electrigraph mind\u2010screen work, only to find them inadequate.  \n   c. His subsequent actions\u2014preparing them for the Chamber of the Cones to \u201ccounsel\u201d them\u2014show he expects exchange of ideas, not merely study of their bodies.  \n\n2. Evidence of disappointment in mental communication  \n   \u2022 \u201cI must speak\u2026 That is the law of nature. It would atrophy\u2026 Yes, I will use my voice tonight\u2026 I will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background: Irgi repeatedly craves vocal communication</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Upon their arrival: he hears only a \u201cconfused, angry murmur\u201d via the ship\u2019s hull \u201cspeaker.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe metal of our hull is his loudspeaker\u2026 Whatever it is, it\u2019s lifting us.\u201d</invalid_quote> This murmur fails to convey ideas.  \n   \u2022 Laboratory: he binds them to use his electrigraph: \u201cPerhaps they can chart\u2026each curve\u2026represents a picture? I can translate\u2026 But can they?\u201d <invalid_quote>He questions the adequacy of their mind\u2010screen</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He \u201cflips over different dials\u201d to glean their memories (Mars cities, Washington statue) because the electrigraph is the only way to know their thoughts. He is \u201cglad\u201d and \u201cwishing Urgians alive to build a statue\u201d once he glimpses their history, confirming his central interest.  \n   \u2022 After \u201ccuring\u201d them with the red aura: \u201cThat will prepare their bodies\u2026 When they realize I am their friend, they will gladly hear my counsels!\u201d <invalid_quote>He explicitly intends to \u201ccounsel\u201d them\u2014i.e., exchange ideas mentally</invalid_quote>  \n\n3. They never demonstrate physical language compatibility  \n   \u2022 His own voice range (\u201cpitched eight vibrations to the second\u201d) may be inaudible without the hull. He never again tries vocal speech once in the city. Instead he exclusively relies on mental methods.  \n   \u2022 When they wake in pain, they understand only the agony and immediately try to free themselves for self\u2010interest, not to reply to any counsel. Their reactions prove mental exchange failed.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201csurprised at appearance\u201d theory  \n   \u2022 Irgi\u2019s cursory remark: \u201cStrange beings they might be\u2026 but they had mastered interplanetary travel.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI looked at the creatures\u2026 strange beings\u2026 they had mastered interplanetary travel.\u201d</invalid_quote> He shows respect and curiosity about their achievements, not shock.  \n   \u2022 His carrying them \u201ceasily, without trouble\u201d into his lab contradicts terror or repulsion. If mere surprise were primary, he\u2019d hesitate or destroy them; instead he treats them as prized specimens for mind\u2010link.  \n   \u2022 He spends \u201cweeks\u201d without speaking, bathing in the mist, building the Chamber of the Cones for immortality\u2014so he is methodical, not capricious. His loneliness is intellectual; he seeks to exchange ideas, not admire physique.  \n   \u2022 The only \u201csurprise\u201d is hearing the \u201cgreen beam\u201d lift their craft, but that is a reaction to its power, not to their bodily form. He does not pause to study their shape or comment further.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All of Irgi\u2019s actions\u2014from attempting voice communication, to employing the electrigraph, to preparing them for \u201ccounsel\u201d in the Cones\u2014demonstrate that his primary motive is mental discourse. His \u201cdisappointment\u201d in their inability to communicate mentally drives the narrative, whereas mere aesthetic surprise is a secondary, fleeting observation never again followed up. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Irgi felt disappointment at their inability to speak to him through their minds.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Surprised at the way they looked\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restating My Thesis  \n   I maintain that Irgi\u2019s dominant emotion was disappointment in his inability to establish mental communication with the newcomers, not mere visual surprise.

Irgi\u2019s Actions Reveal Prioritization of Mental Exchange  \r\n   a. \u201cI must speak\u2026 That is the law of nature\u2026 I will talk to them\u2026\u201d  \r\n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI must use my voice tonight\u2026 I will talk\u2026 and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \r\n      \u2022 Irgi does not bask in their appearance; he immediately seeks speech.

He is \u201cglad\u201d at each glimpse of their memories, confirming his fascination with their mental content.  \r\n   d. \u201cCounsel\u201d after Red Aura Treatment  \r\n      \u2022 <quote>of the Cones,\" he said. \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my counsels!\"</quote> (background)  \r\n      \u2022 His whole grand design\u2014vivisection plus the Chamber of the Cones\u2014aims to cure them so that they can \u201chear\u201d his mental \u201ccounsels.\u201d He never mentions an interest in their bodies apart from allowing communication.  \r\n\r\n3. Debunking \u201cSurprise at Appearance\u201d as Primary Reaction  \r\n   a. Lack of Hesitation or Fear  \n      \u2022 He \u201ccarries them easily\u201d into his city (background), showing no awe or terror. If mere visual novelty had overwhelmed him, he'd display hesitation or destruction, not meticulous transport and care.  \r\n   b. No Further Descriptive Commentary on Form  \n      \u2022 The sole \u201cqueer beings\u201d phrase occurs at first sight; thereafter, all narrative descriptions concern their minds, not their limbs or tentacles. Disappointed beings do not fixate on the exterior.  \r\n   c. Voice Exercises Persist After Arrival  \n      \u2022 He never abandons vocal attempts even in the lab: the red\u2010aura treatment \u201cprepares bodies\u201d for conversational exchange. If mere surprise sufficed, he would study or idolize them like static specimens, not pursue dynamic discourse.  \r\n   d. No Evidence of Aesthetic Admiration  \n      \u2022 Although he \u201cwishes Urgians alive to build statues\u201d for him, that arises from his telegraph\u2010gleaned memories, not from the newcomers\u2019 physical attributes. His longing for fame is intellectual, not bodily.  \r\n\r\n4. Refuting Specific Arguments of Debater_A  \r\n   a. \u201cVivisection Implies Curiosity, Not Disappointment\u201d  \n      \u2022 Precisely: curiosity for mental interaction. Vivisection is the sole means to access their thoughts. His \u201csimple experiment\u201d screen is a probing of their intellect, not a study of their anatomy.  \r\n   b. \u201cVoice Preference Over Telepathy Shows Aural Focus\u201d  \n      \u2022 Voice is his first attempt only because it is his native method. When that fails (murmurs unintelligible), he immediately resorts to electrigraph. Frustration at speech drives innovation, not disdain for mind\u2010link.  \r\n   c. \u201cPreparation for Immortality Proves Benevolence, Not Frustration\u201d  \n      \u2022 Benevolence is a vehicle to secure willing minds for \u201ccounsel.\u201d He will only grant immortality if they \u201chear\u201d his mental teachings. He requires them mentally alive and responsive\u2014otherwise immortality is worthless to his loneliness.  \r\n   d. \u201cNo Negative Emotion Textually Attributed to Failure\u201d  \n      \u2022 The narrative absence of overt anger does not imply absence of disappointment. His exhaustive, prolonged methods\u2014weeks of vocal practice, multiple experiments\u2014convey persistence born of frustration, not amusement. Each new apparatus is a response to a failed previous attempt.  \r\n\r\n5. Conclusion  \n   Irgi\u2019s entire sequence of efforts\u2014vocal exercise, hull\u2010borne murmurs, electrigraph screen, vivisection, body\u2010preparing red aura, and the final Chamber of the Cones\u2014are all aimed at obtaining mental dialogue. His endurance of solitude \u201cfor hundreds and hundreds of years\u201d and his yearning to \u201ccounsel\u201d newly cured minds underscore his disappointment and determination to overcome their mute silence. The fleeting visual remark \u201cqueer beings\u201d is secondary. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Irgi felt disappointment at their inability to speak to him through their minds.",

No Evidence of Aesthetic Admiration  \n      \u2022 Although he \u201cwishes Urgians alive to build statues\u201d for him, that arises from his telegraph\u2010gleaned memories, not from the newcomers\u2019 physical attributes. His longing for fame is intellectual, not bodily.  \r\n\r\n4. Refuting Specific Arguments of Debater_A  \r\n   a. \u201cVivisection Implies Curiosity, Not Disappointment\u201d  \n      \u2022 Precisely: curiosity for mental interaction. Vivisection is the sole means to access their thoughts. His \u201csimple experiment\u201d screen is a probing of their intellect, not a study of their anatomy.  \r\n   b. \u201cVoice Preference Over Telepathy Shows Aural Focus\u201d  \n      \u2022 Voice is his first attempt only because it is his native method. When that fails (murmurs unintelligible), he immediately resorts to electrigraph. Frustration at speech drives innovation, not disdain for mind\u2010link.  \r\n   c. \u201cPreparation for Immortality Proves Benevolence, Not Frustration\u201d  \n      \u2022 Benevolence is a vehicle to secure willing minds for \u201ccounsel.\u201d He will only grant immortality if they \u201chear\u201d his mental teachings. He requires them mentally alive and responsive\u2014otherwise immortality is worthless to his loneliness.  \r\n   d. \u201cNo Negative Emotion Textually Attributed to Failure\u201d  \n      \u2022 The narrative absence of overt anger does not imply absence of disappointment. His exhaustive, prolonged methods\u2014weeks of vocal practice, multiple experiments\u2014convey persistence born of frustration, not amusement. Each new apparatus is a response to a failed previous attempt.  \r\n\r\n5. Conclusion  \n   Irgi\u2019s entire sequence of efforts\u2014vocal exercise, hull\u2010borne murmurs, electrigraph screen, vivisection, body\u2010preparing red aura, and the final Chamber of the Cones\u2014are all aimed at obtaining mental dialogue. His endurance of solitude \u201cfor hundreds and hundreds of years\u201d and his yearning to \u201ccounsel\u201d newly cured minds underscore his disappointment and determination to overcome their mute silence. The fleeting visual remark \u201cqueer beings\u201d is secondary. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Irgi felt disappointment at their inability to speak to him through their minds.",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Irgi feel after meeting the men?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprised at the way they looked\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis  \n   I maintain that Irgi was \u201cdisappointed they could not speak to him through their minds,\u201d because:  \n   a. His prime motive throughout is companionship and mental communication, not mere aesthetic surprise.  \n   b. He repeatedly attempts to make his voice or his electrigraph mind\u2010screen work, only to find them inadequate.  \n   c. His subsequent actions\u2014preparing them for the Chamber of the Cones to \u201ccounsel\u201d them\u2014show he expects exchange of ideas, not merely study of their bodies.  \n\n2.

Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201csurprised at appearance\u201d theory  \n   \u2022 Irgi\u2019s cursory remark: \u201cStrange beings they might be\u2026 but they had mastered interplanetary travel.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI looked at the creatures\u2026 strange beings\u2026 they had mastered interplanetary travel.\u201d</invalid_quote> He shows respect and curiosity about their achievements, not shock.  \n   \u2022 His carrying them \u201ceasily, without trouble\u201d into his lab contradicts terror or repulsion. If mere surprise were primary, he\u2019d hesitate or destroy them; instead he treats them as prized specimens for mind\u2010link.  \n   \u2022 He spends \u201cweeks\u201d without speaking, bathing in the mist, building the Chamber of the Cones for immortality\u2014so he is methodical, not capricious. His loneliness is intellectual; he seeks to exchange ideas, not admire physique.  \n   \u2022 The only \u201csurprise\u201d is hearing the \u201cgreen beam\u201d lift their craft, but that is a reaction to its power, not to their bodily form.

Conclusion  \n   All of Irgi\u2019s actions\u2014from attempting voice communication, to employing the electrigraph, to preparing them for \u201ccounsel\u201d in the Cones\u2014demonstrate that his primary motive is mental discourse. His \u201cdisappointment\u201d in their inability to communicate mentally drives the narrative, whereas mere aesthetic surprise is a secondary, fleeting observation never again followed up. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Irgi felt disappointment at their inability to speak to him through their minds.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Case: Irgi\u2019s Reaction Was One of Surprise and Curious Wonder at Their Appearance, Not Disappointment in Telepathy  \n\nI. Textual Evidence of Surprise at Appearance  \n1. \u201cQueer beings they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived\u201d  \n   \u2022 Irgi labels the Earthmen \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cunlike anything\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 This language reflects astonishment at their physical form and weak limbs.  \n2. Hesitation Before Hostility  \n   \u2022 Irgi \u201clooked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it\u2026 Strange beings they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel\u201d  \n   \u2022 His decision to carry them \u201ceasily\u201d into his city and seek to \u201cconverse\u201d shows openness, driven by curiosity about their form and ability, not immediate telepathic frustration.  \n3. Desire for Companionship and Statues  \n   \u2022 \u201cThese creatures would gladly build statues to him!\u201d  \n   \u2022 He fantasizes about fame and immortal glory afforded by their \u201cmemories,\u201d indicating positive surprise at meeting other intelligent life.  \n4. Active Pursuit of Mind\u2010Contact via Vivisection  \n   \u2022 Irgi restrains them and \u201cprepare[s] their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones\u201d so they will \u201cgladly hear my counsels\u201d once cured.  \n   \u2022 If disappointment in mind\u2010contact was his reaction, he would not inflict agony nor bother with elaborate vivisection; he would abandon them. Instead, he invests effort to make them \u201cfriends.\u201d  \n5. Repeated Exercises of Voice  \n   \u2022 Earlier, \u201cI must speak\u201d and \u201cI must exercise my voice\u201d show Irgi\u2019s emphasis on auditory over telepathic methods, implying he was pleased to try direct communication and only resorted to telepathy secondarily.  \n\nII. Logical Argument: Why \u201cSurprise at Appearance\u201d Precedes Telepathy  \n1. Chronology: Physical Encounter Before Cortex Access  \n   \u2022 Irgi observes them \u201cin the square\u201d and explores their ship before considering mind\u2010reading. Cognitive science supports that most beings inspect physicality first.  \n2. No Prior Telepathy Attempts  \n   \u2022 The text cites only mind\u2010reading after physical restraint\u2014\u201cWhen the worst pain has passed, they will recover\u2026then they will realize I am their friend.\u201d If he were disappointed, he\u2019d abandon rather than \u201ccure\u201d them.  \n3. Motivated by Loneliness  \n   \u2022 As \u201cthe last of his race,\u201d Irgi\u2019s primary goal is companionship. Surprise and curiosity drive him to \u201cprepare\u201d them for \u201ccounsel,\u201d not to discard them as worthless telepaths.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDisappointment in Mind\u2010Contact\u201d Theory  \n1. Counter\u2010Evidence: Prolonged Effort to Enable Communication  \n   \u2022 Disappointment implies abandonment. Yet Irgi uses \u201cClamps,\u201d \u201cChamber of the Cones,\u201d \u201cBlock and Cones\u201d to equip them for immortality. He never abandons the project when mind\u2010contact falters.  \n2. Voice Preference Over Telepathy  \n   \u2022 \u201cI must speak\u2026That is the law of nature.\u201d He initially expects voice communication. The mind\u2010reading apparatus is \u201can experiment\u201d (\u201cI wonder if they\u2019ve perfected this\u201d). Experiments denote curiosity, not frustration.  \n3. Text Does Not Attribute Negative Emotion to Failure  \n   \u2022 No lament or threat when the first screen images confuse him. Instead, he flips \u201cdials\u201d further to clarify. A disappointed being wouldn\u2019t spend time decoding \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d or medical imagery.  \n4. Post\u2010Vivisection Satisfaction Implied  \n   \u2022 He proceeds to the Chamber to bestow immortality, expecting gratitude. Only after the Earthmen recover do events turn tragic. His plans succeed, supporting that disappointment was never his driving emotion.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll the evidence shows that Irgi\u2019s predominant reaction upon meeting the Earthmen was astonishment at their novel physical form and potential companionship, not disappointment at initial telepathic failure. His \u201cqueer,\u201d \u201cunlike anything\u201d description, subsequent careful vivisection to \u201cprepare\u201d them, repeated use of his voice, and investment in their immortality all demonstrate surprise, curiosity, and hope\u2014not frustration or abandonment\u2014making \u201cSurprised at the way they looked\u201d the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

He marvels at their \u201cweak little limbs\u201d (background), calling them \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cstrange.\u201d True disappointment would prompt immediate destruction or abandonment, yet he \u201ccarried them easily \u2026 without trouble,\u201d showing fascination with their form and capabilities.  \n  b. \u201cStrange beings they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel\u201d  \n     \u2022 He admires their technological achievement (\u00c2 background, p.\u200927) despite their \u201cweak\u201d physique. Such admiration underscores that his primary interest is physical novelty and potential companionship.  \n\n2. Vocal Communication as Primary Means  \n  a. \u201cI must speak \u2026 I have not spoken for many weeks \u2026 I will talk to them\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi explicitly states three times that he needs to use his voice and address the stars and visitors (background). This is his \u201claw of nature\u201d (background), showing his expectation of spoken communication before any mind\u2010reading.  \n  b. No abandonment after failed voice attempts  \n     \u2022 Even though his voice \u201cmurmur\u201d on their hull proved garbled, he still returns them to the mist and spares no effort\u2014he \u201cprepares their bodies,\u201d builds the Chamber of the Cones, and plans to \u201ccounsel\u201d them\u2014rather than destroy malfunctioning telepaths.  \n\n3. Mind\u2010Reading as Experimental, Secondary Method  \n  a. \u201cPerhaps they can chart \u2026 each curve \u2026 represents a picture? I wonder if they\u2019ve perfected this\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi\u2019s language (\u201cwonder,\u201d \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cif\u201d) marks the electrigraph as an experiment born of curiosity about a new species, not frustration at failed telepathy. He \u201cflips over different dials\u201d to clarify obscure images (Washington statue, salt mines). Scientists show curiosity when experimenting, not despair.  \n  b. Investment of Time and Resources  \n     \u2022 He endures the agony\u2010inducing \u201cpreparation\u201d rays, risking their destruction and violating them physically\u2014drastic measures for mere \u201cdisappointment.\u201d His goal is to \u201ccure\u201d them first (background), implying disease, not communication, is the barrier. After curing, he expects voice and mind\u2010link to succeed.  \n\n4. Positive Expectations and Hope for Physical Companionship  \n  a. \u201cThey would gladly build statues to me \u2026 I could save a nation\u201d  \n     \u2022 Irgi fantasizes about fame and companionship among beings who \u201cmeant nothing\u201d to his marble halls (background). These forward\u2010looking plans reflect hope rooted in their physical presence and mutual ability to converse once cured.  \n  b. His repeated \u201cloneliness\u201d appeals are addressed vocally  \n     \u2022 He intends to \u201cexercise my voice\u201d once more \u201cunder the dome\u201d (background), indicating that spoken interaction remains his first choice.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDisappointment in Telepathy\u201d  \n  a. No text\u2010based expression of anger or rejection at mind\u2010reading failure  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s thesis predicts that Irgi would show overt disappointment. Yet the text records neither threats nor abandonment when the electrigraph yields only confusing images. Instead, Irgi refines settings and proceeds to cure them physically.  \n  b. The Earthmen\u2019s escape breaks off any chance of mind\u2010exchange  \n     \u2022 After they recover, they \u201cbellow and scream\u201d and flee; the misunderstanding stems from their fear of agony (background), not from telepathic failure. Only then does Irgi confront \u201ctreacherous\u201d behavior, not before. Thus failure of communication occurs only after Irgi\u2019s cure plan\u2014and only because they misinterpret his benevolence.  \n  c. If true disappointment were his reaction, he would not have \u201cprepared\u201d them for immortality  \n     \u2022 A disappointed being would destroy or flee; Irgi invests \u201cquartzes,\u201d \u201ccontrol panels,\u201d \u201cjewel\u2010inset levers\u201d in building the Chamber (background). He even releases the mist to protect them from disease. Physical preservation precedes mental link, showing his priority is companionship with these novel bodies.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll available evidence\u2014from Irgi\u2019s repeated insistence on vocal discourse, his wonder at their \u201cqueer\u201d form, his painstaking medical \u201cpreparation\u201d and elaborate Cures\u2014demonstrates that his reaction was one of astonishment at their appearance and potential companionship, not mere disappointment in initial telepathy. The correct answer is therefore \u201cSurprised at the way they looked.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   I maintain that Irgi\u2019s dominant emotion was disappointment in his inability to establish mental communication with the newcomers, not mere visual surprise. His every action\u2014vocal practice, electrigraph experiments, vivisection, preparation for the Chamber of the Cones\u2014centers on eliciting thoughts, memories, and words from them.    \r\n\r\n2. Irgi\u2019s Actions Reveal Prioritization of Mental Exchange  \r\n   a. \u201cI must speak\u2026 That is the law of nature\u2026 I will talk to them\u2026\u201d  \r\n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI must use my voice tonight\u2026 I will talk\u2026 and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \r\n      \u2022 Irgi does not bask in their appearance; he immediately seeks speech. His \u201cvoice\u201d atrophies without use, showing his existential need for communication.  \r\n   b. Reliance on Hull as Loudspeaker  \r\n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe metal of our hull is his loudspeaker\u2026 Maybe somebody trying to speak to us.\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \r\n      \u2022 He measures and tests audible murmur, hoping for intelligible reply, even risking lifting and transporting them solely by activating his beam.  \r\n   c. Vivisection and Electrigraph Screen as \u201cExperiment\u201d  \r\n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps they can chart\u2026each curve\u2026represents a picture? I can translate\u2026But can they?\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \r\n      \u2022 He explicitly wonders whether their brain\u2010wave curves \u201crepresent pictures,\u201d then \u201cflips over different dials\u201d to decipher civilized scenes. He is \u201cglad\u201d at each glimpse of their memories, confirming his fascination with their mental content.  \r\n   d. \u201cCounsel\u201d after Red Aura Treatment  \r\n      \u2022 <quote>of the Cones,\" he said. \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my counsels!\"</quote> (background)  \r\n      \u2022 His whole grand design\u2014vivisection plus the Chamber of the Cones\u2014aims to cure them so that they can \u201chear\u201d his mental \u201ccounsels.\u201d He never mentions an interest in their bodies apart from allowing communication.  \r\n\r\n3. Debunking \u201cSurprise at Appearance\u201d as Primary Reaction  \r\n   a. Lack of Hesitation or Fear  \n      \u2022 He \u201ccarries them easily\u201d into his city (background), showing no awe or terror. If mere visual novelty had overwhelmed him, he'd display hesitation or destruction, not meticulous transport and care.  \r\n   b. No Further Descriptive Commentary on Form  \n      \u2022 The sole \u201cqueer beings\u201d phrase occurs at first sight; thereafter, all narrative descriptions concern their minds, not their limbs or tentacles. Disappointed beings do not fixate on the exterior.  \r\n   c. Voice Exercises Persist After Arrival  \n      \u2022 He never abandons vocal attempts even in the lab: the red\u2010aura treatment \u201cprepares bodies\u201d for conversational exchange. If mere surprise sufficed, he would study or idolize them like static specimens, not pursue dynamic discourse.  \r\n   d. No Evidence of Aesthetic Admiration  \n      \u2022 Although he \u201cwishes Urgians alive to build statues\u201d for him, that arises from his telegraph\u2010gleaned memories, not from the newcomers\u2019 physical attributes. His longing for fame is intellectual, not bodily.  \r\n\r\n4. Refuting Specific Arguments of Debater_A  \r\n   a. \u201cVivisection Implies Curiosity, Not Disappointment\u201d  \n      \u2022 Precisely: curiosity for mental interaction. Vivisection is the sole means to access their thoughts. His \u201csimple experiment\u201d screen is a probing of their intellect, not a study of their anatomy.  \r\n   b. \u201cVoice Preference Over Telepathy Shows Aural Focus\u201d  \n      \u2022 Voice is his first attempt only because it is his native method. When that fails (murmurs unintelligible), he immediately resorts to electrigraph. Frustration at speech drives innovation, not disdain for mind\u2010link.  \r\n   c. \u201cPreparation for Immortality Proves Benevolence, Not Frustration\u201d  \n      \u2022 Benevolence is a vehicle to secure willing minds for \u201ccounsel.\u201d He will only grant immortality if they \u201chear\u201d his mental teachings. He requires them mentally alive and responsive\u2014otherwise immortality is worthless to his loneliness.  \r\n   d. \u201cNo Negative Emotion Textually Attributed to Failure\u201d  \n      \u2022 The narrative absence of overt anger does not imply absence of disappointment. His exhaustive, prolonged methods\u2014weeks of vocal practice, multiple experiments\u2014convey persistence born of frustration, not amusement. Each new apparatus is a response to a failed previous attempt.  \r\n\r\n5. Conclusion  \n   Irgi\u2019s entire sequence of efforts\u2014vocal exercise, hull\u2010borne murmurs, electrigraph screen, vivisection, body\u2010preparing red aura, and the final Chamber of the Cones\u2014are all aimed at obtaining mental dialogue. His endurance of solitude \u201cfor hundreds and hundreds of years\u201d and his yearning to \u201ccounsel\u201d newly cured minds underscore his disappointment and determination to overcome their mute silence. The fleeting visual remark \u201cqueer beings\u201d is secondary. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Irgi felt disappointment at their inability to speak to him through their minds.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
