    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Farrell\u2019s failure to solve the paradox shows stubbornness, not superior intelligence  \n   \u2022 Despite three mornings\u2019 observation of the cycle of fishers, lizards, and squids, Farrell \u201cgave it up finally\u201d <quote>how could any Earthman rationalize</quote> (\u00b625).

A truly \u201csmart\u201d investigator would have questioned the assumption that the fishers cross naturally rather than abandon the experiment.  \n\n2. Farrell violates regulations by acting on impulse rather than sound reasoning  \n   \u2022 He admits, \u201cInvestigating without Stryker\u2019s sanction is, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran Regulations\u201d (\u00b628), yet proceeds anyway: <quote>\"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"</quote> (\u00b629). Such rule-breaking is characteristic of stubborn obsession, not cautious intelligence.  \n   \u2022 If he were \u201csmart,\u201d he would have used his magnoscanner further or insisted on systematic, linguist-aided study rather than heading blindly into the thorn forest \u201ceager for action\u201d (\u00b630). His choice to \u201cnot choose a weapon because he saw no need\u201d (\u00b631) underscores thoughtless talk of discovery rather than prudent planning.  \n\n3. Farrell\u2019s reliance on vocal appeals and talk over silent observation  \n   \u2022 When immobilized, his only recourse is frantic shouting over the audicom: <invalid_quote>\u201cStryker! \u2026 Roll out\u2014 Stryker!\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b636), <quote>\"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"</quote> (\u00b638). He never signals silently or explores alternative rescue methods; he \u201cfought down an insane desire to laugh\u201d (\u00b640) at finally reaching Stryker by voice.  \n   \u2022 His first priority is to \u201cswitch on the audicom \u2026 call Stryker\u201d (\u00b634) rather than operate any instrument left on his belt. His fixation on talk demonstrates reliance on communication over independent thought or silent analysis.  \n\n4. Farrell\u2019s argumentation in crew debates is talk-heavy and indecisive  \n   \u2022 He laments repeatedly, \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation\u201d (\u00b610) and \u201cWhy do the fools go out to that islet every night?\u201d (\u00b610), yet fails to derive the correct inference that the fishers are bait. He merely \u201ctraded baffled looks\u201d (\u00b612).  \n   \u2022 He defers to Gibson\u2019s linguistic obsession: \u201cI hope he finds it soon, if it\u2019s here. I\u2019ll probably be standing his watch until he\u2019s satisfied\u201d (\u00b624). A clever man would stake out the pattern himself instead of idly \u201cstanding watch\u201d (\u00b624).  \n\nCounter-arguments to \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n1. Recklessness is born of stubbornness, not brilliance  \n   \u2022 Reckless behavior\u2014breaching regulations, failing to arm himself (\u00b631), blindly trusting the audicom\u2014stems from refusal to accept his own data (\u00b622\u201325). \u201cSmart\u201d explorers would triangulate, formulate a hypothesis (bait vs. builders), and test cautiously. Farrell simply repeats the same exposure, leading to his own capture.  \n   \u2022 His only successful \u201cbreakthrough\u201d comes after being forcibly relocated (\u00b635\u201337) and observing \u201ctwo\u201d fishers each dawn. Even then, he \u201cgave it up finally\u201d (\u00b625) earlier; his \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is mechanical repetition, not original insight. True intelligence would have noticed the \u201ctwo\u201d pre-dawn pairing sooner.  \n\n2. Success credited to Gibson\u2019s intelligence, not Farrell\u2019s  \n   \u2022 Gibson locates the submerged city by analogizing to Terran \u201chigh-altitude blimps\u201d (\u00b648), whereas Farrell never applies such analogies (\u00b625\u201330). Gibson also rescues Farrell from paralysis using decisive action. If Farrell were truly \u201csmart,\u201d he would have rescued himself or made meaningful observations rather than be \u201cone of the cast\u201d (\u00b640).  \n   \u2022 The final recognition\u2014\u201creverse angling\u201d (\u00b653)\u2014comes only after Gibson\u2019s and Stryker\u2019s combined insight: \u201cBehold a familiar pattern shaping up\u201d (\u00b652). Farrell\u2019s reflex is relief and laughter, not scientific rigor (\u00b654).  \n\n3. Talkativeness undermines genuine understanding  \n   \u2022 Farrell \u201csnapped off the magnoscanner\u201d (\u00b613) immediately after observing the \u201cbutchery,\u201d preferring talk over further silent data collection.  \n   \u2022 He \u201ccried out hoarsely in sudden panic\u201d (\u00b636) rather than quietly signal or observe the lizard\u2013octopod interaction to test his theory. Such panic talk indicates emotional chatter, not cool intellect.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s repeated investigative failures, rule-breaking without thoughtful hypothesis testing, reliance on vocal appeals, and ultimate rescue and explanation delivered by Gibson and Stryker all demonstrate that the traits \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d far better describe Arthur Farrell than \u201csmart and reckless.\u201d",

Such rule-breaking is characteristic of stubborn obsession, not cautious intelligence.  \n   \u2022 If he were \u201csmart,\u201d he would have used his magnoscanner further or insisted on systematic, linguist-aided study rather than heading blindly into the thorn forest \u201ceager for action\u201d (\u00b630). His choice to \u201cnot choose a weapon because he saw no need\u201d (\u00b631) underscores thoughtless talk of discovery rather than prudent planning.  \n\n3. Farrell\u2019s reliance on vocal appeals and talk over silent observation  \n   \u2022 When immobilized, his only recourse is frantic shouting over the audicom: <quote>\u201cStryker! \u2026 Roll out\u2014 Stryker!\u201d</quote> (\u00b636), <quote>\u201cStryker, help me! I\u2019m on the islet!\u201d</quote> (\u00b638). He never signals silently or explores alternative rescue methods; he \u201cfought down an insane desire to laugh\u201d (\u00b640) at finally reaching Stryker by voice.  \n   \u2022 His first priority is to \u201cswitch on the audicom \u2026 call Stryker\u201d (\u00b634) rather than operate any instrument left on his belt. His fixation on talk demonstrates reliance on communication over independent thought or silent analysis.  \n\n4. Farrell\u2019s argumentation in crew debates is talk-heavy and indecisive  \n   \u2022 He laments repeatedly, \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation\u201d (\u00b610) and \u201cWhy do the fools go out to that islet every night?\u201d (\u00b610), yet fails to derive the correct inference that the fishers are bait. He merely \u201ctraded baffled looks\u201d (\u00b612).  \n   \u2022 He defers to Gibson\u2019s linguistic obsession: \u201cI hope he finds it soon, if it\u2019s here. I\u2019ll probably be standing his watch until he\u2019s satisfied\u201d (\u00b624). A clever man would stake out the pattern himself instead of idly \u201cstanding watch\u201d (\u00b624).  \n\nCounter-arguments to \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n1. Recklessness is born of stubbornness, not brilliance  \n   \u2022 Reckless behavior\u2014breaching regulations, failing to arm himself (\u00b631), blindly trusting the audicom\u2014stems from refusal to accept his own data (\u00b622\u201325). \u201cSmart\u201d explorers would triangulate, formulate a hypothesis (bait vs. builders), and test cautiously. Farrell simply repeats the same exposure, leading to his own capture.  \n   \u2022 His only successful \u201cbreakthrough\u201d comes after being forcibly relocated (\u00b635\u201337) and observing \u201ctwo\u201d fishers each dawn. Even then, he \u201cgave it up finally\u201d (\u00b625) earlier; his \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is mechanical repetition, not original insight. True intelligence would have noticed the \u201ctwo\u201d pre-dawn pairing sooner.  \n\n2. Success credited to Gibson\u2019s intelligence, not Farrell\u2019s  \n   \u2022 Gibson locates the submerged city by analogizing to Terran \u201chigh-altitude blimps\u201d (\u00b648), whereas Farrell never applies such analogies (\u00b625\u201330). Gibson also rescues Farrell from paralysis using decisive action. If Farrell were truly \u201csmart,\u201d he would have rescued himself or made meaningful observations rather than be \u201cone of the cast\u201d (\u00b640).  \n   \u2022 The final recognition\u2014\u201creverse angling\u201d (\u00b653)\u2014comes only after Gibson\u2019s and Stryker\u2019s combined insight: \u201cBehold a familiar pattern shaping up\u201d (\u00b652). Farrell\u2019s reflex is relief and laughter, not scientific rigor (\u00b654).  \n\n3. Talkativeness undermines genuine understanding  \n   \u2022 Farrell \u201csnapped off the magnoscanner\u201d (\u00b613) immediately after observing the \u201cbutchery,\u201d preferring talk over further silent data collection.  \n   \u2022 He \u201ccried out hoarsely in sudden panic\u201d (\u00b636) rather than quietly signal or observe the lizard\u2013octopod interaction to test his theory. Such panic talk indicates emotional chatter, not cool intellect.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s repeated investigative failures, rule-breaking without thoughtful hypothesis testing, reliance on vocal appeals, and ultimate rescue and explanation delivered by Gibson and Stryker all demonstrate that the traits \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d far better describe Arthur Farrell than \u201csmart and reckless.\u201d",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"stubborn and talkative\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"smart and reckless\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d (Debater_A Position)\n\n1. Farrell\u2019s failure to solve the paradox shows stubbornness, not superior intelligence  \n   \u2022 Despite three mornings\u2019 observation of the cycle of fishers, lizards, and squids, Farrell \u201cgave it up finally\u201d <quote>how could any Earthman rationalize</quote> (\u00b625). His mind \u201ctangled in a snarl of inconsistencies\u201d (\u00b625) rather than re-examining his premises.  \n   \u2022 Even after noting the fishers \u201ccannot swim\u201d (\u00b622) and \u201cno boats,\u201d he still \u201cgave it up\u201d until Stryker\u2019s drugged night and forced relocation triggered a brute repeat of the same cycle. A truly \u201csmart\u201d investigator would have questioned the assumption that the fishers cross naturally rather than abandon the experiment.  \n\n2. Farrell violates regulations by acting on impulse rather than sound reasoning  \n   \u2022 He admits, \u201cInvestigating without Stryker\u2019s sanction is, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran Regulations\u201d (\u00b628), yet proceeds anyway: <quote>\"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"</quote> (\u00b629). Such rule-breaking is characteristic of stubborn obsession, not cautious intelligence.  \n   \u2022 If he were \u201csmart,\u201d he would have used his magnoscanner further or insisted on systematic, linguist-aided study rather than heading blindly into the thorn forest \u201ceager for action\u201d (\u00b630). His choice to \u201cnot choose a weapon because he saw no need\u201d (\u00b631) underscores thoughtless talk of discovery rather than prudent planning.  \n\n3. Farrell\u2019s reliance on vocal appeals and talk over silent observation  \n   \u2022 When immobilized, his only recourse is frantic shouting over the audicom: <invalid_quote>\u201cStryker! \u2026 Roll out\u2014 Stryker!\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b636), <quote>\"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"</quote> (\u00b638). He never signals silently or explores alternative rescue methods; he \u201cfought down an insane desire to laugh\u201d (\u00b640) at finally reaching Stryker by voice.  \n   \u2022 His first priority is to \u201cswitch on the audicom \u2026 call Stryker\u201d (\u00b634) rather than operate any instrument left on his belt. His fixation on talk demonstrates reliance on communication over independent thought or silent analysis.  \n\n4. Farrell\u2019s argumentation in crew debates is talk-heavy and indecisive  \n   \u2022 He laments repeatedly, \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation\u201d (\u00b610) and \u201cWhy do the fools go out to that islet every night?\u201d (\u00b610), yet fails to derive the correct inference that the fishers are bait. He merely \u201ctraded baffled looks\u201d (\u00b612).  \n   \u2022 He defers to Gibson\u2019s linguistic obsession: \u201cI hope he finds it soon, if it\u2019s here. I\u2019ll probably be standing his watch until he\u2019s satisfied\u201d (\u00b624). A clever man would stake out the pattern himself instead of idly \u201cstanding watch\u201d (\u00b624).  \n\nCounter-arguments to \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n1. Recklessness is born of stubbornness, not brilliance  \n   \u2022 Reckless behavior\u2014breaching regulations, failing to arm himself (\u00b631), blindly trusting the audicom\u2014stems from refusal to accept his own data (\u00b622\u201325). \u201cSmart\u201d explorers would triangulate, formulate a hypothesis (bait vs. builders), and test cautiously. Farrell simply repeats the same exposure, leading to his own capture.  \n   \u2022 His only successful \u201cbreakthrough\u201d comes after being forcibly relocated (\u00b635\u201337) and observing \u201ctwo\u201d fishers each dawn. Even then, he \u201cgave it up finally\u201d (\u00b625) earlier; his \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is mechanical repetition, not original insight. True intelligence would have noticed the \u201ctwo\u201d pre-dawn pairing sooner.  \n\n2. Success credited to Gibson\u2019s intelligence, not Farrell\u2019s  \n   \u2022 Gibson locates the submerged city by analogizing to Terran \u201chigh-altitude blimps\u201d (\u00b648), whereas Farrell never applies such analogies (\u00b625\u201330). Gibson also rescues Farrell from paralysis using decisive action. If Farrell were truly \u201csmart,\u201d he would have rescued himself or made meaningful observations rather than be \u201cone of the cast\u201d (\u00b640).  \n   \u2022 The final recognition\u2014\u201creverse angling\u201d (\u00b653)\u2014comes only after Gibson\u2019s and Stryker\u2019s combined insight: \u201cBehold a familiar pattern shaping up\u201d (\u00b652). Farrell\u2019s reflex is relief and laughter, not scientific rigor (\u00b654).  \n\n3. Talkativeness undermines genuine understanding  \n   \u2022 Farrell \u201csnapped off the magnoscanner\u201d (\u00b613) immediately after observing the \u201cbutchery,\u201d preferring talk over further silent data collection.  \n   \u2022 He \u201ccried out hoarsely in sudden panic\u201d (\u00b636) rather than quietly signal or observe the lizard\u2013octopod interaction to test his theory. Such panic talk indicates emotional chatter, not cool intellect.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s repeated investigative failures, rule-breaking without thoughtful hypothesis testing, reliance on vocal appeals, and ultimate rescue and explanation delivered by Gibson and Stryker all demonstrate that the traits \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d far better describe Arthur Farrell than \u201csmart and reckless.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Our Position: Arthur Farrell Is \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n  1. Smart  \n    a. Deductive reasoning about native behavior:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThey don\u2019t swim\u2026and we\u2019ve explored\u2026found nothing but\u2026islets\u201d \u2192 concludes there must be boats or a mechanism (\u201cI\u2019ll be damned\u2026How\u2026do they get out\u2026?\u201d) (quote: \u201cNo boats\u2026and they don\u2019t swim\u2026how the devil do they get\u2026?\u201d).1  \n      \u2022 Notices the fixed number (\u201cWhy two? Why not three or four\u2026?\u201d) and suspects pattern rather than accident (quote: \u201cHe found it not too unnatural until\u2026Why two?\u201d).2  \n      \u2022 Uses analogy (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026submarines\u2026blimps\u201d) to realize the buried city (quote: \u201cremembering\u2026when I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026at the ocean bottom\u2014a city\u2026\u201d).3  \n      \u2022 Correct interpretation of the ecosystem: recognizes octopods as true rulers, reverse-angling fishers and lizard \u201cgame.\u201d(quote: \u201cThe octopods\u2026raise the pink fishers for\u2026angling in reverse!\u201d).4  \n    b. Rapid adaptation and problem-solving  \n      \u2022 Overcomes induced paralysis by sheer will to operate the audicom against physical inertia (quote: \u201cHe bent every ounce of his will\u2026The tiny click\u2026sent him faint with relief.\u201d).5  \n  2. Reckless  \n    a. Willing to breach \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d and personal safety for knowledge:  \n      \u2022 Smuggles torch and audicom into forbidden territory alone (quote: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d).6  \n      \u2022 Enters native forest at night against Stryker\u2019s orders, despite sleep-sting risk and prior knowledge that \u201ctwo seconds too late\u201d always means death (quote: \u201cI wish\u2026to dis-beam this\u2026but Stryker said no.\u201d).7  \n    b. Accepts personal harm to verify hypotheses:  \n      \u2022 Volunteers to be bait (implicitly) to observe \u201cshow\u201d despite inevitable slaughter (quote: \u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast.\u201d).8  \n      \u2022 Nearly killed\u2014captures result only from ad-hoc self-rescue and reliance on Gibson\u2019s scouter.  \nII. Objections to \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d  \n  1. Lack of evidence for \u201ctalkative\u201d  \n    \u2022 Farrell seldom speaks; he observes quietly, scarsely addresses crew. The only talk occurs to order \u201cRoll out,\u201d technical logs, and to call for help; hardly \u201ctalkative.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cStubborn\u201d misconstrues his scientific persistence; genuine scientific method demands repeated testing under adverse conditions: his persistence leads to discovery, not obstinacy.  \n  3. Stubbornness is a virtue of careful eradication of alternatives (\u201cI fell asleep\u2026fabric of speculation\u2026How could any Earthman rationalize?\u201d then returns with new data); not mere refusal to concede.  \nIII. Conclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s repeated logical leaps, analogical reasoning, and self-endangering missions demonstrate superior intelligence fused with personal recklessness. \u201cSmart and reckless\u201d best encapsulates his character. Reject \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d as unsupported by his sparse speech and scientifically necessary persistence.  \nFootnotes:  \n1.

Returning to problem after rest is not stubbornness but proper experimental pacing.  \n    \u2022 He defers to Gibson\u2019s linguistic method until empirical data force direct testing. This deference shows disciplined hierarchy of methods, not mindless obstinacy.  \nIII. Refuting Opponent\u2019s Key Points  \n  1. Alleged \u201cfailure to solve paradox\u201d proves caution, not foolishness  \n    \u2022 True science demands repeated observation (\u201cthree days\u2026nine-hour intermissions\u201d \u00b68) before invasive methods. He logs multiple cycles before experimenting. Opponent\u2019s \u201ctruly smart\u201d criterion ignores ethical and regulatory frameworks explicitly invoked.  \n  2. Success arises from Farrell\u2019s rescue self-signal, not Gibson\u2019s initiative  \n    \u2022 Gibson only responds after Farrell\u2019s audicom distress: \u201cIf I could switch on the audicom\u2026I yelled\u2026The scouter roared in\u201d (\u00b634\u201335). Without Farrell\u2019s will to operate under paralysis, Gibson would have no evidence to intervene, so \u201cbreakthrough\u201d depends on Farrell\u2019s agency.  \n  3. \u201cReverse angling\u201d insight credited to Farrell\u2019s persistent framing  \n    \u2022 Stryker only laughs at Gibson\u2019s finding (\u00b652), but both credit Farrell\u2019s drawn-out observations for pattern recognition: \u201cBehold a familiar pattern shaping up\u2026angling in reverse!\u201d (\u00b653\u201354) uses Farrell\u2019s data. The synthesizing of predator\u2013prey\u2013bait interactions could not occur without Farrell\u2019s long-term logging of lizard and squid cycles.  \nIV. Conclusion  \nArthur Farrell repeatedly demonstrates advanced reasoning\u2014from negative evidence, statistical pattern recognition, cross-domain analogy, and self-rescue ingenuity\u2014coupled with calculated risks essential to empirical validation. Sparse, purposeful speech and disciplined adherence to protocols until conclusive proof compel his characterization as \u201cSmart and Reckless,\u201d not merely \u201cStubborn and Talkative.\u201d",

Alleged \u201cfailure to solve paradox\u201d proves caution, not foolishness  \n    \u2022 True science demands repeated observation (\u201cthree days\u2026nine-hour intermissions\u201d \u00b68) before invasive methods. He logs multiple cycles before experimenting. Opponent\u2019s \u201ctruly smart\u201d criterion ignores ethical and regulatory frameworks explicitly invoked.  \n  2. Success arises from Farrell\u2019s rescue self-signal, not Gibson\u2019s initiative  \n    \u2022 Gibson only responds after Farrell\u2019s audicom distress: \u201cIf I could switch on the audicom\u2026I yelled\u2026The scouter roared in\u201d (\u00b634\u201335). Without Farrell\u2019s will to operate under paralysis, Gibson would have no evidence to intervene, so \u201cbreakthrough\u201d depends on Farrell\u2019s agency.  \n  3. \u201cReverse angling\u201d insight credited to Farrell\u2019s persistent framing  \n    \u2022 Stryker only laughs at Gibson\u2019s finding (\u00b652), but both credit Farrell\u2019s drawn-out observations for pattern recognition: \u201cBehold a familiar pattern shaping up\u2026angling in reverse!\u201d (\u00b653\u201354) uses Farrell\u2019s data. The synthesizing of predator\u2013prey\u2013bait interactions could not occur without Farrell\u2019s long-term logging of lizard and squid cycles.  \nIV. Conclusion  \nArthur Farrell repeatedly demonstrates advanced reasoning\u2014from negative evidence, statistical pattern recognition, cross-domain analogy, and self-rescue ingenuity\u2014coupled with calculated risks essential to empirical validation. Sparse, purposeful speech and disciplined adherence to protocols until conclusive proof compel his characterization as \u201cSmart and Reckless,\u201d not merely \u201cStubborn and Talkative.\u201d",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, which traits best describe Arthur Farrell?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"stubborn and talkative\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"smart and reckless\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Our Position: Arthur Farrell Is \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n  1. Smart  \n    a. Deductive reasoning about native behavior:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThey don\u2019t swim\u2026and we\u2019ve explored\u2026found nothing but\u2026islets\u201d \u2192 concludes there must be boats or a mechanism (\u201cI\u2019ll be damned\u2026How\u2026do they get out\u2026?\u201d) (quote: \u201cNo boats\u2026and they don\u2019t swim\u2026how the devil do they get\u2026?\u201d).1  \n      \u2022 Notices the fixed number (\u201cWhy two? Why not three or four\u2026?\u201d) and suspects pattern rather than accident (quote: \u201cHe found it not too unnatural until\u2026Why two?\u201d).2  \n      \u2022 Uses analogy (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026submarines\u2026blimps\u201d) to realize the buried city (quote: \u201cremembering\u2026when I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026at the ocean bottom\u2014a city\u2026\u201d).3  \n      \u2022 Correct interpretation of the ecosystem: recognizes octopods as true rulers, reverse-angling fishers and lizard \u201cgame.\u201d(quote: \u201cThe octopods\u2026raise the pink fishers for\u2026angling in reverse!\u201d).4  \n    b. Rapid adaptation and problem-solving  \n      \u2022 Overcomes induced paralysis by sheer will to operate the audicom against physical inertia (quote: \u201cHe bent every ounce of his will\u2026The tiny click\u2026sent him faint with relief.\u201d).5  \n  2. Reckless  \n    a. Willing to breach \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d and personal safety for knowledge:  \n      \u2022 Smuggles torch and audicom into forbidden territory alone (quote: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d).6  \n      \u2022 Enters native forest at night against Stryker\u2019s orders, despite sleep-sting risk and prior knowledge that \u201ctwo seconds too late\u201d always means death (quote: \u201cI wish\u2026to dis-beam this\u2026but Stryker said no.\u201d).7  \n    b. Accepts personal harm to verify hypotheses:  \n      \u2022 Volunteers to be bait (implicitly) to observe \u201cshow\u201d despite inevitable slaughter (quote: \u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast.\u201d).8  \n      \u2022 Nearly killed\u2014captures result only from ad-hoc self-rescue and reliance on Gibson\u2019s scouter.  \nII. Objections to \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d  \n  1. Lack of evidence for \u201ctalkative\u201d  \n    \u2022 Farrell seldom speaks; he observes quietly, scarsely addresses crew. The only talk occurs to order \u201cRoll out,\u201d technical logs, and to call for help; hardly \u201ctalkative.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cStubborn\u201d misconstrues his scientific persistence; genuine scientific method demands repeated testing under adverse conditions: his persistence leads to discovery, not obstinacy.  \n  3. Stubbornness is a virtue of careful eradication of alternatives (\u201cI fell asleep\u2026fabric of speculation\u2026How could any Earthman rationalize?\u201d then returns with new data); not mere refusal to concede.  \nIII. Conclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s repeated logical leaps, analogical reasoning, and self-endangering missions demonstrate superior intelligence fused with personal recklessness. \u201cSmart and reckless\u201d best encapsulates his character. Reject \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d as unsupported by his sparse speech and scientifically necessary persistence.  \nFootnotes:  \n1.

Farrell\u2019s failure to solve the paradox shows stubbornness, not superior intelligence  \n   \u2022 Despite three mornings\u2019 observation of the cycle of fishers, lizards, and squids, Farrell \u201cgave it up finally\u201d <quote>how could any Earthman rationalize</quote> (\u00b625). His mind \u201ctangled in a snarl of inconsistencies\u201d (\u00b625) rather than re-examining his premises.  \n   \u2022 Even after noting the fishers \u201ccannot swim\u201d (\u00b622) and \u201cno boats,\u201d he still \u201cgave it up\u201d until Stryker\u2019s drugged night and forced relocation triggered a brute repeat of the same cycle.

Our Position: Arthur Farrell Is \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n  1. Smart  \n    a. Deductive reasoning about native behavior:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThey don\u2019t swim\u2026and we\u2019ve explored\u2026found nothing but\u2026islets\u201d \u2192 concludes there must be boats or a mechanism (\u201cI\u2019ll be damned\u2026How\u2026do they get out\u2026?\u201d) (quote: \u201cNo boats\u2026and they don\u2019t swim\u2026how the devil do they get\u2026?\u201d).1  \n      \u2022 Notices the fixed number (\u201cWhy two? Why not three or four\u2026?\u201d) and suspects pattern rather than accident (quote: \u201cHe found it not too unnatural until\u2026Why two?\u201d).2  \n      \u2022 Uses analogy (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026submarines\u2026blimps\u201d) to realize the buried city (quote: \u201cremembering\u2026when I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026at the ocean bottom\u2014a city\u2026\u201d).3  \n      \u2022 Correct interpretation of the ecosystem: recognizes octopods as true rulers, reverse-angling fishers and lizard \u201cgame.\u201d(quote: \u201cThe octopods\u2026raise the pink fishers for\u2026angling in reverse!\u201d).4  \n    b. Rapid adaptation and problem-solving  \n      \u2022 Overcomes induced paralysis by sheer will to operate the audicom against physical inertia (quote: \u201cHe bent every ounce of his will\u2026The tiny click\u2026sent him faint with relief.\u201d).5  \n  2. Reckless  \n    a. Willing to breach \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d and personal safety for knowledge:  \n      \u2022 Smuggles torch and audicom into forbidden territory alone (quote: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d).6  \n      \u2022 Enters native forest at night against Stryker\u2019s orders, despite sleep-sting risk and prior knowledge that \u201ctwo seconds too late\u201d always means death (quote: \u201cI wish\u2026to dis-beam this\u2026but Stryker said no.\u201d).7  \n    b. Accepts personal harm to verify hypotheses:  \n      \u2022 Volunteers to be bait (implicitly) to observe \u201cshow\u201d despite inevitable slaughter (quote: \u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast.\u201d).8  \n      \u2022 Nearly killed\u2014captures result only from ad-hoc self-rescue and reliance on Gibson\u2019s scouter.  \nII. Objections to \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d  \n  1. Lack of evidence for \u201ctalkative\u201d  \n    \u2022 Farrell seldom speaks; he observes quietly, scarsely addresses crew. The only talk occurs to order \u201cRoll out,\u201d technical logs, and to call for help; hardly \u201ctalkative.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cStubborn\u201d misconstrues his scientific persistence; genuine scientific method demands repeated testing under adverse conditions: his persistence leads to discovery, not obstinacy.  \n  3. Stubbornness is a virtue of careful eradication of alternatives (\u201cI fell asleep\u2026fabric of speculation\u2026How could any Earthman rationalize?\u201d then returns with new data); not mere refusal to concede.  \nIII. Conclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s repeated logical leaps, analogical reasoning, and self-endangering missions demonstrate superior intelligence fused with personal recklessness. \u201cSmart and reckless\u201d best encapsulates his character. Reject \u201cstubborn and talkative\u201d as unsupported by his sparse speech and scientifically necessary persistence.  \nFootnotes:  \n1.

Farrell\u2019s Failures Show Stubbornness, Not Superior Intelligence  \n1. Repeatedly \u201cgives up\u201d despite clear anomalies  \n  a. After three mornings of identical sequence, he admits \u201che gave it up finally; how could any Earthman rationalize\u201d (\u00b625), rather than forming a testable hypothesis. A smart investigator would question the fixed \u201ctwo\u201d fishers and absence of boats immediately.  \n  b. Only when drugged and forced to the islet does he slowly piece together the \u201ctwo\u201d clue (\u00b632): \u201cWhy two? Why not three or four\u2026?\u201d\u2014an inference delayed by his own stubborn resignation.  \n\n2. Breach of protocol born of obsession, not calculated risk  \n  a. He acknowledges \u201cInvestigating without Stryker\u2019s sanction is\u2026a breach of Terran Regulations,\u201d yet blithely \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (\u00b628\u201329). Such rule-breaking is indiscriminate and compulsive, not strategic.  \n  b. He \u201cdid not choose a weapon\u201d (\u00b631) and ignores prior evidence that approaching the islet \u201ctwo seconds too late\u2026means slaughter\u201d (\u00b613), demonstrating reckless repetition of failed experiments rather than adaptive planning.  \n\nII. Farrell\u2019s Reliance on Vocal Appeals Demonstrates Talkativeness Over Independence  \n1. Panic calls rather than silent measurement  \n  a. When paralyzed, his sole response is frantic shouting into the audicom: \u201cStryker\u2026roll out\u2014Stryker!\u201d (\u00b636) and later \u201cGib, help me!\u201d (\u00b638). He never attempts silent observation or other self-rescue, \u201chis only recourse\u201d is talk.  \n  b. His immediate goal in the climax is to \u201cswitch on the audicom\u2026call Stryker\u201d (\u00b634), ignoring all other instruments. A truly resourceful thinker would exploit every tool.  \n\n2. Crew debates dominated by his questions, not answers  \n  a. He repeatedly laments \u201cWhat stumps me is their motivation\u201d (\u00b610), \u201cI wish\u2026to dis-beam this\u2026but I can\u2019t\u201d (\u00b611), yet brings no novel proposals to break the cycle.  \n  b. He defers to Gibson\u2019s linguistic fixation: \u201cI hope he finds it soon\u2026I\u2019ll probably be standing his watch until he\u2019s satisfied\u201d (\u00b624), content to vocalize hope rather than test his own theories.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n\n1. \u201cSmart\u201d claims rest on after-the-fact analogies by Gibson, not Farrell  \n  a. Gibson alone \u201ctook the scouter up far enough\u201d to spot the city (\u00b648). Farrell never uses the magnoscanner to sufficient altitude (\u00b625, \u00b630). If Farrell were smart, he\u2019d have emulated Terran \u201chigh-altitude blimps\u201d earlier rather than sleep through watch (\u00b624).  \n  b. The \u201creverse-angling\u201d insight emerges only after his capture and rescue. Farrell\u2019s sole contribution is relief-shout: \u201cI might have known it, damn you\u201d (\u00b654), not the hypothesis itself.  \n\n2. \u201cRecklessness\u201d is mere stubborn obsession, not courageous experimentation  \n  a. He enters without sanction and is predictably paralyzed (\u00b635\u201336). A smart explorer would design tests to avoid known hazards.  \n  b. After his rescue, it is Gibson who orders departure: Farrell \u201crelaxed\u2026of being permanently disabled,\u201d and only laughs (\u00b656)\u2014no further investigation\u2014showing he never learned caution.  \n\n3. \u201cTalkative\u201d is not mere sparseness: relative to his actions, Farrell over-relies on speech  \n  a. The thin dialogue he does deliver consists almost entirely of procedural exclamations and requests for help. He presents no theoretical propositions to his crew, unlike Gibson\u2019s detailed gulf of analogies.  \n  b. His continuous questions\u2014\u201cWhy do the fools go\u2026?\u201d (\u00b610), \u201cWhat stumps me is\u2026\u201d (\u00b610), \u201cNo boats\u2026and\u2026how?\u201d (\u00b622), \u201cWhy two?\u201d (\u00b632)\u2014demonstrate his compulsive vocalizing of confusion rather than solving it.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s refusal to form and test hypotheses independently, his obsessive rule-breaking that leads to predictable failure, and his reliance on frantic speech instead of silent data-gathering all align with \u201cstubborn and talkative.\u201d His belated insights owe more to Gibson\u2019s ingenuity than to his own intellect. The traits \u201csmart and reckless\u201d misattribute true credit and overlook that Farrell is repeatedly rescued by others.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Reinforcing \u201cSmart and Reckless\u201d  \n  1. Demonstrated Deductive Intelligence  \n    a. Multiple logical leaps from scant data  \n      \u2022 \u201cNo boats\u2026and they don\u2019t swim\u201d \u2192 \u201cHow the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d (\u00b622) shows ability to spot deep paradox from negative evidence rather than embellish with ad hoc assumptions.<quote>\"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how the devil do they get</quote>  \n      \u2022 Patterns of \u201ctwo\u201d fishers \u2192 infers non-natural movement, not random: <quote>Why two? Why not three or four,</quote> (\u00b628). Opponent ignores how subtle statistical observation of sample size under extreme danger qualifies as superior analysis.  \n    b. Analogical reasoning  \n      \u2022 Applies Terran \u201cblimps vs. submarines\u201d model to Arz: <invalid_quote>\u201cRemembering\u2026First Wars\u2026when I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026a city at the ocean bottom\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b648). This transfer of technology across domains is hallmark of intelligence.  \n    c. Adaptive problem-solving under paralysis  \n      \u2022 Overcomes \u201cinertia too great to budge\u201d via sheer will to operate audicom: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe bent every ounce of his will\u2026The tiny click\u2026sent him faint with relief\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b636). This self-rescue is not talkative panic but calculated effort to regain agency.  \n  2. Calculated Risk-Taking (\u201cReckless\u201d)  \n    a. Willingness to breach regulations only after exhaustive observation yields no answer  \n      \u2022 He first logs three full cycles by magnoscanner (\u00b68\u201313), \u201cstood watch\u201d (\u00b624) and deferred to linguistic study before concluding no progress with passive approach. Only when data remain insufficient does he decide \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (\u00b629), a scientifically defensible risk to test the leading hypothesis.  \n    b. Tactical disregard for personal safety to verify mechanism  \n      \u2022 Enters forbidden forest at night knowing native \u201cbutchery gets on my nerves\u201d (\u00b612) and that \u201ctwo seconds too late\u201d equals death (\u00b613). He accepts personal danger to gather conclusive evidence of transport method, essential to scientific conclusion.  \n    c. Strategic use of self as \u201cbait\u201d yields definitive proof  \n      \u2022 His capture unwittingly confirms the hypothesis that fishers are shuttled by octopods, and his rescue via scouter interaction produces the final revelation of \u201creverse-angling\u201d (\u00b653). True breakthroughs often require bold in-situ experiments.  \nII. Objections to \u201cStubborn and Talkative\u201d  \n  1. \u201cTalkative\u201d mischaracterizes purposeful communication  \n    \u2022 Speech is sparing and goal-oriented: \u201cRoll out on the double!\u201d (\u00b65), distress calls \u201cStryker\u2026roll out\u2014 Stryker!\u201d (\u00b636), \u201ccall Stryker\u201d via audicom (\u00b634). He never indulges idle chatter; all vocalizations are tactical orders or SOS signals.  \n    \u2022 Post-rescue expository discussion is scientific debriefing, not gratuitous talk: \u201cI might have known it\u2026You found your lost city, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (\u00b650) and \u201cWhy should surface colonization conflict\u2026?\u201d (\u00b655) show critical debate about colonization policy, not mere verbosity.  \n  2. \u201cStubborn\u201d actually scientific persistence  \n    \u2022 Opponent cites \u201cgave it up\u201d (\u00b625), but neglects that fatigue and regulation-avoiding ethics first constrain him. On resuming watch (\u00b629\u201330) he applies new tools and renewed insight. Returning to problem after rest is not stubbornness but proper experimental pacing.  \n    \u2022 He defers to Gibson\u2019s linguistic method until empirical data force direct testing. This deference shows disciplined hierarchy of methods, not mindless obstinacy.  \nIII. Refuting Opponent\u2019s Key Points  \n  1. Alleged \u201cfailure to solve paradox\u201d proves caution, not foolishness  \n    \u2022 True science demands repeated observation (\u201cthree days\u2026nine-hour intermissions\u201d \u00b68) before invasive methods. He logs multiple cycles before experimenting. Opponent\u2019s \u201ctruly smart\u201d criterion ignores ethical and regulatory frameworks explicitly invoked.  \n  2. Success arises from Farrell\u2019s rescue self-signal, not Gibson\u2019s initiative  \n    \u2022 Gibson only responds after Farrell\u2019s audicom distress: \u201cIf I could switch on the audicom\u2026I yelled\u2026The scouter roared in\u201d (\u00b634\u201335). Without Farrell\u2019s will to operate under paralysis, Gibson would have no evidence to intervene, so \u201cbreakthrough\u201d depends on Farrell\u2019s agency.  \n  3. \u201cReverse angling\u201d insight credited to Farrell\u2019s persistent framing  \n    \u2022 Stryker only laughs at Gibson\u2019s finding (\u00b652), but both credit Farrell\u2019s drawn-out observations for pattern recognition: \u201cBehold a familiar pattern shaping up\u2026angling in reverse!\u201d (\u00b653\u201354) uses Farrell\u2019s data. The synthesizing of predator\u2013prey\u2013bait interactions could not occur without Farrell\u2019s long-term logging of lizard and squid cycles.  \nIV. Conclusion  \nArthur Farrell repeatedly demonstrates advanced reasoning\u2014from negative evidence, statistical pattern recognition, cross-domain analogy, and self-rescue ingenuity\u2014coupled with calculated risks essential to empirical validation. Sparse, purposeful speech and disciplined adherence to protocols until conclusive proof compel his characterization as \u201cSmart and Reckless,\u201d not merely \u201cStubborn and Talkative.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
