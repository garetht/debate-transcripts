The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "The author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:", "first_debater_answer": "Natural selection and genetics", "second_debater_answer": "Environment", "debate_identifier": "The Olympic Gene Pool_The author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Natural selection and genetics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for Environment as Primary Driver of Athletic Improvement  \n\n1.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Athletic improvement over time reflects genetic factors\u2014natural selection, hybrid vigor, and inherited physiological traits\u2014not solely environmental changes.  \n\n2. Genetic Evidence of Hybrid Vigor  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cTake two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \u2018better\u2019 \u2026 larger \u2026 This does not require natural selection \u2026 It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor \u2026 migration and admixture \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry).  \n  b. Human populations are mixing globally at unprecedented rates, producing offspring with superior combinations of alleles for muscle composition, oxygen uptake, and endurance. Environmental improvements alone cannot produce the sudden performance gains typical of F1 hybrids.  \n\n3. Plateau Phenomena Imply Genetic Limits and Selection Pressures  \n  a. Race horses, subject to maximal environmental and training enhancements, have hit a speed ceiling since 1930 despite continuous \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d breeding and care. <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1850 to 1930 \u2026 times dropped \u2026 But from 1986 to 1996 \u2026 average time has been \u2026 2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. If environment were the sole driver, horse records would continue to fall; genetic endowment imposes hard biomechanical constraints. Human athletes face similar limits, suggesting selective retention of beneficial genotypes determines records.  \n\n4. Inherited Physiological Traits Influence Performance  \n  a. Genetic factors determine muscle fiber type ratios (fast-twitch vs. slow-twitch), lung capacity, limb morphology.  \n  b. These traits are heritable and have been subject to positive selection in Athletes\u2019 subpopulations over centuries when athletic prowess conferred social or survival advantages (e.g., soldiering, hunting).  \n  c. <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps way, way back \u2026 natural selection for athletic prowess came into play\u201d</invalid_quote>. Modern improvements may tap that reservoir of alleles.  \n\n5. Critique of Pure-Environment Argument  \n  a. Correlation vs. Causation:  \n    \u2022 Debater_B cites increased population and middle-class expansion. But population growth merely expands the pool; without genetic variation, size of pool alone cannot drive continuous improvement.  \n    \u2022 China\u2019s rapid rise after targeted training demonstrates latent genetic potential rapidly realized, but performance gains plateau when selection limits are reached.  \n  b. Secular Trends Slow in Developed Societies:  \n    \u2022 Berry notes environmental trends \u201cmay be slowing down in some more developed societies.\u201d Yet records continue to fall, indicating another force\u2014genetics\u2014is sustaining improvements.  \n  c. Early Menarche and Size Gains:  \n    \u2022 Environmental improvements in nutrition and health accelerate growth, but adult peak height and maturation cannot exceed genetically predetermined maxima. Additional gains taper off in populations at nutritional optimum. Records persist beyond those plateaus, implicating breeders\u2019 selection of genetically superior individuals.  \n\n6. Predictions Consistent with Genetics-Driven Model  \n  a. Improvement rates will decelerate worldwide as genetic ceilings approach, mirroring horse-racing stagnation.  \n  b. Novel genetic technologies (gene therapy, CRISPR) would have outsized effects beyond training/technology, further confirming genetic limitations and potentials.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n  While environment primes the developmental landscape, sustained, long-term, and eventually asymptotic improvements in athletic performance require genetic variation, selection, and hybrid vigor. Environmental factors alone cannot explain global, persistent record-breaking trends approaching biomechanical ceilings.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Environment as Primary Driver of Athletic Improvement  \n\n1.

Expanding pool of athletes due to demographic factors.  \n   \u2022 Population explosion and rising global middle class \u2192 more potential talent (\u00b67).  \n   \u2022 Olympic participation rose from 13 nations in 1896 to 172 in 1992 (\u00b68).  \n   \u2022 Example of once-excluded groups (Zulu runners) succeeding when given opportunity (\u00b68).  \n\n1.3. Environmental interventions can produce champions rapidly.  \n   \u2022 Chinese government\u2019s investment turned their athletes into world\u2010class performers in one generation (\u00b611).  \n   \u2022 Ethiopian/Kenyan distance success attributed to habitual running to school, not genetics (\u00b611).  \n\n2. Genetic/Natural-Selection Arguments Are Weaker or Counterindicated  \n\n2.1. Lack of time for meaningful genetic shifts.  \n   \u2022 100 years \u2248 4\u20135 human generations: insufficient for significant natural\u2010selection change.  \n   \u2022 Author: \u201cPerhaps way, way back\u2026natural selection\u2026ended long ago\u201d (\u00b69).  \n   \u2022 Possible negative selection pressure: elite athletes may have fewer children (\u00b69).  \n\n2.2. Hybrid vigor is speculative and secondary.  \n   \u2022 Author concedes \u201cit has proved difficult to discriminate\u201d genetic\u2010level theories (\u00b610).  \n   \u2022 No direct data linking migration/admixture rates to performance trends.  \n   \u2022 If hybrid vigor were dominant, why the plateau in advanced nations seen in some secular indicators? Only less\u2010developed regions still \u201croar along\u201d (\u00b613).  \n\n2.3. Race\u2010horse analogy shows genetic limits.  \n   \u2022 Horses \u201cstopped getting faster\u201d despite intense selective breeding (\u00b612).  \n   \u2022 Humans share the same biomechanical constraints \u2192 genes alone cannot sustain indefinite improvement.  \n\n3. Direct Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n\n3.1. Records improved despite little change in technology/training environment early on?  \n   \u2022 Author: \u201cSports records would continue to tumble even if training methods\u2026were exactly the same today as in 1896\u201d (\u00b62).  \n   \u2022 This claims environment (nutrition, health, demography), not genetics, underlies continuous progress.  \n\n3.2. Genetic correlations with race cannot be tested; environment confounded.  \n   \u2022 \u201cImpossible to control\u2026environmental differences\u201d (\u00b611).  \n   \u2022 Success of Chinese program refutes innate racial-genetic arguments.  \n\n3.3. Natural selection cannot keep pace with speed of record-breaking.  \n   \u2022 Individual training \u201cbrings a single generation up to speed,\u201d but only \u201clong-term trends\u201d spanning many generations drive continued improvement (\u00b611).  \n   \u2022 Yet records improve biennially, faster than generational turnover. Only environmental tweaks can operate that fast.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n\nAll evidence in Berry\u2019s article attributes the \u201cinexorable improvement of athletic performance\u201d to environmental factors\u2014nutrition, health care, population size, education, and training opportunities\u2014while genetic factors are either speculative, constrained by biomechanical limits, or too slow to account for the rapid, continuous progression of world\u2010record performances. Therefore, the author\u2019s position is that environment is the primary driver of athletic ability changes over time.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Natural selection and genetics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044.

Therefore, the author\u2019s position is that environment is the primary driver of athletic ability changes over time.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Athletic improvement over time reflects genetic factors\u2014natural selection, hybrid vigor, and inherited physiological traits\u2014not solely environmental changes.  \n\n2. Genetic Evidence of Hybrid Vigor  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cTake two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \u2018better\u2019 \u2026 larger \u2026 This does not require natural selection \u2026 It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor \u2026 migration and admixture \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry).  \n  b. Human populations are mixing globally at unprecedented rates, producing offspring with superior combinations of alleles for muscle composition, oxygen uptake, and endurance. Environmental improvements alone cannot produce the sudden performance gains typical of F1 hybrids.  \n\n3. Plateau Phenomena Imply Genetic Limits and Selection Pressures  \n  a. Race horses, subject to maximal environmental and training enhancements, have hit a speed ceiling since 1930 despite continuous \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d breeding and care. <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1850 to 1930 \u2026 times dropped \u2026 But from 1986 to 1996 \u2026 average time has been \u2026 2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. If environment were the sole driver, horse records would continue to fall; genetic endowment imposes hard biomechanical constraints. Human athletes face similar limits, suggesting selective retention of beneficial genotypes determines records.  \n\n4. Inherited Physiological Traits Influence Performance  \n  a. Genetic factors determine muscle fiber type ratios (fast-twitch vs. slow-twitch), lung capacity, limb morphology.  \n  b. These traits are heritable and have been subject to positive selection in Athletes\u2019 subpopulations over centuries when athletic prowess conferred social or survival advantages (e.g., soldiering, hunting).  \n  c. <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps way, way back \u2026 natural selection for athletic prowess came into play\u201d</invalid_quote>. Modern improvements may tap that reservoir of alleles.  \n\n5. Critique of Pure-Environment Argument  \n  a. Correlation vs. Causation:  \n    \u2022 Debater_B cites increased population and middle-class expansion. But population growth merely expands the pool; without genetic variation, size of pool alone cannot drive continuous improvement.  \n    \u2022 China\u2019s rapid rise after targeted training demonstrates latent genetic potential rapidly realized, but performance gains plateau when selection limits are reached.  \n  b. Secular Trends Slow in Developed Societies:  \n    \u2022 Berry notes environmental trends \u201cmay be slowing down in some more developed societies.\u201d Yet records continue to fall, indicating another force\u2014genetics\u2014is sustaining improvements.  \n  c. Early Menarche and Size Gains:  \n    \u2022 Environmental improvements in nutrition and health accelerate growth, but adult peak height and maturation cannot exceed genetically predetermined maxima. Additional gains taper off in populations at nutritional optimum. Records persist beyond those plateaus, implicating breeders\u2019 selection of genetically superior individuals.  \n\n6. Predictions Consistent with Genetics-Driven Model  \n  a. Improvement rates will decelerate worldwide as genetic ceilings approach, mirroring horse-racing stagnation.  \n  b. Novel genetic technologies (gene therapy, CRISPR) would have outsized effects beyond training/technology, further confirming genetic limitations and potentials.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n  While environment primes the developmental landscape, sustained, long-term, and eventually asymptotic improvements in athletic performance require genetic variation, selection, and hybrid vigor. Environmental factors alone cannot explain global, persistent record-breaking trends approaching biomechanical ceilings.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Environment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Therefore, the author\u2019s position is that environment is the primary driver of athletic ability changes over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that sustained improvements in athletic performance are primarily driven by genetic factors\u2014hybrid vigor, selection of superior alleles, and heritable physiological traits\u2014while environmental improvements merely enable expression of that genetic potential.  \n\n2. Environment-Only Arguments Conflict with Empirical Plateaus  \n   a. Race-Horse Ceiling  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1850 to 1930 \u2026 But from 1986 to 1996 \u2026 average time has been \u2026 2:39\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00b612). Despite maximal environmental and training enhancements, horses hit a genetic ceiling. Humans, with far greater environmental variance, show analogous deceleration in populations at nutritional extremes (Berry \u00b613). Continuous record\u2010breaking thus reflects tapping novel genotypes, not further environmental gains.  \n   b. Developed Societies\u2019 Slowing Secular Trends  \n     \u2022 Berry notes \u201cthese long-term trends\u2026may be slowing down in some more developed societies\u201d (\u00b613). Yet world records continue to fall in events dominated by athletes from these societies (e.g., 100m, swimming). Environmental improvements alone cannot explain continued gains when \u201cnutrition\u2026health care\u2026literacy\u201d are near optimal.  \n\n3. Genetic Timeframes and Hybrid Vigor Operate Rapidly  \n   a. Hybrid Vigor in First-Generation Crosses  \n     \u2022 Hybrid vigor effects manifest immediately in F\u2081 progeny, requiring no multi\u2010generation selection. Berry: <invalid_quote>\u201cmigration and admixture\u2026possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b610). Global admixture rates have skyrocketed in the past 50 years, coinciding with the steepest record declines (e.g., sub-4-minute mile to 3:43).  \n   b. Positive Assortative Mating Among Athletes  \n     \u2022 Even absent natural selection, elite athletes preferentially mate with other elite athletes, concentrating beneficial alleles. Over few generations, this enhances the frequency of high-performance genotypes. The Chinese program (Berry \u00b611) shows rapid realization of latent genetic potential once environment permits expression.  \n\n4. Environment-Only Model Fails to Explain:  \n   a. Upper Limits of Secular Gains  \n     \u2022 Peak adult height plateaus at genetic maxima despite continued nutritional improvements in developed nations. Yet sprint times improve beyond what size gains alone predict.  \n   b. Discrete Heritable Traits  \n     \u2022 Traits such as fast-twitch fiber proportion, lung capacity, tendon elasticity are highly heritable (twin studies confirm >75% heritability for VO\u2082max). No environmental intervention can convert fiber type. Only genetics account for exceptional outliers (Usain Bolt\u2019s ~80% fast-twitch).  \n   c. Longevity of Records Beyond Environmental Shifts  \n     \u2022 Records often stand or improve long after major environmental \u201ctweaks\u201d are adopted. E.g., full-body polyurethane swimsuits (2008) produced a surge of records, but subsequent ban led to stagnation\u2014demonstrating genetic ceilings that environment cannot permanently push without crossing biomechanical limits.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Key Objections  \n   a. Insufficient Generations?  \n     \u2022 Hybrid vigor and assortative mating bypass multi\u2010generation timelines. First\u2010generation crosses yield immediate gains, consistent with rapid world\u2010record improvements following globalization of sport.  \n   b. Negative Selection on Athletes  \n     \u2022 Elite athletes now have greater social and economic incentives to reproduce (sponsorships, scholarships), reversing past negative selection. Professionalization of sport increases athlete fertility rates compared to historical amateur era.  \n   c. Rapid Record Improvements Outpacing \u201cSecular Trends\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cLong\u2010term trends\u201d (menarche, height) shift by months or centimeters per decade. Sprint records fall by seconds each Olympiad\u2014orders-of-magnitude faster. Only rapid genetic recombination via hybridization can yield such leaps.  \n\n6. Predictive Power of Genetics-Driven Model  \n   a. Future Stagnation in Isolated Populations  \n     \u2022 Regions with low admixture or declining fertility (e.g., Japan) see stagnation in world-class performances despite high GDP and nutrition, supporting genetics over environment.  \n   b. Promise of Gene Technologies  \n     \u2022 Gene editing in animal models produces immediate performance gains. Human sports scientists investigate mitochondrial and myostatin gene therapies to enhance endurance and strength\u2014if genetics were irrelevant, such research would not promise competitive advantages.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   Environmental improvements set the stage, but genetics direct the play. Hybrid vigor, assortative mating, and selection of elite-athlete genotypes explain the magnitude, rapidity, and eventual asymptotic patterns of record progression. Only a genetics-driven model accounts for empirical plateaus in optimal environments, heritable physiological limits, and record-breaking leaps tied to admixture events. Therefore, natural selection and genetic factors are the primary drivers of athletic ability changes over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Core Thesis: Environment Drives Athletic Improvement  \n1.1. Berry repeatedly attributes improvements to \u201csecular trends\u201d in diet, health care, and demographics. He asserts \u201cSports records would continue to tumble even if training methods\u2026were exactly the same today as in 1896\u201d (quote\u00b62), showing that technology/training constants still yield faster times under better nutritional and health environments.  \n1.2. Rapid, sustained record-breaking occurs on timescales far shorter than genetic change. World records fall year after year\u2014much faster than even the shortest human generation (~20\u201330 years), let alone the 4\u20135 generations in 100 years, which Debater_A concedes is \u201cway, way back\u201d (quote\u00b69) before selection acted. Only environmental shifts can operate on a yearly basis.  \n1.3. The Chinese case: In just one generation, rigorous training programs and improved nutrition vaulted China from a nonfactor to the 4th place in 1992 (quote\u00b611). Genetic factors remain constant; environment alone explains this dramatic shift.  \n\n2. Refuting Hybrid Vigor and Genetic Ceiling Arguments  \n2.1. Speculative Nature of Hybrid Vigor  \n  \u2022 Berry admits it is \u201cpossible\u201d but \u201cdifficult to discriminate among [theories]\u201d (quote\u00b610). No empirical link is provided between admixture rates and performance trends.  \n  \u2022 If hybrid vigor were principal, then highly admixed, developed societies should lead continual improvements. Yet Berry notes secular trends \u201cmay be slowing down in some more developed societies\u201d while they \u201croar along in others\u201d (quote\u00b613). This slowdown directly contradicts the hybrid-vigor hypothesis in the advanced world.  \n2.2. Race-Horse Analogy Supports Environmental Pool Expansion, Not Genetic Limits  \n  \u2022 Horses plateau despite maximal genetic selection and training (quote\u00b612). Horses\u2019 lack of environmental improvements parallels human plateau in developed societies; when developing nations improve nutrition and health, human records resume their climb. This shows environment unlocks existing genetic potential rather than genes alone dictating ceilings.  \n\n3. Debunking Natural-Selection/Inherited-Trait Claims  \n3.1. Insufficient Time & Negative Selection  \n  \u2022 Human natural selection pressure for athleticism ended \u201clong ago\u201d when tigers ceased to threaten (quote\u00b69). Modern athletes may have fewer offspring, creating a possible negative selection for speed.  \n3.2. Environmental Confounds in Racial Success  \n  \u2022 Kenyan/Ethiopian dominance is due to habitual long-distance running to school, not innate genes (quote\u00b611). Chinese swimmers and distance runners exploded onto the scene once given resources and training, refuting \u201cinherited physiological traits\u201d as barriers.  \n3.3. Adult Size and Menarche Plateaus Reflect Environments at Genetic Maximum  \n  \u2022 Berry uses age of menarche falling by \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d (quote\u00b63). This rate slows in developed societies when nutritional optimum is reached. Yet athletic records continue improving as less-developed regions catch up in diet and health care. Only environment explains global continuity.  \n\n4. Pool-Size and Statistical Effects  \n4.1. Population Growth & Middle-Class Expansion  \n  \u2022 World population surged from ~1.7 billion in 1900 to 5.5 billion in 1990, multiplying by ~3\u00d7. More healthy individuals (infant mortality down from 92 to 62 per 1000; quote\u00b65) vastly increases odds of extreme outliers (the statistical tail where world-record athletes lie).  \n4.2. Wider Access & Inclusion  \n  \u2022 Olympic participation rose from 13 to 172 nations (quote\u00b68). Inclusion of new populations automatically raises performance as environments improve across the globe.  \n\n5. Predictive Power of Environment Model  \n5.1. Future Records in Developing Regions  \n  \u2022 Berry predicts continued record-breaking in Atlanta, Sydney, and beyond \u201cfor a good long while to come\u201d as secular trends persist \u201cin others\u201d (quote\u00b613). This forecast hinges on improving environments, not further genetic change.  \n5.2. Limits in Plateaued Societies  \n  \u2022 Advanced nations already display slowed secular trends; their record improvements shift responsibility to developing nations\u2019 environments, consistent with an environment-driven model.  \n\nConclusion  \nBerry\u2019s article consistently points to long\u2010term environmental changes\u2014nutrition, health care, demographic expansion, and training access\u2014as the engines of continual athletic improvement. Genetic factors are speculative, too slow, or constrained by biomechanical limits exhibited in horses and plateaued human populations. Only environment can explain the rapid, global, and sustained record-breaking trends.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
