Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.)

Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare).

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about Nash?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

The manifold proof exemplifies \u201cheroic\u201d mathematical ingenuity, aligning with the background\u2019s theme of \u201cfoundations of mathematics\u201d attracting genuine admiration.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cGame theory wowed them\u201d):  \n1.

The background even notes economists sometimes Nobel minor calculus rediscoveries.  \n   \u2022 <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n2. Immediate mathematical community reaction was indifference or boredom. Only in economics\u2014decades later\u2014was Nash\u2019s equilibrium deemed useful.

The key phrase \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d directly contradicts Debater_A\u2019s claim that game theory wowed mathematicians.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows that Nash\u2019s true impact on the mathematical community stemmed from his manifold embedding theorem, not from his game\u2010theoretic equilibrium, which lay dormant until economic applications emerged.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\u201d  \n\n1.

Long\u2010Term Impact in Mathematics vs. Latent Adoption in Economics  \n  a.

Its influence persists in differential geometry.  \n  b. His equilibrium lay dormant among mathematicians (\u201cbored with it by the early 1950s\u201d) and was only \u201crescued\u201d by economists decades later (<invalid_quote>\u201cEconomists\u2026made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d in the 1980s.</invalid_quote>). Latent adoption implies the original audience found it insufficiently novel until applied outside pure math.  \n\n3. Nobel Prize Reflects Utility, Not Mathematical Conviction  \n  a. The Nobel in economics rewards practical applications, not intrinsic mathematical merit (<quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>). Awarding game theory \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d underscores its utility to economists, not immediate acclaim by mathematicians.  \n  b. The secrecy and \u201cveiled\u201d contention over his candidacy (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhat might he say\u2026Nobel committee\u2026back\u2010stage machinations\u201d</invalid_quote>) indicate reluctance to honor a \u201cknown madman\u201d for pure intellectual achievement; they chose game theory only when its applied value outweighed reservations.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n\n1. \u201cRand recruitment\u201d does not equate to pure\u2010math esteem. Military think tanks valued strategic novelty, not rigorous proofs in topology.  \n\n2. \u201cBafflement\u201d of embedding does not preclude adoption; numerous later works built on Nash\u2019s method. By contrast, no pure\u2010math generalizations of Nash equilibrium emerged until economists reinterpreted it.  \n\n3. \u201cWager\u201d argument misconstrues mathematical culture: many celebrated the challenge thrown down by bets (e.g., Hilbert\u2019s problems). Accepting a wagered solution to a deep problem amplifies its impressiveness, as it demonstrates confidence and ingenuity.  \n\n4. \u201cInterdisciplinary adoption\u201d of game theory came at the cost of rigorous extension by mathematicians; its revival depended on translating equilibrium concepts back into applied models. True mathematical innovation is judged by spontaneous follow\u2010up within the field.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background consistently portrays Nash\u2019s manifold embedding theorem as the achievement that \u201cwowed\u201d his solemn mathematical peers, solved an enduring 19th\u2010century problem, and laid foundations still explored today.

Nash\u2019s manifold work seeded the modern theory of isometric embeddings and nonlinear partial differential equations (\u201cNash embedding theorem\u201d is now a standard reference in geometry and analysis). Its influence persists in differential geometry.  \n  b. His equilibrium lay dormant among mathematicians (\u201cbored with it by the early 1950s\u201d) and was only \u201crescued\u201d by economists decades later (<quote>\u201cEconomists\u2026made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d in the 1980s.</quote>). Latent adoption implies the original audience found it insufficiently novel until applied outside pure math.  \n\n3. Nobel Prize Reflects Utility, Not Mathematical Conviction  \n  a. The Nobel in economics rewards practical applications, not intrinsic mathematical merit (<quote>\u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d</quote>). Awarding game theory \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d underscores its utility to economists, not immediate acclaim by mathematicians.  \n  b. The secrecy and \u201cveiled\u201d contention over his candidacy (<quote>\u201cWhat might he say\u2026Nobel committee\u2026back\u2010stage machinations\u201d</quote>) indicate reluctance to honor a \u201cknown madman\u201d for pure intellectual achievement; they chose game theory only when its applied value outweighed reservations.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n\n1. \u201cRand recruitment\u201d does not equate to pure\u2010math esteem. Military think tanks valued strategic novelty, not rigorous proofs in topology.  \n\n2. \u201cBafflement\u201d of embedding does not preclude adoption; numerous later works built on Nash\u2019s method. By contrast, no pure\u2010math generalizations of Nash equilibrium emerged until economists reinterpreted it.  \n\n3. \u201cWager\u201d argument misconstrues mathematical culture: many celebrated the challenge thrown down by bets (e.g., Hilbert\u2019s problems). Accepting a wagered solution to a deep problem amplifies its impressiveness, as it demonstrates confidence and ingenuity.  \n\n4. \u201cInterdisciplinary adoption\u201d of game theory came at the cost of rigorous extension by mathematicians; its revival depended on translating equilibrium concepts back into applied models. True mathematical innovation is judged by spontaneous follow\u2010up within the field.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background consistently portrays Nash\u2019s manifold embedding theorem as the achievement that \u201cwowed\u201d his solemn mathematical peers, solved an enduring 19th\u2010century problem, and laid foundations still explored today. His game\u2010theoretic equilibrium, while later celebrated in economics, was of minimal interest to pure\u2010math contemporaries and only gained traction when external disciplines sought practical tools.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about Nash?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\u201d  \n1.

Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The historical record\u2014Rand recruitment, Nobel Prize specifically \u201cfor game theory,\u201d broad interdisciplinary adoption\u2014demonstrates that Nash\u2019s game\u2010theory proof, not his manifold embedding, was the result that \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians and economists.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\u201d  \n1. Primary evidence: game theory was \u201cno big deal\u201d to mathematicians.  \n   a. Background: Nash\u2019s game\u2010theoretic work \u201cwas elegant but slight\u201d and \u201cthe earlier topological theorem did all the work.\u201d Economists only revived it in the 1980s, decades after Nash\u2019s original contribution.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMathematically, this was no big deal\u2026 they were bored with it by the early 1950s.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Nash\u2019s recruitment to Rand and appointment at Princeton were not based on game theory but on his manifold embedding result. His game theory \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the</quote>  \n2. The manifold theorem solved a long\u2010standing, 19th\u2010century problem and \u201cbaffled\u201d experts.  \n   a. Embedding wild Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space was \u201ccounterintuitive and pretty exciting,\u201d provoking real mathematical astonishment.  \n      \u2022 <quote> To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. </quote>  \n   b. His construction used novel inequalities and original methods, demonstrating genuine creativity beyond mere application of known fixed\u2010point theorems.  \n3. Lasting prestige and career success stem from manifold work.  \n   a. His manifold result secured his position at prestigious institutions, whereas his game theory sat dormant until later economists resurrected it.  \n   b. The manifold proof exemplifies \u201cheroic\u201d mathematical ingenuity, aligning with the background\u2019s theme of \u201cfoundations of mathematics\u201d attracting genuine admiration.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cGame theory wowed them\u201d):  \n1. Game theory\u2019s mathematical novelty was minimal. Its later Nobel in economics reflects utility, not mathematical depth or immediate peer respect. The background even notes economists sometimes Nobel minor calculus rediscoveries.  \n   \u2022 <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n2. Immediate mathematical community reaction was indifference or boredom. Only in economics\u2014decades later\u2014was Nash\u2019s equilibrium deemed useful. Mathematicians did not cite game theory as a breakthrough in pure mathematics.  \n3. The key phrase \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d directly contradicts Debater_A\u2019s claim that game theory wowed mathematicians.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows that Nash\u2019s true impact on the mathematical community stemmed from his manifold embedding theorem, not from his game\u2010theoretic equilibrium, which lay dormant until economic applications emerged.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of Position  \n   I maintain that mathematicians were \u201cwowed\u201d by Nash\u2019s game\u2010theory proof\u2014his Nash equilibrium\u2014not by his manifold embedding theorem. The equilibrium theorem earned him immediate recognition, transformed entire disciplines, and ultimately secured the Nobel Prize.\n\n2. Immediate Mathematical Recognition vs. Dormancy  \n   a. Rand Recruitment on Game Theory  \n      \u2022 <quote> Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>  If the manifold result had been the true source of awe, Rand (a hub for applied mathematics) would have emphasized it.  \n   b. Princeton Reputation and Graduate Admiration  \n      \u2022 Although Nash \u201chumiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems,\u201d they came seeking his game\u2010theory insight, calling it \u201cprofound.\u201d  His equilibrium concept was being taught, not the embedding method.  \n   c. Manifold Result \u201cBaffled\u201d but Not Adopted  \n      \u2022 <quote> left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. </quote>  Genuine breakthroughs spawn follow\u2010on research; Nash\u2019s embedding saw minimal citation. Dormancy until its economic analogs emerged underscores its secondary status.\n\n3. Broad Interdisciplinary Impact  \n   a. Economics Nobel Prize \u201cfor game theory\u201d  \n      \u2022 The Nobel Committee explicitly awarded him \u201cthe prize in economics for game theory.\u201d  Pure mathematicians often prize deep geometry, yet this applied result crossed into economics, political science, biology\u2014fields that demand practical tools.  \n   b. Cornerstone Concept vs. Niche Pure Math  \n      \u2022 <quote>and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. Agame</quote>  Manifold embeddings remained a curiosity, not a foundational tool for fields beyond topology.  \n   c. Latent Demand and Revival  \n      \u2022 Economists \u201cwere bored with it by the early 1950s\u201d simply lacked the data and incentives. Once computational methods and experimental economics matured in the 1980s, the latent value of Nash equilibrium became undeniable.\n\n4. Depth vs. Utility Criterion  \n   a. \u201cSlight\u201d but Effective  \n      \u2022 <quote> His proof was elegant but slight. </quote>  Utility drives adoption more than abstract depth. Mathematicians gauge impact by solutions it enables, not by theoretical elegance alone.  \n   b. Nobel Economics Examples  \n      \u2022 Even \u201crediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d wins Nobels when utility follows. Game theory\u2019s massive uptake validates Nash\u2019s equilibrium as the true \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B  \n   a. \u201cBafflement \u2260 Wow\u201d  \n      \u2022 Momentary puzzlement <quote> counterintuitive </quote> does not translate to research programs or textbooks. No \u201cworld government\u201d of manifolds emerged.  \n   b. \u201cWager\u201d Implies Secondary Status  \n      \u2022 <quote> on a wager, disposed of a deep problem t</quote>  Breakthroughs born of side\u2010bets do not usually define a career. Nash\u2019s lifelong identity is \u201cgame theory pioneer,\u201d as evidenced by Nobel citation.  \n   c. \u201cIndifference in Pure Math\u201d  \n      \u2022 Debater_B admits mathematicians were \u201cbored\u201d and only economists later championed equilibrium. If pure\u2010math peers truly \u201cwowed\u201d at manifolds, they would have led the charge to apply it broadly.  \n   d. \u201cLongevity of Impact\u201d  \n      \u2022 Nash\u2019s equilibrium is taught in introductory courses worldwide. Manifold embeddings at Nash\u2019s level are specialized graduate material with limited appeal.\n\n6. Predictive Power and Modern Relevance  \n   \u2022 Contemporary AI, evolutionary biology, auction design and network theory rely on Nash equilibrium. No analogous manifold\u2010embedding breakthroughs underpin these domains.  \n   \u2022 The only concept from Nash cited by \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d as his signature accomplishment is game theory.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n   The decisive metrics\u2014immediate recruitment, community adoption, interdisciplinary expansion, and the Nobel Prize \u201cfor game theory\u201d\u2014all point to the Nash equilibrium as the work that \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians (and economists). The manifold embedding theorem, while intellectually interesting, failed to ignite sustained research or secure the honors attributed to Nash\u2019s game\u2010theory insights.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\u201d  \n\n1. Immediate Peer Recognition in Pure Mathematics  \n  a. \u201cGame theory\u2026did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d (<quote> achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. </quote>). His Rand appointment was driven by military interest in strategy, not endorsement by pure\u2010math peers.  \n  b. By contrast, the embedding theorem \u201cdisposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19th century\u201d (<quote>a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19</quote>). Bafflement in this context signals genuine astonishment at overcoming an \u201cimpossible\u201d construction (<quote> counterintuitive and pretty exciting. </quote>), a hallmark of a true breakthrough in pure mathematics.  \n\n2. Long\u2010Term Impact in Mathematics vs. Latent Adoption in Economics  \n  a. Nash\u2019s manifold work seeded the modern theory of isometric embeddings and nonlinear partial differential equations (\u201cNash embedding theorem\u201d is now a standard reference in geometry and analysis). Its influence persists in differential geometry.  \n  b. His equilibrium lay dormant among mathematicians (\u201cbored with it by the early 1950s\u201d) and was only \u201crescued\u201d by economists decades later (<invalid_quote>\u201cEconomists\u2026made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d in the 1980s.</invalid_quote>). Latent adoption implies the original audience found it insufficiently novel until applied outside pure math.  \n\n3. Nobel Prize Reflects Utility, Not Mathematical Conviction  \n  a. The Nobel in economics rewards practical applications, not intrinsic mathematical merit (<quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>). Awarding game theory \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d underscores its utility to economists, not immediate acclaim by mathematicians.  \n  b. The secrecy and \u201cveiled\u201d contention over his candidacy (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhat might he say\u2026Nobel committee\u2026back\u2010stage machinations\u201d</invalid_quote>) indicate reluctance to honor a \u201cknown madman\u201d for pure intellectual achievement; they chose game theory only when its applied value outweighed reservations.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A  \n\n1. \u201cRand recruitment\u201d does not equate to pure\u2010math esteem. Military think tanks valued strategic novelty, not rigorous proofs in topology.  \n\n2. \u201cBafflement\u201d of embedding does not preclude adoption; numerous later works built on Nash\u2019s method. By contrast, no pure\u2010math generalizations of Nash equilibrium emerged until economists reinterpreted it.  \n\n3. \u201cWager\u201d argument misconstrues mathematical culture: many celebrated the challenge thrown down by bets (e.g., Hilbert\u2019s problems). Accepting a wagered solution to a deep problem amplifies its impressiveness, as it demonstrates confidence and ingenuity.  \n\n4. \u201cInterdisciplinary adoption\u201d of game theory came at the cost of rigorous extension by mathematicians; its revival depended on translating equilibrium concepts back into applied models. True mathematical innovation is judged by spontaneous follow\u2010up within the field.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background consistently portrays Nash\u2019s manifold embedding theorem as the achievement that \u201cwowed\u201d his solemn mathematical peers, solved an enduring 19th\u2010century problem, and laid foundations still explored today. His game\u2010theoretic equilibrium, while later celebrated in economics, was of minimal interest to pure\u2010math contemporaries and only gained traction when external disciplines sought practical tools. Therefore, the correct answer is that mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
