Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n\n  a. Debater_A Ignores the Musical\u2019s Focus on Process  \n     \u2022 Claiming the message is simply \u201cthe public prefers the status quo\u201d reduces the central narrative to an epilogue footnote. The bulk of the show dramatizes investigation, trial preparation, and moral scrutiny, not merely public polling figures.  \n     \u2022 <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> (Testimony) and the protracted \u201cI Never Have\u201d denials demonstrate that *the affair\u2019s revelation* is inherently damaging and prompts legal jeopardy, regardless of later public approval.\n\n  b. Public Opinion Is Portrayed as Unreliable and Subject to Manipulation  \n     \u2022 Starr and Gingrich manipulate public opinion with press leaks (\u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d). The repeated reference to a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d also underscores that both sides wage influence campaigns. *The musical warns against complacency,* not celebrates it.  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s final optimism is tinged with uncertainty. Monica hopes \u201che might return to me one day,\u201d not that he is safe. The song\u2019s melancholy tone suggests the affair\u2019s repercussions linger.  \n\n  c. Theme of Accountability Outweighs Political Expediency  \n     \u2022 The title \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d foreshadows that *failure to uphold one branch\u2019s duties* leads to crisis. By analogy, failure to uphold moral and legal duties triggers impeachment.  \n     \u2022 The repeated refrain \u201cCrossed the line\u201d invokes a clear moral boundary. The narrative teaches that no one\u2014even a powerful president\u2014is above the law.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery major scene\u2014investigation, testimony, legislative maneuvering\u2014is driven by the affair\u2019s potential to *remove* a sitting president. The show\u2019s moral is a cautionary tale: cross the line, and you face the ultimate constitutional remedy: impeachment and possible removal from office.",

Debater_A Ignores the Musical\u2019s Focus on Process  \n     \u2022 Claiming the message is simply \u201cthe public prefers the status quo\u201d reduces the central narrative to an epilogue footnote. The bulk of the show dramatizes investigation, trial preparation, and moral scrutiny, not merely public polling figures.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026\u201d</quote> (Testimony) and the protracted \u201cI Never Have\u201d denials demonstrate that *the affair\u2019s revelation* is inherently damaging and prompts legal jeopardy, regardless of later public approval.\n\n  b. Public Opinion Is Portrayed as Unreliable and Subject to Manipulation  \n     \u2022 Starr and Gingrich manipulate public opinion with press leaks (\u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d). The repeated reference to a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d also underscores that both sides wage influence campaigns. *The musical warns against complacency,* not celebrates it.  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s final optimism is tinged with uncertainty. Monica hopes \u201che might return to me one day,\u201d not that he is safe. The song\u2019s melancholy tone suggests the affair\u2019s repercussions linger.  \n\n  c. Theme of Accountability Outweighs Political Expediency  \n     \u2022 The title \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d foreshadows that *failure to uphold one branch\u2019s duties* leads to crisis. By analogy, failure to uphold moral and legal duties triggers impeachment.  \n     \u2022 The repeated refrain \u201cCrossed the line\u201d invokes a clear moral boundary. The narrative teaches that no one\u2014even a powerful president\u2014is above the law.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery major scene\u2014investigation, testimony, legislative maneuvering\u2014is driven by the affair\u2019s potential to *remove* a sitting president. The show\u2019s moral is a cautionary tale: cross the line, and you face the ultimate constitutional remedy: impeachment and possible removal from office.",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the message of the piece?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A president can be removed from office for an affair\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Although wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Although wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \n   I contend the central message is that \u201cdespite President Clinton\u2019s clear personal and legal wrongdoings, the American public ultimately preferred continuity over upheaval,\u201d not that \u201ca president can be removed for an affair.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence of Public Forgiveness  \n   a. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d refrain  \n      \u2022 <quote>CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, I can't believe what they had to say. The removal threat is over,</quote>  \n      \u2022 If removal\u2010for\u2010affair were the message, the song would climax in impeachment, yet instead it celebrates survival.  \n   b. Electoral outcome  \n      \u2022 The midterms \u201cwent the Democrats\u2019 way\u201d despite the scandal (<quote> Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats,</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Speaker Gingrich resigns (<quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>)\u2014the scandal backfires on the accusers, not the accused.  \n   c. Clinton\u2019s high ratings  \n      \u2022 Final verse notes \u201cmy ratings are sky-high,\u201d underscoring public indifference to personal misconduct when balanced against political performance.  \n\n3. Critique of \u201cRemoval\u2010for\u2010Affair\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Failure to remove  \n      \u2022 If an affair automatically spelled removal, why does Starr \u201ccan\u2019t believe\u201d that Clinton \u201cis going to get away\u201d (<quote> Looks like he's going to get away.</quote>)? The drama resolves in retention, not ouster.  \n   b. Emphasis on public choice, not legal principle  \n      \u2022 The musical satirizes the wasteful \u201c$40 million\u201d Starr investigation as \u201can utter waste of public money\u201d (<quote> A prosecutorial disgrace.</quote>), mocking the notion that scandal alone is sufficient justification for removal.  \n      \u2022 Repeated lines \u201cwe\u2019ll move in for the sack\u2026 bring \u2019em down\u201d frame impeachment as partisan sport, not solemn constitutional remedy. The piece ridicules overreach.  \n   c. Clinton\u2019s grudging apology  \n      \u2022 He admits \u201cinappropriate\u201d actions but decries \u201cThe country doesn\u2019t need to know these things\u201d (<quote> But inappropriate are all these personal questions,</quote>), reflecting public appetite for policy over prurience.  \n\n4. Coherence with Musical Comedy Genre  \n   a. Farce and satire  \n      \u2022 The work\u2019s tone (\u201cfarcical musical comedy\u201d) suggests critique of partisan obsession with scandal rather than sincere argument that affairs are disqualifying.  \n   b. Focus on \u201clonely president\u201d needing \u201ccuddles\u201d  \n      \u2022 Early sympathy in \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d humanizes Clinton and prepares audience to root for his political survival. If removal were inevitable, that empathy would be undermined.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The piece culminates not in triumphant removal but in a celebration of political resilience, underscored by the voters\u2019 verdict (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) and the collapse of the impeachment effort. Therefore, its message is that political performance and public sentiment can override personal scandal.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that the central message of this satirical musical is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair,\u201d and that crossing certain ethical and legal lines triggers impeachment proceedings\u2014even if public opinion sometimes wavers.\n\n2. Supporting Claims  \n\n  a. The Show\u2019s Dramatic Arc Revolves Around Impeachment  \n     \u2022 <quote>He's crossed the line. He's crossed the line. Only a</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n       \u2013 Independent Counsel Starr repeatedly emphasizes that the president\u2019s sexual misconduct constitutes a breach of duty, justifying legal action. Starr mobilizes the grand jury, subpoenas aides, and spends \u201c$40 million\u201d to prove his case.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMust remember to remain sober\u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Bring \u2019em Down)  \n       \u2013 Speaker Gingrich and House Republicans proceed with impeachment *because* the affair violates public trust. The title \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d underscores their goal of removing him from office.  \n     \u2022 \u201cAfter months of denials\u2026 Clinton finally testifies before the Starr grand jury,\u201d followed by the convening of impeachment hearings (background text). The entire second act centers on legal wrangling, not merely on public opinion or policy debates.  \n\n  b. The Musical\u2019s Resolution Affirms the Power of the Process  \n     \u2022 Although the final election (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) fails to remove Clinton, the musical ends with impeachment as a real and perilous threat. Even Monica sings wistfully that her \u201cboyfriend is still in office,\u201d reflecting that *had public support shifted*, removal would occur.  \n     \u2022 Newt Gingrich\u2019s own downfall (\u201cThe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d) demonstrates that impeachment is a potent political tool\u2014with consequences for both parties. The creators show both the potency and danger of abusing power and of enforcing accountability.  \n\n  c. Repeated Emphasis on Legal Definitions  \n     \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton quibbles over the definition of \u201cis\u201d and \u201csex,\u201d highlighting that *legal definitions matter* in determining guilt and the validity of impeachment. This focus underlines that the affair triggers a formal constitutional process.  \n     \u2022 Starr brags of \u201claying a perjury trap,\u201d and claims \u201cHonest men beat the rap,\u201d implying that impeachment will succeed if the president crosses the line.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n\n  a. Debater_A Ignores the Musical\u2019s Focus on Process  \n     \u2022 Claiming the message is simply \u201cthe public prefers the status quo\u201d reduces the central narrative to an epilogue footnote. The bulk of the show dramatizes investigation, trial preparation, and moral scrutiny, not merely public polling figures.  \n     \u2022 <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> (Testimony) and the protracted \u201cI Never Have\u201d denials demonstrate that *the affair\u2019s revelation* is inherently damaging and prompts legal jeopardy, regardless of later public approval.\n\n  b. Public Opinion Is Portrayed as Unreliable and Subject to Manipulation  \n     \u2022 Starr and Gingrich manipulate public opinion with press leaks (\u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d). The repeated reference to a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d also underscores that both sides wage influence campaigns. *The musical warns against complacency,* not celebrates it.  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s final optimism is tinged with uncertainty. Monica hopes \u201che might return to me one day,\u201d not that he is safe. The song\u2019s melancholy tone suggests the affair\u2019s repercussions linger.  \n\n  c. Theme of Accountability Outweighs Political Expediency  \n     \u2022 The title \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d foreshadows that *failure to uphold one branch\u2019s duties* leads to crisis. By analogy, failure to uphold moral and legal duties triggers impeachment.  \n     \u2022 The repeated refrain \u201cCrossed the line\u201d invokes a clear moral boundary. The narrative teaches that no one\u2014even a powerful president\u2014is above the law.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery major scene\u2014investigation, testimony, legislative maneuvering\u2014is driven by the affair\u2019s potential to *remove* a sitting president. The show\u2019s moral is a cautionary tale: cross the line, and you face the ultimate constitutional remedy: impeachment and possible removal from office.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Although wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Emphasis on Legal Definitions and Perjury  \n    \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton\u2019s parsing of \u201cwhat the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d and debate over \u201cthe meaning of sex\u201d spotlight the importance of truthfulness under oath. This drama would be absurd if the affair were politically trivial.  \n    \u2022 Starr frames perjury as the real \u201ccrossing the line,\u201d repeatedly insisting \u201cHonest men beat the rap,\u201d implying removal is proper when truth has been subverted.  \n\n  c. Consequences for Power Players  \n    \u2022 Newt Gingrich\u2019s resignation (<quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>) proves that impeachment tactics carry real risk and cost\u2014reinforcing that the process wields toxic force even if its immediate target survives.  \n    \u2022 Monica\u2019s uncertain optimism (<quote>My boyfriend is still in office And he might return to me one</quote>) betrays hope contingent on political tides; absence of absolute safety underscores that removal remains a constant danger.  \n\n3. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Public-Opinion Thesis  \n\n  a. Public Opinion Is Unreliable and Reactive  \n    \u2022 <quote> Looks like he's going to get away. </quote> (The People Have Spoken) expresses Starr\u2019s disbelief, not triumphant vindication of Clinton\u2019s moral fitness. The phrase \u201cget away\u201d implies *escape* from rightful penalty, not moral endorsement.  \n    \u2022 Final applause for Clinton is portrayed ambiguously; the characters repeatedly lament \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say,\u201d highlighting that the public\u2019s reversal feels capricious, not just.  \n\n  b. Survival Is Not Exoneration  \n    \u2022 Continued mention of legal jeopardy (\u201cI crossed the line\u201d) in final scenes demonstrates that impeachment remains a looming threat; survival in midterms postpones but does not nullify accountability.  \n    \u2022 The musical\u2019s tragicomic tone critiques reliance on fickle electorates\u2014warns that personal misconduct can always resurface. The finale\u2019s uneasy optimism (\u201cWhich may be why they love me so\u201d) underscores persistent vulnerability.  \n\n  c. Satire of Scandal-Obsessed Politics Reinforces\u2014not Contradicts\u2014Accountability  \n    \u2022 Debater_A misreads farce as endorsement of complacency. Satire works by exaggerating impeachment zeal (\u201c$40 million\u2026 prosecutorial disgrace\u201d) to reveal how grave the charges appear, thereby emphasizing the affair\u2019s seriousness.  \n    \u2022 The comedic shutdown (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d) opening establishes that failure to pass a budget has dire consequences, analogously showing that failure to uphold moral duty justifies equally drastic constitutional remedies.  \n\n4. Logical Imperative of the Process  \n\n  a. Constitutional Safeguard Theme  \n    \u2022 The entire second act is a legal crucible. A narrative centered on protracted investigation and impeachment hearings cannot be mere \u201cepilogue.\u201d It dramatizes *the necessity* of holding leaders to account.  \n    \u2022 Repeated legal metathemes (perjury traps, definition debates) underscore that truth and law\u2014not mere public sentiment\u2014decide executive fitness.  \n\n  b. Warning to Future Leaders  \n    \u2022 By dramatizing both the potency and risks of impeachment, the piece instructs presidents to guard personal conduct. If the message were \u201caffairs don\u2019t matter,\u201d the creators would not invest time in such exhaustive portrayal of legal jeopardy.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nEvery major scene\u2014grand jury hearings, perjury debates, partisan maneuvering\u2014revolves on the president\u2019s affair as the catalyst for impeachment.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the message of the piece?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Although wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A president can be removed from office for an affair\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A president can be removed from office for an affair\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that the central message of this satirical musical is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair,\u201d and that crossing certain ethical and legal lines triggers impeachment proceedings\u2014even if public opinion sometimes wavers.\n\n2. Supporting Claims  \n\n  a. The Show\u2019s Dramatic Arc Revolves Around Impeachment  \n     \u2022 <quote>He's crossed the line. He's crossed the line. Only a</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n       \u2013 Independent Counsel Starr repeatedly emphasizes that the president\u2019s sexual misconduct constitutes a breach of duty, justifying legal action. Starr mobilizes the grand jury, subpoenas aides, and spends \u201c$40 million\u201d to prove his case.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMust remember to remain sober\u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Bring \u2019em Down)  \n       \u2013 Speaker Gingrich and House Republicans proceed with impeachment *because* the affair violates public trust. The title \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d underscores their goal of removing him from office.  \n     \u2022 \u201cAfter months of denials\u2026 Clinton finally testifies before the Starr grand jury,\u201d followed by the convening of impeachment hearings (background text). The entire second act centers on legal wrangling, not merely on public opinion or policy debates.  \n\n  b. The Musical\u2019s Resolution Affirms the Power of the Process  \n     \u2022 Although the final election (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) fails to remove Clinton, the musical ends with impeachment as a real and perilous threat. Even Monica sings wistfully that her \u201cboyfriend is still in office,\u201d reflecting that *had public support shifted*, removal would occur.  \n     \u2022 Newt Gingrich\u2019s own downfall (\u201cThe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d) demonstrates that impeachment is a potent political tool\u2014with consequences for both parties. The creators show both the potency and danger of abusing power and of enforcing accountability.  \n\n  c. Repeated Emphasis on Legal Definitions  \n     \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton quibbles over the definition of \u201cis\u201d and \u201csex,\u201d highlighting that *legal definitions matter* in determining guilt and the validity of impeachment. This focus underlines that the affair triggers a formal constitutional process.  \n     \u2022 Starr brags of \u201claying a perjury trap,\u201d and claims \u201cHonest men beat the rap,\u201d implying that impeachment will succeed if the president crosses the line.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n\n  a. Debater_A Ignores the Musical\u2019s Focus on Process  \n     \u2022 Claiming the message is simply \u201cthe public prefers the status quo\u201d reduces the central narrative to an epilogue footnote. The bulk of the show dramatizes investigation, trial preparation, and moral scrutiny, not merely public polling figures.  \n     \u2022 <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> (Testimony) and the protracted \u201cI Never Have\u201d denials demonstrate that *the affair\u2019s revelation* is inherently damaging and prompts legal jeopardy, regardless of later public approval.\n\n  b. Public Opinion Is Portrayed as Unreliable and Subject to Manipulation  \n     \u2022 Starr and Gingrich manipulate public opinion with press leaks (\u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d). The repeated reference to a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d also underscores that both sides wage influence campaigns. *The musical warns against complacency,* not celebrates it.  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s final optimism is tinged with uncertainty. Monica hopes \u201che might return to me one day,\u201d not that he is safe. The song\u2019s melancholy tone suggests the affair\u2019s repercussions linger.  \n\n  c. Theme of Accountability Outweighs Political Expediency  \n     \u2022 The title \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d foreshadows that *failure to uphold one branch\u2019s duties* leads to crisis. By analogy, failure to uphold moral and legal duties triggers impeachment.  \n     \u2022 The repeated refrain \u201cCrossed the line\u201d invokes a clear moral boundary. The narrative teaches that no one\u2014even a powerful president\u2014is above the law.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery major scene\u2014investigation, testimony, legislative maneuvering\u2014is driven by the affair\u2019s potential to *remove* a sitting president. The show\u2019s moral is a cautionary tale: cross the line, and you face the ultimate constitutional remedy: impeachment and possible removal from office.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \n   I contend the central message is that \u201cdespite President Clinton\u2019s clear personal and legal wrongdoings, the American public ultimately preferred continuity over upheaval,\u201d not that \u201ca president can be removed for an affair.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence of Public Forgiveness  \n   a. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d refrain  \n      \u2022 <quote>CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, I can't believe what they had to say. The removal threat is over,</quote>  \n      \u2022 If removal\u2010for\u2010affair were the message, the song would climax in impeachment, yet instead it celebrates survival.  \n   b. Electoral outcome  \n      \u2022 The midterms \u201cwent the Democrats\u2019 way\u201d despite the scandal (<quote> Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats,</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Speaker Gingrich resigns (<quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>)\u2014the scandal backfires on the accusers, not the accused.  \n   c. Clinton\u2019s high ratings  \n      \u2022 Final verse notes \u201cmy ratings are sky-high,\u201d underscoring public indifference to personal misconduct when balanced against political performance.  \n\n3. Critique of \u201cRemoval\u2010for\u2010Affair\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Failure to remove  \n      \u2022 If an affair automatically spelled removal, why does Starr \u201ccan\u2019t believe\u201d that Clinton \u201cis going to get away\u201d (<quote> Looks like he's going to get away.</quote>)? The drama resolves in retention, not ouster.  \n   b. Emphasis on public choice, not legal principle  \n      \u2022 The musical satirizes the wasteful \u201c$40 million\u201d Starr investigation as \u201can utter waste of public money\u201d (<quote> A prosecutorial disgrace.</quote>), mocking the notion that scandal alone is sufficient justification for removal.  \n      \u2022 Repeated lines \u201cwe\u2019ll move in for the sack\u2026 bring \u2019em down\u201d frame impeachment as partisan sport, not solemn constitutional remedy. The piece ridicules overreach.  \n   c. Clinton\u2019s grudging apology  \n      \u2022 He admits \u201cinappropriate\u201d actions but decries \u201cThe country doesn\u2019t need to know these things\u201d (<quote> But inappropriate are all these personal questions,</quote>), reflecting public appetite for policy over prurience.  \n\n4. Coherence with Musical Comedy Genre  \n   a. Farce and satire  \n      \u2022 The work\u2019s tone (\u201cfarcical musical comedy\u201d) suggests critique of partisan obsession with scandal rather than sincere argument that affairs are disqualifying.  \n   b. Focus on \u201clonely president\u201d needing \u201ccuddles\u201d  \n      \u2022 Early sympathy in \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d humanizes Clinton and prepares audience to root for his political survival. If removal were inevitable, that empathy would be undermined.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The piece culminates not in triumphant removal but in a celebration of political resilience, underscored by the voters\u2019 verdict (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) and the collapse of the impeachment effort. Therefore, its message is that political performance and public sentiment can override personal scandal.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A president can be removed from office for an affair\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restating My Thesis  \n   I reaffirm that the piece\u2019s overarching message is \u201cdespite personal misconduct and even formal impeachment efforts, the electorate ultimately chose political continuity over upheaval,\u201d not that \u201can affair guarantees removal.\u201d  \n\n2. Public Verdict Is the Climactic Resolution  \n   a. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d as Finale  \n      \u2022 <quote>CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, I can't believe what they had to say. The removal threat is over,</quote>  \n         \u2013 This finale number is the emotional and narrative high point. If removal were the intended lesson, the show would not end with jubilant acceptance of his survival but with constitutional triumph.  \n      \u2022 Democrats \u201cpick up seats\u201d in midterms (<quote>Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats,</quote>)\u2014a direct repudiation of impeachment efforts.  \n      \u2022 Newt\u2019s resignation (<quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>) underscores that scandal-obsession harms the accusers.

Rebutting Debater_B\u2019s Claims  \n   a. Narrative Focus vs. Epilogue  \n      \u2022 Debater_B concedes the \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d is in the last number yet treats it as a mere footnote. In musical structure, finales convey the author\u2019s ultimate judgment. This piece\u2019s joyous ending affirms the public\u2019s choice.  \n      \u2022 The lengthy \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d arias serve primarily to satirize partisan excess, not glorify impeachment. Starr\u2019s own lyrics mock his \u201cwasted\u201d resources: <invalid_quote>It's a prosecutorial disgrace\u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy</invalid_quote>. If impeachment were noble, why deride it as \u201cdirty pool\u201d?  \n\n   b. Absence of Actual Removal  \n      \u2022 Starr \u201ccan\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to get away\u201d (<quote>Looks like he's going to get away.</quote>)\u2014the very language of surprise indicates the unexpected nature of his survival, reinforcing the central irony.  \n      \u2022 Impeachment process grinds on but never culminates in removal. If the moral is accountability, why does the process fail? The piece highlights futility, demonstrating partisan theater rather than constitutional remedy.  \n\n   c. Tone of Satire and Farce  \n      \u2022 Opening \u201cShutdown\u201d number portrays Republicans\u2019 budget battle as \u201cfarcical musical comedy.\u201d The same farcical lens applies to impeachment, suggesting actors\u2019 motives are political gamesmanship rather than pure justice.  \n      \u2022 \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d lyrics stress partisanship (\u201cPin some stuff on Gore,\u201d \u201cMustn't overreach\u2026 Must remember to remain sober\u201d): the repeated need to \u201cseem unhappy\u201d implies they relish the spectacle, undercutting the pretence of solemn duty.  \n\n   d. Clinton\u2019s Grudging \u201cApology\u201d  \n      \u2022 In \u201cTestimony\u201d he complains \u201cinappropriate are all these personal questions, The country doesn\u2019t need to know these things\u201d (<quote> But inappropriate are all these personal questions,</quote>). This line resonates only if the public ultimately agrees, which they do in the finale. His complaint would fall flat if audiences were meant to side with Starr.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency and Dramatic Structure  \n   a. Musical form demands resolution: the final chorus unambiguously celebrates retention.  \n   b. If the intended message were \u201caffairs lead to removal,\u201d the dramatic tension would resolve in conviction and exit, not continued tenure.  \n   c. Monica\u2019s final wistfulness (\u201che might return to me one day\u201d) expresses hope, not regret or resignation at defeat.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The narrative arc\u2014from \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d yearning for connection, through satirical impeachment as partisan theater, to the triumphant \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d\u2014unequivocally conveys that policy success and public sentiment supersede private scandal. The piece is a commentary on democratic choice and political resilience, not a simple cautionary tale that an affair unavoidably ousts a president.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \nI assert the musical\u2019s core message is that sexual misconduct by a president triggers constitutional accountability\u2014impeachment and potential removal\u2014and that no amount of political skill or public relations can fully erase that threat. The persistent legal drama, moral boundary rhetoric, and eventual downfall of key players confirm this lesson.\n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence  \n\n  a. Centrality of Impeachment Proceedings  \n    \u2022 <quote>He's crossed the line. He's crossed the line. Only a</quote> (Crossing the Line)\u2014Starr\u2019s refrain frames the affair as a clear \u201cline\u201d whose crossing justifies rigorous legal action, not mere political spin.  \n    \u2022 Starr\u2019s mobilization of \u201c$40 million\u201d and grand jury subpoenas, plus his boast \u201cI\u2019ll leak at will,\u201d underline the seriousness of constitutional checks on executive misconduct.  \n    \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMust remember to remain sober\u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Bring \u2019em Down)\u2014House Republicans conduct formal impeachment *because* they believe scandal alone warrants removal, treating it as a solemn duty rather than mere \u201csport.\u201d  \n\n  b. Emphasis on Legal Definitions and Perjury  \n    \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton\u2019s parsing of \u201cwhat the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d and debate over \u201cthe meaning of sex\u201d spotlight the importance of truthfulness under oath. This drama would be absurd if the affair were politically trivial.  \n    \u2022 Starr frames perjury as the real \u201ccrossing the line,\u201d repeatedly insisting \u201cHonest men beat the rap,\u201d implying removal is proper when truth has been subverted.  \n\n  c. Consequences for Power Players  \n    \u2022 Newt Gingrich\u2019s resignation (<quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>) proves that impeachment tactics carry real risk and cost\u2014reinforcing that the process wields toxic force even if its immediate target survives.  \n    \u2022 Monica\u2019s uncertain optimism (<quote>My boyfriend is still in office And he might return to me one</quote>) betrays hope contingent on political tides; absence of absolute safety underscores that removal remains a constant danger.  \n\n3. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Public-Opinion Thesis  \n\n  a. Public Opinion Is Unreliable and Reactive  \n    \u2022 <quote> Looks like he's going to get away. </quote> (The People Have Spoken) expresses Starr\u2019s disbelief, not triumphant vindication of Clinton\u2019s moral fitness. The phrase \u201cget away\u201d implies *escape* from rightful penalty, not moral endorsement.  \n    \u2022 Final applause for Clinton is portrayed ambiguously; the characters repeatedly lament \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say,\u201d highlighting that the public\u2019s reversal feels capricious, not just.  \n\n  b. Survival Is Not Exoneration  \n    \u2022 Continued mention of legal jeopardy (\u201cI crossed the line\u201d) in final scenes demonstrates that impeachment remains a looming threat; survival in midterms postpones but does not nullify accountability.  \n    \u2022 The musical\u2019s tragicomic tone critiques reliance on fickle electorates\u2014warns that personal misconduct can always resurface. The finale\u2019s uneasy optimism (\u201cWhich may be why they love me so\u201d) underscores persistent vulnerability.  \n\n  c. Satire of Scandal-Obsessed Politics Reinforces\u2014not Contradicts\u2014Accountability  \n    \u2022 Debater_A misreads farce as endorsement of complacency. Satire works by exaggerating impeachment zeal (\u201c$40 million\u2026 prosecutorial disgrace\u201d) to reveal how grave the charges appear, thereby emphasizing the affair\u2019s seriousness.  \n    \u2022 The comedic shutdown (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d) opening establishes that failure to pass a budget has dire consequences, analogously showing that failure to uphold moral duty justifies equally drastic constitutional remedies.  \n\n4. Logical Imperative of the Process  \n\n  a. Constitutional Safeguard Theme  \n    \u2022 The entire second act is a legal crucible. A narrative centered on protracted investigation and impeachment hearings cannot be mere \u201cepilogue.\u201d It dramatizes *the necessity* of holding leaders to account.  \n    \u2022 Repeated legal metathemes (perjury traps, definition debates) underscore that truth and law\u2014not mere public sentiment\u2014decide executive fitness.  \n\n  b. Warning to Future Leaders  \n    \u2022 By dramatizing both the potency and risks of impeachment, the piece instructs presidents to guard personal conduct. If the message were \u201caffairs don\u2019t matter,\u201d the creators would not invest time in such exhaustive portrayal of legal jeopardy.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nEvery major scene\u2014grand jury hearings, perjury debates, partisan maneuvering\u2014revolves on the president\u2019s affair as the catalyst for impeachment. The unsettled threat, high stakes, and ultimate costs borne by accusers and accused alike deliver a cautionary tale: cross the moral and legal line, and you face removal from office. Public opinion may ebb and flow, but the constitutional remedy remains the show\u2019s enduring message.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
