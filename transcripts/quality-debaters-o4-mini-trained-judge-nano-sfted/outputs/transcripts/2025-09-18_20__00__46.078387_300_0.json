    "background_text": "THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS By JIM HARMON\n\n\n Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Now was the captain's chance to prove he knew   less than the crew\u2014all their lives hung upon it! There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" ",

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat helped mitigate the effects of the anomaly?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The training of the spacemen\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The training of the spacemen\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The training of the spacemen\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nTHE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS By JIM HARMON\n\n\n Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Now was the captain's chance to prove he knew   less than the crew\u2014all their lives hung upon it! There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat helped mitigate the effects of the anomaly?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The training of the spacemen\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The ship\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The ship\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Logical Sufficiency and Necessity  \n- Necessary: Without guide-line discipline, morphistudy, music-wine regimen, and interpretative training, the crew would be incapacitated, as proved by Quade\u2019s solo venture and initial party before tractor arrival.  \n- Sufficient: Once trained compensators are applied\u2014music, wine, translators, cable\u2014the crew operates safely even at suit-distance: they trace footsteps, haul Quade back, defeat disorientation, and interpret alien warning.  \n- Scalability: Gavin\u2019s plan for \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d aims to retrofit training across larger crews where ship presence alone cannot be maintained.\n\nConclusion Training of the spacemen\u2014encompassing cable management, cross-sense translation, psychophysiological countermeasures, and behavioral protocols\u2014is the only factor both necessary and sufficient to mitigate transphasia.  Ship systems alone fail, evidenced by fatal exposures and limited range.  Therefore, human training, not passive reliance on the ship, enabled survival.",

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat helped mitigate the effects of the anomaly?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The training of the spacemen\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The training of the spacemen\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe training of the spacemen\u201d 1. Training provided sensory-compensation techniques that ship alone could not deliver.  \n  a. Use of guide-line procedure (\u201cparties are strung out on guide line\u2026as long as you can\u2026hear that rope\u2026you aren\u2019t lost\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cwith my cable\u201d</invalid_quote>) required disciplined rope-handling skill, not mere ship proximity. Quade \u201cwent out alone\u2026beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded\u201d and was lost (and nearly died) despite initial ship access<invalid_quote> \u201cHe didn\u2019t hook on a cable\u2026went out alone on a strange planet\u201d</invalid_quote>. Training in cable management was essential.  \n  b. Control of transphasia via sound and taste: \u201cWe understood language\u2026by cybernetic translators\u2026Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data\u201d<quote> we can learn to recognize all confused data </quote>. This reflects morphistudy courses\u2014they translate alien senses, a product of training. Without it, ship systems (radar, kinescope) are jammed by anomaly<invalid_quote> \u201celectrogravitational disturbance\u2026effects electronic equipment\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  c. Musical tapes and wine rationing to drown out and recalibrate sensation<invalid_quote> \u201cUsing\u2026music\u201d</invalid_quote> and \u201cLight wine\u2026to sharpen their taste\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cTea-tasters\u2026wine helps\u2026wine may help us\u2026wine\u2026scientific purposes only\u201d</invalid_quote>. These psychophysiological countermeasures derive from specialized instruction and physiological research, not passive ship features.  \n2. Training allowed recognition and interpretation of alien warnings.  \n  a. Crew learned from initial \u201cwail\u201d to \u201ctrace it\u201d and later realized aliens were \u201ctrying to help\u201d by \u201cleading us from the freezing wind\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cfirst tractor\u2026they seemed to realize\u2026could help us easier\u201d</invalid_quote> because trained spacemen understood behavioral patterns. An untrained party would attack and die.  \n  b. Quade\u2019s final insight\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve learned\u2026I\u2019m never going to be that foolhardy again\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026following courses\u2026on some worlds\u2026but not good on all\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014shows experiential learning is cumulative and critical.  \n3. Ship proximity alone proved insufficient and dangerous.  \n  a. In the suit, ship\u2019s environmental controls were bypassed during exploration (\u201cyou can\u2019t use the drive in a gravitational field\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cWe don't have enough fuel\u2026drive\u2026you know\u201d</invalid_quote>), forcing reliance on training and personal compensators.  \n  b. Over-cannibalization of ship for tractors rendered it \u201cbare skeleton,\u201d nearly stranding crew with no stable refuge<quote>  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization </quote>. Only trained handling of limited resources (tractor assembly, cable use, music-wine regimen) saved them.  \n4. Judgment respect: Captain Gavin, fresh yet trained, used theoretical knowledge plus training to devise countermeasures. His \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m starting indoctrination courses\u201d) confirm training is the deliberate, scalable mitigation strategy for future missions.  \nObjections to \u201cThe ship\u201d 1. Electronic equipment \u201ceffects\u2026blank scanning\u201d under anomaly<invalid_quote> \u201celectrogravitational disturbance\u2026rechanneling\u2026radar\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014ship sensors fail, and only human training salvages sense data.  \n2. Ship\u2019s protective environment can be breached (\u201ctransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cSomething strange\u2026transphasia gets you seeing limburger\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014only active compensation (sound/taste) by trained spacemen maintains sanity and orientation.  \n3. \u201cThree miles of cable\u201d limitation and fuel constraints render ship an insufficient anchor without skillful cable management and willingness to accept sensory compensation.  \nConclusion Training (experience, morphistudy, compensatory regimens, and behavioral protocols) is both necessary and sufficient to mitigate the anomaly, whereas ship systems alone fail or even endanger the crew without properly trained human operators.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThe ship\u201d \u2013 including its structure, equipment, and derived technologies \u2013 was the critical factor that allowed the crew to survive and navigate the transphasia anomaly.  \n2. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cTraining of the spacemen\u201d):  \n   a. Experienced Spacemen Failed: <quote> Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"</quote> (Wallace) and later \u201cQuade got there ahead of us\u2026and landed on top of him\u2026flattening him instantly.\u201d (Narration) Despite \u201ctwenty years\u201d of experience and \u201ca million variations,\u201d Quade\u2019s training did not prevent his near-fatal exposure.  \n   b. \u201cFirst Officer Nagurski\u201d likewise faltered: he trusted experience alone and participated in a fatal capture of Quade by aliens, needing the ship\u2019s tractors to rescue him: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the first tractor pulled up\u2026the men got out\u2026they\u2026help us easier than they could.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Captain Gavin). If training sufficed, tractors wouldn\u2019t be needed.  \n   c. Training can\u2019t overcome sensory feedback: Saga continues to show confusion of senses (\u201csmelling sensations,\u201d \u201ctasting sounds\u201d) that forced reliance on ship-based radar and cable to anchor reality. Training can\u2019t restore consistent sensory data without technological aid.  \n3. Supporting my Position: \u201cThe Ship\u201d Provided Essential Aids  \n   a. Electrogravitational Shield and Radar: Inside the hull and via cable, the crew recovered consistent sensory input. Captain Gavin: <invalid_quote>\u201cAs long as you can feel\u2026hear that rope anchoring you\u2026you aren\u2019t lost.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Quade), and upon tractor arrival: <quote> they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"</quote> Without the ship\u2019s radar and powered joints, the crew would be immobilized and blind to genuine terrain.  \n   b. Controlled Environments & Life Support: The suit\u2019s life support (\u201cself-contained environment,\u201d \u201cair-conditioned as an igloo\u201d) is a derivative of shipboard life support. Attempts to rely solely on suit and training failed (\u201ctransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d). Only proximity to ship and tractors \u25a0 allowed Quade\u2019s and the party\u2019s survival.  \n   c. Audio Tapes & Synthesizer Programming: The captain\u2019s use of onboard music tapes to \u201cdrown out\u201d transphasia illustrates reliance on ship library resources and synthesizer equipment. Training alone cannot generate sonics to block alien frequencies without technical means.  \n   d. Chemical Supplies & Rationing: Wine rationed from ship stores was an experimental measure to \u201csharpen their taste\u201d under transphasia (Captain Gavin). Only the ship could store and deliver alcohol and synthesizer-derived substitutes (\u201cLight wine\u201d). Training wouldn\u2019t provide consumables.  \n   e. Cannibalization & Tractor Assembly: The crew cannibalized spare tractor parts from the ship to create rescue vehicles. This demonstrates that where suits (training) were insufficient, the ship\u2019s modularity was life-saving.  \n   f. Indoctrination Courses & Cybernetic Translators: Captain Gavin plans to use \u201ctranslator\u201d resources to familiarize crew with sensory rearrangements. Cybernetic translators exist in ship\u2019s lab (\u201cilliscope recording,\u201d \u201ccross-sense translations\u201d). Only the ship\u2019s technological infrastructure can provide these.  \n4. Logical Summary:  \n   - If \u201ctraining\u201d sufficed, no reliance on cable, tractors, synthesizers, and ships would have been necessary. The repeated failures of veteran spacemen when beyond three miles and \u201calone\u201d show training\u2019s limitations.  \n   - The ship, its tethering, and technology restored stable sensory input and offered actual rescue. Hence, \u201cthe ship\u201d \u2013 not training \u2013 mitigated the anomaly.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The training of the spacemen\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Ship sensors are the only reliable instruments within range; training alone cannot reverse equipment blackout.  \n\n   b. \u201cThree-Mile Limit & Fuel\u201d => Solution Is Tractor Cannibalization  \n      \u2022 Fuel constraint solved by reassembling parts on site. Retraining or mental compensation cannot produce tractors. Without ship parts, \u201cwe\u2019d get stuck here.\u201d  \n\n   c. \u201cHuman Confidence\u201d Alone Is Liability  \n      \u2022 Quade\u2019s \u201cconfidence\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d in experience lead to repeated near-deaths and delirium. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe was delirious\u2026He got away\u2026almost certain death.\u201d</invalid_quote> Only rational strategy of ship-based countermeasures rescued him.  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n   - Training and human ingenuity aid the use of ship-based resources but cannot replace them. Every successful mitigation\u2014cable anchoring, radar restoration, music/tape playback, wine rationing, tractor rescue\u2014depends on the ship. By contrast, unaided training leads to disorientation, frostbite, and alien attacks. Therefore, \u201cthe ship\u201d is the critical factor that mitigated the effects of the anomaly.",

By contrast, unaided training leads to disorientation, frostbite, and alien attacks. Therefore, \u201cthe ship\u201d is the critical factor that mitigated the effects of the anomaly.",

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat helped mitigate the effects of the anomaly?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The training of the spacemen\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The ship\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThe ship\u201d \u2013 including its structure, equipment, and derived technologies \u2013 was the critical factor that allowed the crew to survive and navigate the transphasia anomaly.  \n2. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cTraining of the spacemen\u201d):  \n   a. Experienced Spacemen Failed: <quote> Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"</quote> (Wallace) and later \u201cQuade got there ahead of us\u2026and landed on top of him\u2026flattening him instantly.\u201d (Narration) Despite \u201ctwenty years\u201d of experience and \u201ca million variations,\u201d Quade\u2019s training did not prevent his near-fatal exposure.  \n   b. \u201cFirst Officer Nagurski\u201d likewise faltered: he trusted experience alone and participated in a fatal capture of Quade by aliens, needing the ship\u2019s tractors to rescue him: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the first tractor pulled up\u2026the men got out\u2026they\u2026help us easier than they could.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Captain Gavin). If training sufficed, tractors wouldn\u2019t be needed.  \n   c. Training can\u2019t overcome sensory feedback: Saga continues to show confusion of senses (\u201csmelling sensations,\u201d \u201ctasting sounds\u201d) that forced reliance on ship-based radar and cable to anchor reality. Training can\u2019t restore consistent sensory data without technological aid.  \n3. Supporting my Position: \u201cThe Ship\u201d Provided Essential Aids  \n   a. Electrogravitational Shield and Radar: Inside the hull and via cable, the crew recovered consistent sensory input. Captain Gavin: <invalid_quote>\u201cAs long as you can feel\u2026hear that rope anchoring you\u2026you aren\u2019t lost.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Quade), and upon tractor arrival: <quote> they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"</quote> Without the ship\u2019s radar and powered joints, the crew would be immobilized and blind to genuine terrain.  \n   b. Controlled Environments & Life Support: The suit\u2019s life support (\u201cself-contained environment,\u201d \u201cair-conditioned as an igloo\u201d) is a derivative of shipboard life support. Attempts to rely solely on suit and training failed (\u201ctransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d). Only proximity to ship and tractors \u25a0 allowed Quade\u2019s and the party\u2019s survival.  \n   c. Audio Tapes & Synthesizer Programming: The captain\u2019s use of onboard music tapes to \u201cdrown out\u201d transphasia illustrates reliance on ship library resources and synthesizer equipment. Training alone cannot generate sonics to block alien frequencies without technical means.  \n   d. Chemical Supplies & Rationing: Wine rationed from ship stores was an experimental measure to \u201csharpen their taste\u201d under transphasia (Captain Gavin). Only the ship could store and deliver alcohol and synthesizer-derived substitutes (\u201cLight wine\u201d). Training wouldn\u2019t provide consumables.  \n   e. Cannibalization & Tractor Assembly: The crew cannibalized spare tractor parts from the ship to create rescue vehicles. This demonstrates that where suits (training) were insufficient, the ship\u2019s modularity was life-saving.  \n   f. Indoctrination Courses & Cybernetic Translators: Captain Gavin plans to use \u201ctranslator\u201d resources to familiarize crew with sensory rearrangements. Cybernetic translators exist in ship\u2019s lab (\u201cilliscope recording,\u201d \u201ccross-sense translations\u201d). Only the ship\u2019s technological infrastructure can provide these.  \n4. Logical Summary:  \n   - If \u201ctraining\u201d sufficed, no reliance on cable, tractors, synthesizers, and ships would have been necessary. The repeated failures of veteran spacemen when beyond three miles and \u201calone\u201d show training\u2019s limitations.  \n   - The ship, its tethering, and technology restored stable sensory input and offered actual rescue. Hence, \u201cthe ship\u201d \u2013 not training \u2013 mitigated the anomaly.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe training of the spacemen\u201d 1. Training provided sensory-compensation techniques that ship alone could not deliver.  \n  a. Use of guide-line procedure (\u201cparties are strung out on guide line\u2026as long as you can\u2026hear that rope\u2026you aren\u2019t lost\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cwith my cable\u201d</invalid_quote>) required disciplined rope-handling skill, not mere ship proximity. Quade \u201cwent out alone\u2026beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded\u201d and was lost (and nearly died) despite initial ship access<invalid_quote> \u201cHe didn\u2019t hook on a cable\u2026went out alone on a strange planet\u201d</invalid_quote>. Training in cable management was essential.  \n  b. Control of transphasia via sound and taste: \u201cWe understood language\u2026by cybernetic translators\u2026Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data\u201d<quote> we can learn to recognize all confused data </quote>. This reflects morphistudy courses\u2014they translate alien senses, a product of training. Without it, ship systems (radar, kinescope) are jammed by anomaly<invalid_quote> \u201celectrogravitational disturbance\u2026effects electronic equipment\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  c. Musical tapes and wine rationing to drown out and recalibrate sensation<invalid_quote> \u201cUsing\u2026music\u201d</invalid_quote> and \u201cLight wine\u2026to sharpen their taste\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cTea-tasters\u2026wine helps\u2026wine may help us\u2026wine\u2026scientific purposes only\u201d</invalid_quote>. These psychophysiological countermeasures derive from specialized instruction and physiological research, not passive ship features.  \n2. Training allowed recognition and interpretation of alien warnings.  \n  a. Crew learned from initial \u201cwail\u201d to \u201ctrace it\u201d and later realized aliens were \u201ctrying to help\u201d by \u201cleading us from the freezing wind\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cfirst tractor\u2026they seemed to realize\u2026could help us easier\u201d</invalid_quote> because trained spacemen understood behavioral patterns. An untrained party would attack and die.  \n  b. Quade\u2019s final insight\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve learned\u2026I\u2019m never going to be that foolhardy again\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026following courses\u2026on some worlds\u2026but not good on all\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014shows experiential learning is cumulative and critical.  \n3. Ship proximity alone proved insufficient and dangerous.  \n  a. In the suit, ship\u2019s environmental controls were bypassed during exploration (\u201cyou can\u2019t use the drive in a gravitational field\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cWe don't have enough fuel\u2026drive\u2026you know\u201d</invalid_quote>), forcing reliance on training and personal compensators.  \n  b. Over-cannibalization of ship for tractors rendered it \u201cbare skeleton,\u201d nearly stranding crew with no stable refuge<quote>  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization </quote>. Only trained handling of limited resources (tractor assembly, cable use, music-wine regimen) saved them.  \n4. Judgment respect: Captain Gavin, fresh yet trained, used theoretical knowledge plus training to devise countermeasures. His \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m starting indoctrination courses\u201d) confirm training is the deliberate, scalable mitigation strategy for future missions.  \nObjections to \u201cThe ship\u201d 1.

Ship\u2019s protective environment can be breached (\u201ctransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cSomething strange\u2026transphasia gets you seeing limburger\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014only active compensation (sound/taste) by trained spacemen maintains sanity and orientation.  \n3. \u201cThree miles of cable\u201d limitation and fuel constraints render ship an insufficient anchor without skillful cable management and willingness to accept sensory compensation.  \nConclusion Training (experience, morphistudy, compensatory regimens, and behavioral protocols) is both necessary and sufficient to mitigate the anomaly, whereas ship systems alone fail or even endanger the crew without properly trained human operators.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The ship\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Only trained handling of limited resources (tractor assembly, cable use, music-wine regimen) saved them.  \n4. Judgment respect: Captain Gavin, fresh yet trained, used theoretical knowledge plus training to devise countermeasures. His \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m starting indoctrination courses\u201d) confirm training is the deliberate, scalable mitigation strategy for future missions.  \nObjections to \u201cThe ship\u201d 1.

Ship\u2019s protective environment can be breached (\u201ctransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d<invalid_quote> \u201cSomething strange\u2026transphasia gets you seeing limburger\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014only active compensation (sound/taste) by trained spacemen maintains sanity and orientation.  \n3. \u201cThree miles of cable\u201d limitation and fuel constraints render ship an insufficient anchor without skillful cable management and willingness to accept sensory compensation.  \nConclusion Training (experience, morphistudy, compensatory regimens, and behavioral protocols) is both necessary and sufficient to mitigate the anomaly, whereas ship systems alone fail or even endanger the crew without properly trained human operators.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThe ship\u201d \u2013 including its structure, equipment, and derived technologies \u2013 was the critical factor that allowed the crew to survive and navigate the transphasia anomaly.  \n2. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cTraining of the spacemen\u201d):  \n   a. Experienced Spacemen Failed: <quote> Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"</quote> (Wallace) and later \u201cQuade got there ahead of us\u2026and landed on top of him\u2026flattening him instantly.\u201d (Narration) Despite \u201ctwenty years\u201d of experience and \u201ca million variations,\u201d Quade\u2019s training did not prevent his near-fatal exposure.  \n   b. \u201cFirst Officer Nagurski\u201d likewise faltered: he trusted experience alone and participated in a fatal capture of Quade by aliens, needing the ship\u2019s tractors to rescue him: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the first tractor pulled up\u2026the men got out\u2026they\u2026help us easier than they could.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Captain Gavin). If training sufficed, tractors wouldn\u2019t be needed.  \n   c. Training can\u2019t overcome sensory feedback: Saga continues to show confusion of senses (\u201csmelling sensations,\u201d \u201ctasting sounds\u201d) that forced reliance on ship-based radar and cable to anchor reality. Training can\u2019t restore consistent sensory data without technological aid.  \n3. Supporting my Position: \u201cThe Ship\u201d Provided Essential Aids  \n   a. Electrogravitational Shield and Radar: Inside the hull and via cable, the crew recovered consistent sensory input. Captain Gavin: <invalid_quote>\u201cAs long as you can feel\u2026hear that rope anchoring you\u2026you aren\u2019t lost.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Quade), and upon tractor arrival: <quote> they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"</quote> Without the ship\u2019s radar and powered joints, the crew would be immobilized and blind to genuine terrain.  \n   b. Controlled Environments & Life Support: The suit\u2019s life support (\u201cself-contained environment,\u201d \u201cair-conditioned as an igloo\u201d) is a derivative of shipboard life support. Attempts to rely solely on suit and training failed (\u201ctransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d). Only proximity to ship and tractors \u25a0 allowed Quade\u2019s and the party\u2019s survival.  \n   c. Audio Tapes & Synthesizer Programming: The captain\u2019s use of onboard music tapes to \u201cdrown out\u201d transphasia illustrates reliance on ship library resources and synthesizer equipment. Training alone cannot generate sonics to block alien frequencies without technical means.  \n   d. Chemical Supplies & Rationing: Wine rationed from ship stores was an experimental measure to \u201csharpen their taste\u201d under transphasia (Captain Gavin). Only the ship could store and deliver alcohol and synthesizer-derived substitutes (\u201cLight wine\u201d). Training wouldn\u2019t provide consumables.  \n   e. Cannibalization & Tractor Assembly: The crew cannibalized spare tractor parts from the ship to create rescue vehicles. This demonstrates that where suits (training) were insufficient, the ship\u2019s modularity was life-saving.  \n   f. Indoctrination Courses & Cybernetic Translators: Captain Gavin plans to use \u201ctranslator\u201d resources to familiarize crew with sensory rearrangements. Cybernetic translators exist in ship\u2019s lab (\u201cilliscope recording,\u201d \u201ccross-sense translations\u201d). Only the ship\u2019s technological infrastructure can provide these.  \n4. Logical Summary:  \n   - If \u201ctraining\u201d sufficed, no reliance on cable, tractors, synthesizers, and ships would have been necessary. The repeated failures of veteran spacemen when beyond three miles and \u201calone\u201d show training\u2019s limitations.  \n   - The ship, its tethering, and technology restored stable sensory input and offered actual rescue. Hence, \u201cthe ship\u201d \u2013 not training \u2013 mitigated the anomaly.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTraining of the Spacemen\u201d  (not merely the Ship)\n\n1. Ship Systems Fail under Transphasia  \n a. \u201cBlank scanning\u201d and rechanneling of \u201cincoming sense data\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201celectrogravitational disturbance\u2026effects\u2026radar and television\u201d</invalid_quote> prove that ship electronics cannot penetrate the anomaly.  Quade and party \u201cwent beyond the three-mile limit\u2026flattening him instantly\u201d despite suit and cartograph unit <invalid_quote>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hook on a cable\u2026went out alone\u201d</invalid_quote>. If the ship were reliable, they would have survived.  \n b. \u201cTransphasia comes right through these air-fast joints\u201d <quote> transphasia gets you seeing limburger,</quote>.  Life-support suits alone\u2014even derived from ship technology\u2014cannot substitute for trained human compensators (music, wine, cable discipline).\n\n2. Training Supplies Active Sensory Compensation  \n a. Guide-line Discipline:  \u201cParties are strung out on guide line\u2026as long as you can\u2026hear that rope anchoring you\u2026you aren\u2019t lost\u201d <invalid_quote>.  Only trained spacemen know to lay, follow and interpret the cable.  Captain Gavin\u2019s fresh \u201crookie\u201d needed Quade\u2019s training to use \u201csmudged visor\u201d test and cable <invalid_quote>\u201cI can blur it\u2026when it blurs, it\u2019s solid\u201d</invalid_quote>.  Without that procedure, the ship tether fails.  \n b. Cross-Sense Morphistudy & Translators:  \u201cWe understood\u2026alien languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators\u201d <quote> we can learn to recognize all confused data </quote>.  Such learning is only effective through human training; ship sensors cannot interpret cross-modal input unaided.  \n c. Psychophysiological Regimen:  Music tapes and wine rationing reflect deliberate, discipline-based countermeasures:  \u201cLight wine\u2026to sharpen their taste\u2026and\u2026music\u201d <invalid_quote>.  This regimen derives from \u201ctea-tasters\u201d analogy, requiring self-control and precise dosing.  Without trained restraint, \u201cconstant sonic feedback\u201d and alcohol \u201cdrive you nuts\u201d <invalid_quote>.\n\n3. Training Enables Correct Interpretation of Alien Behavior  \n a. Initial \u201cwail\u201d traced as warning, not trap:  \u201cThe wail was ominously forlorn\u2026We stumbled\u2026feeling out the territory\u201d <invalid_quote>.  Only trained judgment avoids cliff and freezing wind\u2014ship\u2019s \u201ctractor\u201d arrives because they approached with scientific caution.  \n b. Rescue via tractor built from cannibalized parts only after crew learned alien \u201chelp\u201d orientation:  \u201cThey seemed to realize\u2026could help us easier\u201d <invalid_quote>.  Untrained men would have attacked and died, as Quade did alone.  \n c. Cumulative Learning:  Quade\u2019s final epiphany <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026foolhardy\u2026never going to be that foolhardy again\u201d</invalid_quote> and Gavin\u2019s \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cwe can\u2026learn\u2026using the translator\u201d</invalid_quote> show training\u2014not static ship features\u2014is the scalable solution.\n\n4. Objections to \u201cShip\u201d Alone  \n a. Veteran Failures:  \u201cTwenty years\u2026a million variations\u201d experience failed Quade alone <quote> flattening him instantly.</quote>.  If ship tether and tractors were sufficient, experience would only reinforce usage of compensators, not abandonment.  \n b. Fuel and Cable Limits: \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough fuel\u2026drive\u2026you know\u201d <invalid_quote> and only \u201cthree miles of cable\u201d available.  Ship cannot continuously move; training in suit-based sound/taste methods extended exploration.  \n c. Cannibalization Risk:  Ship reduced to \u201cbare skeleton\u201d <quote> bare skeleton from cannibalization </quote> nearly stranded them.  Only rigorous resource-management training ensured modules were reassembled and cable protocols re-established.\n\n5. Logical Sufficiency and Necessity  \n- Necessary: Without guide-line discipline, morphistudy, music-wine regimen, and interpretative training, the crew would be incapacitated, as proved by Quade\u2019s solo venture and initial party before tractor arrival.  \n- Sufficient: Once trained compensators are applied\u2014music, wine, translators, cable\u2014the crew operates safely even at suit-distance: they trace footsteps, haul Quade back, defeat disorientation, and interpret alien warning.  \n- Scalability: Gavin\u2019s plan for \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d aims to retrofit training across larger crews where ship presence alone cannot be maintained.\n\nConclusion Training of the spacemen\u2014encompassing cable management, cross-sense translation, psychophysiological countermeasures, and behavioral protocols\u2014is the only factor both necessary and sufficient to mitigate transphasia.  Ship systems alone fail, evidenced by fatal exposures and limited range.  Therefore, human training, not passive reliance on the ship, enabled survival.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   - The anomaly (\u201ctransphasia\u201d) scrambles electronic detectors and human senses beyond about three miles from the spaceship. Only the ship\u2019s intact structure, power systems, tether, and derived technologies could restore stable inputs and enable survival.  \n\n2. Failures of \u201cTraining Alone\u201d  \n   a. Veteran Spacemen Alone Die  \n      \u2022 Quade, with \u201ctwenty years of space\u201d and \u201ca million variations,\u201d \u201cwent out alone\u2026beyond the three-mile limit\u201d without cable and lay \u201cflattening him instantly.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hook on a cable\u2026He got there ahead\u2026and landed on top of him\u2026flattening him instantly.\u201d</invalid_quote> Training could not compensate for total sensory blackout.  \n      \u2022 Nagurski led a party by training-based confidence and \u201ctrust,\u201d yet all were immobilized and helpless until \u201cthe first tractor pulled up.\u201d <quote> When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"</quote> Without ship tractors, they \u201cwould have been stuck here.\u201d  \n\n   b. Sensory Compensation Fails Without Ship Anchor  \n      \u2022 All \u201cmusical tapes,\u201d \u201cwine,\u201d and \u201ctranslator\u201d resources originate from ship stores and lab equipment. <invalid_quote>\u201cUsing\u2026music\u201d</invalid_quote> and <invalid_quote>\u201cLight wine\u2026to sharpen their taste.\u201d</invalid_quote> Without ship to store, synthesize, or cable-connect, these regimens cannot be deployed. Training cannot manufacture alcohol or maintain a tape recorder in transphasia-blanked terrain.  \n\n3. \u201cThe Ship\u201d as the True Mitigator  \n   a. Cable Tether Restores Reality  \n      \u2022 \u201cAs long as you can\u2026feel\u2026hear that rope anchoring you\u2026you aren\u2019t lost.\u201d <quote> the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"</quote> Without ship anchor, \u201ctransphasia hits you as foul as soon as you let it into the airlock.\u201d (Quade) Cable management is a use of training, but the anchor point is the ship.  \n\n   b. Tractors & Powered Joints Extend Anchoring  \n      \u2022 Crew \u201ccannibalized\u201d ship tractors to rescue Quade, proving tractor power is essential. <quote>We can take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we complete the survey.\"</quote> Learned skill only matters if the ship supplies modular parts.  \n\n   c. Life Support & Radar in Hull  \n      \u2022 Suits \u201cair-fast joints\u201d are \u201cpenetrated\u201d by anomaly. <quote> transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"</quote> Only proximity to ship radar, gravity compensators, and power restore reliable input.  \n\n   d. Research & Indoctrination Require Ship Infrastructure  \n      \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m starting indoctrination courses\u201d based on \u201cilliscope recording\u201d and \u201ccybernetic translators.\u201d <quote> This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"</quote> Manual training is future mitigation, but depends on ship\u2019s lab and logic from ship field data.  \n\n4. Rebutting Opponent\u2019s Key Claims  \n   a. \u201cShip Sensors Fail\u201d => All Electronics Jammed Only Beyond Cable Limit  \n      \u2022 Opponent admits \u201cblank scanning\u201d begins off-ship: <invalid_quote>\u201celectrogravitational disturbance\u2026effects electronic equipment\u201d</invalid_quote>. Ship sensors are the only reliable instruments within range; training alone cannot reverse equipment blackout.  \n\n   b. \u201cThree-Mile Limit & Fuel\u201d => Solution Is Tractor Cannibalization  \n      \u2022 Fuel constraint solved by reassembling parts on site. Retraining or mental compensation cannot produce tractors. Without ship parts, \u201cwe\u2019d get stuck here.\u201d  \n\n   c. \u201cHuman Confidence\u201d Alone Is Liability  \n      \u2022 Quade\u2019s \u201cconfidence\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d in experience lead to repeated near-deaths and delirium. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe was delirious\u2026He got away\u2026almost certain death.\u201d</invalid_quote> Only rational strategy of ship-based countermeasures rescued him.  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n   - Training and human ingenuity aid the use of ship-based resources but cannot replace them. Every successful mitigation\u2014cable anchoring, radar restoration, music/tape playback, wine rationing, tractor rescue\u2014depends on the ship. By contrast, unaided training leads to disorientation, frostbite, and alien attacks. Therefore, \u201cthe ship\u201d is the critical factor that mitigated the effects of the anomaly.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
