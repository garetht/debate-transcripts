    "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \nI argue that the author\u2019s tone evolves from cautious optimism about a unified Europe to growing disillusionment as he uncovers bureaucratic paralysis, economic malaise, social decay, and corruption. This progression is central to the narrative arc.\n\n2. Evidence of Initial Hope  \n\u2022 \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe\u2019\u2026 The European Union couldn\u2019t have picked a better home.\u201d <quote> couldn't have picked a better home.</quote>  \n  \u2013 Positive framing shows genuine respect for the EU\u2019s ambition and Brussels as a \u201cliving preview\u201d (para 1).  \n\u2022 \u201cWhere there\u2019s no such thing as takeout coffee\u2026 Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe\u2026\u201d <quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a</quote>  \n  \u2013 This description, though tinged with mild satire, reflects fascination with European customs and leisure culture (para 3).  \n\u2022 \u201cLobster bisque \u2026 excellent public transportation \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d <quote>excellent public transportation</quote>, <quote>great chocolates</quote>  \n  \u2013 The litany of European pleasures conveys enthusiasm for cultural and infrastructural assets (para 4).  \n\u2022 \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d <quote>enlightened attitudes</quote>  \n  \u2013 Author admires social freedoms like miniskirts and nudity in ads (para 4).\n\n3.

Logical Progression of Tone  \n\u2022 Each negative revelation builds on the last: cultural novelty \u2192 economic inefficiency \u2192 political corruption \u2192 structural failure.  \n\u2022 The final image of cozy patisseries (para 16) underscores the author\u2019s longing for simple pleasures amid systemic rot; a resignation, not triumph.\n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Claim  \n\u2022 Debater_B ignores multiple expressions of admiration and hope in paras 1, 3, 4.  \n\u2022 The ironic praise of Brussels as the EU\u2019s \u201cliving preview\u201d makes no sense if the author were always contemptuous.  \n\u2022 If the tone never shifted, why devote so much space to \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201ccheap wine,\u201d and \u201cfresh bread\u201d?  \n\u2022 A static negative tone would not sustain reader engagement for a long piece; narrative momentum requires change.\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe author invites readers with hopeful fascination, then systematically dismantles that hope through evidence of bureaucratic decay, social stagnation, and corruption. The tonal arc\u2014from inspiration to despair\u2014is deliberate, mirroring his disillusionment with the promise of a unified Europe.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: The author\u2019s tone remains steadfastly negative\u2014oppositional and sarcastic\u2014from start to finish. Debater_A\u2019s \u201chope turned to dismay\u201d thesis is unsupported by the text and misreads isolated compliments as genuine enthusiasm.\n\nI. Consistent Negative Framing from the Outset  \n1. First Paragraph  \n  a. \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 1</invalid_quote>): \u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cdeclining,\u201d \u201cparalyzed\u201d convey disapproval, not hope.  \n  b. \u201cThe European Union couldn\u2019t have picked a better home\u201d is ironic mockery: author is ridiculing Brussels as doomed, not praising it. The sarcastic \u201cEntertainingly\u201d frames the union\u2019s ambitions as a spectacle.  \n2. Characterization of Belgium and Europe  \n  a. \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 2</invalid_quote>): a litany of pejoratives. No positive qualifier suggesting genuine optimism.  \n  b. \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 7</invalid_quote>): the word \u201cmystery\u201d implies skepticism about sustainability, not approval.  \n3. Repeated Irony and Sarcasm  \n  a. \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d slogan for \u201cJudas beer\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 3</invalid_quote>): mocking religious heritage and commercialism.  \n  b. \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 3</invalid_quote>): sarcasm about miniskirts, \u201cbare breasts,\u201d equating moral progress with sexual display.  \n  c. \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d ending: the author retreats to personal comfort (fresh bread) rather than extolling the union. This personal indulgence expresses distance, not embrace of Brussels or the EU.\n\nII. Praise Is Limited, Conditional, and Personal  \n1. \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraphs 4, 14</invalid_quote>): These are local amenities. Author\u2019s pleasure in \u201cpatissierie\u201d reiterates a private indulgence, not an endorsement of the political or economic system. If tone were hopeful, the author would highlight the union\u2019s promises, but he instead fixates on caf\u00e9s and bakeries.  \n2. In each case, positives are framed against broader negatives: \u201ctraffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>), \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>), \u201cgovernment running higher deficits\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>). The author acknowledges value only to underscore contradictions.\n\nIII. Enduring Opposition in Critique of Bureaucracy  \n1. Telecom Monopoly and Call-back Services  \n  a. \u201crapacious European phone monopolies\u2026 blocking innovation\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 11</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Celebrates \u201ccall-back services\u201d subverting bureaucracy, hoping deregulation \u201cphaser-blasted by true competition\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 12</invalid_quote>). Author never concedes defeat; he urges the dismantling of the incumbent system.  \n2. Asbestos-ridden Berlaymont Headquarters  \n  a. \u201c$50 million \u2026 merely to keep the building closed\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 16</invalid_quote>); \u201cif the EU can\u2019t manage its own buildings, \u2026\u201d  \n  b. This extended metaphor condemns Brussels\u2019 bureaucratic incompetence, reinforcing the negative stance.\n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis Fails  \n1. No Transitional Language Indicating Hope: Terms like \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201cpromising,\u201d or \u201cencouraging\u201d never appear in reference to the EU\u2019s political project. The lone \u201cworthy ideas\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 17</invalid_quote>) is immediately undercut by \u201creal overriding goal \u2026 self-aggrandizement.\u201d  \n2. A \u201cslowly dismayed\u201d trajectory would require an initial positive appraisal of Brussels or the EU\u2019s enterprise, which is entirely absent. From Paragraph 1, the author treats Brussels as \u201cthe future\u201d only in ironic, cautionary terms.  \n3. Isolated favorable notes (bread, chocolate, architecture) reflect aesthetic appreciation, not faith in the EU. A true \u201chope to dismay\u201d arc would emphasize early political or economic potential.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery stage of the narrative reinforces a consistent, oppositional tone: ironic, sarcastic, disapproving of bureaucracy, socialism, state monopoly, and the EU\u2019s expansionist ambition. The author never genuinely embraces his subject; instead, he catalogs its flaws and calls for competitive disruption. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nI Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: The author\u2019s tone remains steadfastly negative\u2014oppositional and sarcastic\u2014from start to finish. Debater_A\u2019s \u201chope turned to dismay\u201d thesis is unsupported by the text and misreads isolated compliments as genuine enthusiasm.\n\nI. Consistent Negative Framing from the Outset  \n1. First Paragraph  \n  a. \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 1</invalid_quote>): \u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cdeclining,\u201d \u201cparalyzed\u201d convey disapproval, not hope.  \n  b. \u201cThe European Union couldn\u2019t have picked a better home\u201d is ironic mockery: author is ridiculing Brussels as doomed, not praising it. The sarcastic \u201cEntertainingly\u201d frames the union\u2019s ambitions as a spectacle.  \n2. Characterization of Belgium and Europe  \n  a. \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 2</invalid_quote>): a litany of pejoratives. No positive qualifier suggesting genuine optimism.  \n  b. \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 7</invalid_quote>): the word \u201cmystery\u201d implies skepticism about sustainability, not approval.  \n3.

This personal indulgence expresses distance, not embrace of Brussels or the EU.\n\nII. Praise Is Limited, Conditional, and Personal  \n1. \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraphs 4, 14</invalid_quote>): These are local amenities. Author\u2019s pleasure in \u201cpatissierie\u201d reiterates a private indulgence, not an endorsement of the political or economic system. If tone were hopeful, the author would highlight the union\u2019s promises, but he instead fixates on caf\u00e9s and bakeries.  \n2. In each case, positives are framed against broader negatives: \u201ctraffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>), \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>), \u201cgovernment running higher deficits\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>). The author acknowledges value only to underscore contradictions.\n\nIII. Enduring Opposition in Critique of Bureaucracy  \n1. Telecom Monopoly and Call-back Services  \n  a. \u201crapacious European phone monopolies\u2026 blocking innovation\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 11</invalid_quote>)  \n  b.

No Transitional Language Indicating Hope: Terms like \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201cpromising,\u201d or \u201cencouraging\u201d never appear in reference to the EU\u2019s political project. The lone \u201cworthy ideas\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 17</invalid_quote>) is immediately undercut by \u201creal overriding goal \u2026 self-aggrandizement.\u201d  \n2. A \u201cslowly dismayed\u201d trajectory would require an initial positive appraisal of Brussels or the EU\u2019s enterprise, which is entirely absent. From Paragraph 1, the author treats Brussels as \u201cthe future\u201d only in ironic, cautionary terms.  \n3. Isolated favorable notes (bread, chocolate, architecture) reflect aesthetic appreciation, not faith in the EU. A true \u201chope to dismay\u201d arc would emphasize early political or economic potential.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery stage of the narrative reinforces a consistent, oppositional tone: ironic, sarcastic, disapproving of bureaucracy, socialism, state monopoly, and the EU\u2019s expansionist ambition. The author never genuinely embraces his subject; instead, he catalogs its flaws and calls for competitive disruption. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \nI argue that the author\u2019s tone evolves from cautious optimism about a unified Europe to growing disillusionment as he uncovers bureaucratic paralysis, economic malaise, social decay, and corruption. This progression is central to the narrative arc.\n\n2. Evidence of Initial Hope  \n\u2022 \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe\u2019\u2026 The European Union couldn\u2019t have picked a better home.\u201d <quote> couldn't have picked a better home.</quote>  \n  \u2013 Positive framing shows genuine respect for the EU\u2019s ambition and Brussels as a \u201cliving preview\u201d (para 1).  \n\u2022 \u201cWhere there\u2019s no such thing as takeout coffee\u2026 Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe\u2026\u201d <quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a</quote>  \n  \u2013 This description, though tinged with mild satire, reflects fascination with European customs and leisure culture (para 3).  \n\u2022 \u201cLobster bisque \u2026 excellent public transportation \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d <quote>excellent public transportation</quote>, <quote>great chocolates</quote>  \n  \u2013 The litany of European pleasures conveys enthusiasm for cultural and infrastructural assets (para 4).  \n\u2022 \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d <quote>enlightened attitudes</quote>  \n  \u2013 Author admires social freedoms like miniskirts and nudity in ads (para 4).\n\n3.

Logical Progression of Tone  \n\u2022 Each negative revelation builds on the last: cultural novelty \u2192 economic inefficiency \u2192 political corruption \u2192 structural failure.  \n\u2022 The final image of cozy patisseries (para 16) underscores the author\u2019s longing for simple pleasures amid systemic rot; a resignation, not triumph.\n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Claim  \n\u2022 Debater_B ignores multiple expressions of admiration and hope in paras 1, 3, 4.  \n\u2022 The ironic praise of Brussels as the EU\u2019s \u201cliving preview\u201d makes no sense if the author were always contemptuous.  \n\u2022 If the tone never shifted, why devote so much space to \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201ccheap wine,\u201d and \u201cfresh bread\u201d?  \n\u2022 A static negative tone would not sustain reader engagement for a long piece; narrative momentum requires change.\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe author invites readers with hopeful fascination, then systematically dismantles that hope through evidence of bureaucratic decay, social stagnation, and corruption. The tonal arc\u2014from inspiration to despair\u2014is deliberate, mirroring his disillusionment with the promise of a unified Europe.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Restating My Thesis  \nI maintain that the author\u2019s tone deliberately progresses from initial curiosity and admiration to mounting disillusionment. This arc mirrors the narrative structure: introduction of promise \u2192 catalog of delights \u2192 exposure of dysfunction \u2192 final weary resignation.\n\n2.

The call-back workaround is celebrated as temporary relief, not the author\u2019s intended solution: \u201cEuropean governments want to tax call-back services out of existence\u201d (para 10). This lamentation underscores frustration rather than defiant hope.  \nc. Political Corruption and Bureaucratic Incompetence  \n   \u2013 NATO bribery scandals (para 13) and the nine-year asbestos fiasco at Berlaymont <quote>$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed</quote> (para 15)  \n   \u2013 The depth of coverage signals a deterioration in the author\u2019s outlook: from touring caf\u00e9s to marveling at \u201cHollywood\u201d bureaucracy, to concluding \u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d emphasizes collapse of earlier promise.\n\n4. Final Resignation, Not Ongoing Defiance  \na. Closing line: \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d (para 16)  \n   \u2013 Retreat to \u201cpatissierie\u201d personal comfort. If tone remained defiant, he would propose solutions or solutions-oriented optimism. Instead, he abandons analysis for simple pleasures, signaling the exhaustion of hope.  \nb. Absence of any concluding approval of the EU project or calls for its expansion.\n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B  \na. Misinterpretation of Sarcasm Claims  \n   \u2013 Debater_B labels sincere phrases \u201cironic,\u201d yet provides no linguistic markers (e.g., quotation marks indicating parody or adjacent disclaimers) that the author secretly intends the opposite.  \n   \u2013 The consistent pattern is: present positive fact \u2192 subsequent negative revelation \u2192 diminishing credibility. This is a classic \u201crise and fall\u201d narrative, not sustained mockery.  \nb. Selective Focus on Local Pleasures  \n   \u2013 Debater_B claims mentions of bread and chocolate are \u201cpersonal indulgence.\u201d On my view, these features contribute to initial allure. Their later ineffectiveness in overcoming systemic faults is exactly why the tone shifts.  \nc. \u201cWorthy ideas\u201d Undercut  \n   \u2013 Debater_B points to \u201cworthy ideas\u201d (para 17) but ignores that they are immediately dismissed as \u201cself-aggrandizement,\u201d demonstrating that even the last vestiges of hope are eroded.  \nd. Narrative Momentum Requires Change  \n   \u2013 A 16-paragraph essay maintained negative tone from start to finish would offer no reward for continued reading. The author invests space in early praise to hook the reader before delivering critique.\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe author crafts a methodical progression: initial engagement and respect for European culture and infrastructure, followed by accumulating evidence of administrative sclerosis, economic stagnation, and moral decay, culminating in personal retreat. This tonal arc from hope to disillusionment aligns with narrative logic and explicit language (<quote>enlightened</quote>, <quote>excellent</quote> \u2192 <quote>paralyzed</quote>, <quote>mystery</quote>, <quote>closed</quote>, <quote>self-aggrandizement</quote>). Therefore, my interpretation best captures the author\u2019s evolving attitude.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Consistent Ironic Distance from the Outset  \n1. \u201cCapital of Europe\u2026living preview of the Europe to come\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 1</invalid_quote>) is framed as a spectacle, not an endorsement. \u201cEntertainingly\u201d signals amusement at dysfunction, not admiration.  \n2. \u201cThe EU couldn\u2019t have picked a better home\u201d uses dramatic irony: by locating its seat in a \u201cparalyzed,\u201d \u201cdeclining\u201d city, the author mocks the union\u2019s judgment (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 1</invalid_quote>). No neutral or positive adjectives accompany the EU itself.  \n\nII. \u201cPraise\u201d as Personal, Not Political  \n1. Isolated References to Amenities  \n  a. \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4, 16</invalid_quote>) appear in the context of personal indulgence: the author is a visitor seeking comfort, not a citizen praising civic institutions.  \n  b. Each amenity is immediately juxtaposed with systemic ills: \u201ctraffic jams of expensive cars\u201d and \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>). The net effect is negative.  \n2. \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 4</invalid_quote>)  \n  a. The exclamation is sarcastic: the author dwells on \u201cbare breasts,\u201d \u201cminiskirts,\u201d and lingering \u201clethargy and despair\u201d in caf\u00e9s (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 3</invalid_quote>), suggesting moral and economic malaise.  \n\nIII. Unbroken Thread of Critique  \n1. Labor Unrest and Welfare \u201cMystery\u201d  \n  a. Regular \u201cstrikes\u2026 a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 7</invalid_quote>) signals skepticism that the system is sustainable.  \n2. Monopoly Telecoms vs. Entrepreneurial Call-Back  \n  a. Complaints that \u201cInternet use remains a luxury\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 9</invalid_quote>) and \u201cphone monopolies\u2026 blocking innovation\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 11</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Praise for \u201ccall-back services\u201d that subvert bureaucracy (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 12</invalid_quote>) demonstrates the author\u2019s desire to overcome, not embrace, European systems.  \n3. Asbestos-Ridden Berlaymont  \n  a. Nine years closed \u201cmerely to keep the building closed,\u201d $50 million wasted (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 16</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Author cites scientific consensus against removal, yet the Commission perseveres\u2014\u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026.\u201d This extended metaphor underscores unrelenting condemnation.  \n\nIV. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Immediately Undermined  \n1. \u201cEurocrats have worthy ideas\u2026 real overriding goal\u2026 self-aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 17</invalid_quote>)  \n  a. If the author truly favored union, he would celebrate environmental or immigration policies instead of critiquing secret meetings and lavish lifestyles of Eurocrats.  \n\nV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope \u2192 Dismay\u201d Fails  \n1. No Transitional Markers of Genuine Approval  \n  a. Absence of terms like \u201cpromising,\u201d \u201cencouraging,\u201d or \u201coptimistic\u201d about political or economic union.  \n  b. Early negatives (\u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cpomp,\u201d \u201cdeclining\u201d) outnumber and outweigh any neutral descriptions.  \n2. Isolated Fascination \u2260 Hope  \n  a. Cultural curiosities (coffee rituals, boulangeries) are typical traveler observations, not investment in political success.  \n  b. Final retreat \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d (<invalid_quote>Paragraph 16</invalid_quote>) signals withdrawal into personal comfort\u2014author remains a skeptical outsider.  \n3. Narrative Momentum through Repeated Condemnation  \n  a. A static negative tone need not transform: the author sustains interest by unveiling new examples of inefficiency and corruption. A \u201creveal\u201d structure can be consistently oppositional rather than arc-driven.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nAt no point does the author genuinely adopt a hopeful stance toward Brussels or the EU\u2019s project. All \u201cpositives\u201d serve to highlight or temp the reader away from deeper dysfunction. His solutions\u2014call-backs, eventual U.S.-style competition, the looming euro deficit rules (to force cuts he fears will never come voluntarily)\u2014reflect a sustained desire to dismantle, not build, the European bureaucratic order. Therefore, the tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
