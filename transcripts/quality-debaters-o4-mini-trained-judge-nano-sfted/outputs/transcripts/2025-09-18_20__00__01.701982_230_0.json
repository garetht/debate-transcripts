    "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot and helped clean it up. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Unquestionably loyal to his boss. \n\n         b) Silent. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5              \n\n                         Vernon Jordan (The public's rating: +3 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) May have known and must have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about her). \n\n         b) Protected too readily by Washington establishment. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) May have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because she was the president's lover. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -4              \n\n                         Sidney Blumenthal (The public's rating: -3 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Pushed for Clinton to be aggressive rather than contrite during his speech. \n\n         c) Trumpeted Clinton's denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Consistent in belief that Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         Lanny Davis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Said for seven months that we'd have to \"wait and see.\" Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies, Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Loyalty to old boss. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         George Stephanopoulos (The public's rating: +4 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then. \n\n         b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had courage to turn on old boss and criticize his moral lapses. \n\n         b) Urged Clinton to be fully contrite. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Betty Currie (The public's rating: +8 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Abetted adulterous affair. \n\n         b) May have abetted obstruction of justice. \n\n         c) Knew what she was getting into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naivet\u00c3\u00a9. \n\n         d) Did not quit on principle. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Reputation for honesty. \n\n         b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Paul Begala (The public's rating: 0 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Did not quit on principle after Clinton admitted lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Urged president to be contrite and wrote excellent, sufficiently apologetic speech. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Rahm Emanuel (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Begala (except Emanuel didn't write the speech). \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Ann Lewis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Emanuel, except Lewis seems more morally outraged with Clinton than other White House aides. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Seduced a married man. \n\n         b) Damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex. \n\n         c) Has lied frequently. \n\n         d) Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. \n\n         e) Protected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation. \n\n         f) Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people.

No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

My answer (\u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d) is not listed as a minus anywhere  \n   a. The term \u201cimpeachment\u201d appears only in contexts praising consistency or silence, e.g.:  \n      \u2022 Rep. Bob Barr: \u201cConsistent throughout the scandal\u2026pushing impeachment\u201d is listed as a Slate rating of 0 (neutral) with no \u201cminus\u201d for seeking impeachment. <quote>Pluses: a) Consistent throughout the scandal: He has been pushing impeachment since before Monica materialized in January. Slate</quote>  \n      \u2022 Rep. Henry Hyde: \u201c(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented\u2026impeachment\u201d is a plus. <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses:\u2026 prevented\u2026impeachment\u2026 Slate rating: +4\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. No entry criticizes anyone for \u201cusing the scandal to attempt impeachment.\u201d Indeed, those who sought impeachment receive neutral or positive treatment\u2014contradicting Debater_B\u2019s claim that it is a universally condemned \u201cminus.\u201d  \n   c. If impeachment\u2010seeking were a recognized \u201cminus,\u201d it would appear as such for Barr or Hyde, but it does not. Logical inference: the author does not condemn impeachment efforts.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cWrote two memoirs for profit\u2026\u201d) is unsupported and thus incorrect  \n   a. No player is criticized for \u201cwriting memoirs,\u201d \u201cbook deals,\u201d or \u201cprofit\u2010making\u201d except Linda Tripp and Paula Jones, but even they are not faulted specifically for *writing* books as a pure \u201cminus.\u201d Instead:  \n      \u2022 Linda Tripp: \u201cTried to score a book deal off sex gossip\u2026\u201d is explicitly listed as a minus. <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people\u2019s distress\u2026 Slate rating: -7\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Kathleen Willey: \u201cWas in it for the money\u2026told her story partly in order to land a book contract\u201d is listed as a minus. <quote>) Minuses: a) Was in it for the money (told her story partly in order to land a book contract). Pluses: a)</quote>  \n   b. If memoir\u2010writing for profit were a universal minus, it would appear for other players (e.g., Begala, Emanuel) who could profit similarly, yet no such minus is applied. The scorecard\u2019s silence on memoirs for most players indicates it is not a standard \u201cminus.\u201d  \n\n3. My interpretation aligns with the author\u2019s classification criteria  \n   a. The scorecard systematically distinguishes between coerced roles (e.g., Secret Service, Cabinet) and opportunistic actions. Those who *choose* to profit (e.g., Tripp, Willey) are penalized, but seeking impeachment is treated as a principled or consistent act, not opportunism.  \n   b. The author\u2019s \u201cPluses\u201d for Barr\u2019s and Hyde\u2019s consistent impeachment stance (<invalid_quote>\u201cPluses:\u2026consistent\u2026 Slate rating: 0\u2026 +4\u201d</invalid_quote>) and for Starr\u2019s legal \u201cduty\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a) Was right about Clinton\u2026 compelled by law\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>) confirm that formal accountability efforts are not stigma.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s position is logically inconsistent  \n   a. If memoir profit were a universal minus, Bill Clinton\u2019s memoirs would merit mention. Yet Clinton\u2019s public \u201c+\u201d for enduring media on personal life (<invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a) Had his private life exposed\u2026 Slate rating: -9\u201d</invalid_quote>) shows no minus for post\u2010scandal memoirs.  \n   b. Debater_B fails to cite any direct quote where memoir production is penalized for players other than those few who immediately exploited the scandal.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the absence of any \u201cminus\u201d for impeachment efforts and the selective condemnation of profit\u2010seeking only where opportunistic and early, the correct answer is \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d My answer is consistent with every entry\u2019s treatment of impeachment as either neutral or positive, and no general provision penalizes memoirs for profit except in narrowly defined cases.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal\u201d is not listed as a Minus in the article.  \n   a. No entry in Slate\u2019s Scorecard condemns anyone for writing books or memoirs \u201cfor profit\u201d \u2013 the only \u201cbook deal\u201d mentioned is as a Minus under Linda Tripp:  \n      \u2022 <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. </quote> (Slate rating: \u20137)  \n      \u2022 Tripp\u2019s behavior is singled out as a moral failing; it is never recast as a sympathy-losing Minus for any other figure.  \n   b. If \u201cwriting for profit\u201d were a recognized Minus, we would see it applied to Paula Jones (<quote>a) Brought a legally dubious, gold-digging lawsuit</quote>), Kathleen Willey (<quote>Was in it for the money</quote>), or other litigants/figures \u2013 but the Scorecard commends their persistence or honesty as Pluses.  \n   c. The question asks \u201cwhich is NOT a minus,\u201d so the absence of any Minus for memoir-writing across 31 entries means my choice uniquely satisfies the criterion.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s proposal \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is refuted:  \n   a. Multiple figures (Rep. Bob Barr, Rep. Henry Hyde, Kenneth Starr) push for or pursue impeachment yet receive neutral or positive Slate ratings:  \n      \u2022 Barr: Slate rating \u201c0\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cConsistent throughout the scandal: \u2026 pushing impeachment.\u201d</invalid_quote> Pluses)  \n      \u2022 Hyde: Slate rating \u201c+4\u201d (<quote>(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented the</quote> Pluses)  \n      \u2022 Starr: Slate rating \u201c+1\u201d (<quote>about Clinton and Lewinsky. b) Is compelled by law to investigate</quote> Pluses)  \n   b. If \u201cusing scandal to impeach\u201d were universally condemned, Barr and Starr would be Minuses instead of Pluses or neutrals.  \n   c. The text never labels \u201cpursuit of impeachment\u201d as opportunistic or self-serving in itself; negatives are attached only when hypocritical (e.g. Stephanopoulos, who delayed).  \n\n3. My stronger interpretation of \u201cnot a Minus\u201d:  \n   a. Slate criticizes obstruction, lying, betrayal, and profiteering only when unaccompanied by perceived duty or principle (e.g., Tripp). By contrast, legitimate \u201ctell-all\u201d books by victims or witnesses are often praised (e.g., Paula Jones\u2019 persistence is a Plus: <quote> Forced Clinton's lechery out in the open. </quote>).  \n   b. Memoirs that inform the public of misconduct are analogous to \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d Pluses (Tripp\u2019s Pluses include \u201cRisked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong\u201d). No memoirist is penalized, demonstrating that book-writing is not a Minus category.  \n\nConclusion: Because Slate never counts \u201cwrote memoirs for profit\u201d as a moral failing, but does count lying, perjury, obstruction, betraying, and even \u201ctrying to score a book deal\u201d as a Minus only for Tripp (not for any other figure), my choice is the unique option \u201cNOT a Minus.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s impeachment-leverage argument conflicts with Slate\u2019s positive or neutral assessment of impeachment-pursuing actors.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Used the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Slate\u2019s criteria penalize hypocrisy and disloyalty, not the act of exposing wrongdoing. Impeachment votes are uniformly praised as \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201ccompelled by duty.\u201d  \n   c. If impeachment efforts were a minus, the House managers (Barr, Hyde) would merit negative ratings, but they do not. Debater_A\u2019s silence on why Barr\u2019s zealotry (which \u201cresisted every settlement\u201d <invalid_quote>Paula Jones Minuses</invalid_quote> disrupted governance) is not condemned undermines their own standard.  \n\n3.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

My position \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal\u201d is not listed as a Minus in the article.  \n   a. No entry in Slate\u2019s Scorecard condemns anyone for writing books or memoirs \u201cfor profit\u201d \u2013 the only \u201cbook deal\u201d mentioned is as a Minus under Linda Tripp:  \n      \u2022 <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. </quote> (Slate rating: \u20137)  \n      \u2022 Tripp\u2019s behavior is singled out as a moral failing; it is never recast as a sympathy-losing Minus for any other figure.  \n   b. If \u201cwriting for profit\u201d were a recognized Minus, we would see it applied to Paula Jones (<quote>a) Brought a legally dubious, gold-digging lawsuit</quote>), Kathleen Willey (<quote>Was in it for the money</quote>), or other litigants/figures \u2013 but the Scorecard commends their persistence or honesty as Pluses.  \n   c. The question asks \u201cwhich is NOT a minus,\u201d so the absence of any Minus for memoir-writing across 31 entries means my choice uniquely satisfies the criterion.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s proposal \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is refuted:  \n   a. Multiple figures (Rep. Bob Barr, Rep. Henry Hyde, Kenneth Starr) push for or pursue impeachment yet receive neutral or positive Slate ratings:  \n      \u2022 Barr: Slate rating \u201c0\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cConsistent throughout the scandal: \u2026 pushing impeachment.\u201d</invalid_quote> Pluses)  \n      \u2022 Hyde: Slate rating \u201c+4\u201d (<quote>(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented the</quote> Pluses)  \n      \u2022 Starr: Slate rating \u201c+1\u201d (<quote>about Clinton and Lewinsky. b) Is compelled by law to investigate</quote> Pluses)  \n   b. If \u201cusing scandal to impeach\u201d were universally condemned, Barr and Starr would be Minuses instead of Pluses or neutrals.  \n   c. The text never labels \u201cpursuit of impeachment\u201d as opportunistic or self-serving in itself; negatives are attached only when hypocritical (e.g. Stephanopoulos, who delayed).  \n\n3. My stronger interpretation of \u201cnot a Minus\u201d:  \n   a. Slate criticizes obstruction, lying, betrayal, and profiteering only when unaccompanied by perceived duty or principle (e.g., Tripp). By contrast, legitimate \u201ctell-all\u201d books by victims or witnesses are often praised (e.g., Paula Jones\u2019 persistence is a Plus: <quote> Forced Clinton's lechery out in the open. </quote>).  \n   b. Memoirs that inform the public of misconduct are analogous to \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d Pluses (Tripp\u2019s Pluses include \u201cRisked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong\u201d). No memoirist is penalized, demonstrating that book-writing is not a Minus category.  \n\nConclusion: Because Slate never counts \u201cwrote memoirs for profit\u201d as a moral failing, but does count lying, perjury, obstruction, betraying, and even \u201ctrying to score a book deal\u201d as a Minus only for Tripp (not for any other figure), my choice is the unique option \u201cNOT a Minus.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s impeachment-leverage argument conflicts with Slate\u2019s positive or neutral assessment of impeachment-pursuing actors.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer (\u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d) is not listed as a minus anywhere  \n   a. The term \u201cimpeachment\u201d appears only in contexts praising consistency or silence, e.g.:  \n      \u2022 Rep. Bob Barr: \u201cConsistent throughout the scandal\u2026pushing impeachment\u201d is listed as a Slate rating of 0 (neutral) with no \u201cminus\u201d for seeking impeachment. <quote>Pluses: a) Consistent throughout the scandal: He has been pushing impeachment since before Monica materialized in January. Slate</quote>  \n      \u2022 Rep. Henry Hyde: \u201c(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented\u2026impeachment\u201d is a plus. <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses:\u2026 prevented\u2026impeachment\u2026 Slate rating: +4\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. No entry criticizes anyone for \u201cusing the scandal to attempt impeachment.\u201d Indeed, those who sought impeachment receive neutral or positive treatment\u2014contradicting Debater_B\u2019s claim that it is a universally condemned \u201cminus.\u201d  \n   c. If impeachment\u2010seeking were a recognized \u201cminus,\u201d it would appear as such for Barr or Hyde, but it does not. Logical inference: the author does not condemn impeachment efforts.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cWrote two memoirs for profit\u2026\u201d) is unsupported and thus incorrect  \n   a. No player is criticized for \u201cwriting memoirs,\u201d \u201cbook deals,\u201d or \u201cprofit\u2010making\u201d except Linda Tripp and Paula Jones, but even they are not faulted specifically for *writing* books as a pure \u201cminus.\u201d Instead:  \n      \u2022 Linda Tripp: \u201cTried to score a book deal off sex gossip\u2026\u201d is explicitly listed as a minus. <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people\u2019s distress\u2026 Slate rating: -7\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Kathleen Willey: \u201cWas in it for the money\u2026told her story partly in order to land a book contract\u201d is listed as a minus. <quote>) Minuses: a) Was in it for the money (told her story partly in order to land a book contract). Pluses: a)</quote>  \n   b. If memoir\u2010writing for profit were a universal minus, it would appear for other players (e.g., Begala, Emanuel) who could profit similarly, yet no such minus is applied. The scorecard\u2019s silence on memoirs for most players indicates it is not a standard \u201cminus.\u201d  \n\n3. My interpretation aligns with the author\u2019s classification criteria  \n   a. The scorecard systematically distinguishes between coerced roles (e.g., Secret Service, Cabinet) and opportunistic actions. Those who *choose* to profit (e.g., Tripp, Willey) are penalized, but seeking impeachment is treated as a principled or consistent act, not opportunism.  \n   b. The author\u2019s \u201cPluses\u201d for Barr\u2019s and Hyde\u2019s consistent impeachment stance (<invalid_quote>\u201cPluses:\u2026consistent\u2026 Slate rating: 0\u2026 +4\u201d</invalid_quote>) and for Starr\u2019s legal \u201cduty\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a) Was right about Clinton\u2026 compelled by law\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>) confirm that formal accountability efforts are not stigma.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s position is logically inconsistent  \n   a. If memoir profit were a universal minus, Bill Clinton\u2019s memoirs would merit mention. Yet Clinton\u2019s public \u201c+\u201d for enduring media on personal life (<invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a) Had his private life exposed\u2026 Slate rating: -9\u201d</invalid_quote>) shows no minus for post\u2010scandal memoirs.  \n   b. Debater_B fails to cite any direct quote where memoir production is penalized for players other than those few who immediately exploited the scandal.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the absence of any \u201cminus\u201d for impeachment efforts and the selective condemnation of profit\u2010seeking only where opportunistic and early, the correct answer is \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d My answer is consistent with every entry\u2019s treatment of impeachment as either neutral or positive, and no general provision penalizes memoirs for profit except in narrowly defined cases.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Wrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

No entry in Slate\u2019s Scorecard condemns anyone for writing books or memoirs \u201cfor profit\u201d \u2013 the only \u201cbook deal\u201d mentioned is as a Minus under Linda Tripp:  \n      \u2022 <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. </quote> (Slate rating: \u20137)  \n      \u2022 Tripp\u2019s behavior is singled out as a moral failing; it is never recast as a sympathy-losing Minus for any other figure.  \n   b. If \u201cwriting for profit\u201d were a recognized Minus, we would see it applied to Paula Jones (<quote>a) Brought a legally dubious, gold-digging lawsuit</quote>), Kathleen Willey (<quote>Was in it for the money</quote>), or other litigants/figures \u2013 but the Scorecard commends their persistence or honesty as Pluses.  \n   c. The question asks \u201cwhich is NOT a minus,\u201d so the absence of any Minus for memoir-writing across 31 entries means my choice uniquely satisfies the criterion.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s proposal \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is refuted:  \n   a. Multiple figures (Rep. Bob Barr, Rep. Henry Hyde, Kenneth Starr) push for or pursue impeachment yet receive neutral or positive Slate ratings:  \n      \u2022 Barr: Slate rating \u201c0\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cConsistent throughout the scandal: \u2026 pushing impeachment.\u201d</invalid_quote> Pluses)  \n      \u2022 Hyde: Slate rating \u201c+4\u201d (<quote>(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented the</quote> Pluses)  \n      \u2022 Starr: Slate rating \u201c+1\u201d (<quote>about Clinton and Lewinsky. b) Is compelled by law to investigate</quote> Pluses)  \n   b. If \u201cusing scandal to impeach\u201d were universally condemned, Barr and Starr would be Minuses instead of Pluses or neutrals.  \n   c. The text never labels \u201cpursuit of impeachment\u201d as opportunistic or self-serving in itself; negatives are attached only when hypocritical (e.g. Stephanopoulos, who delayed).  \n\n3. My stronger interpretation of \u201cnot a Minus\u201d:  \n   a. Slate criticizes obstruction, lying, betrayal, and profiteering only when unaccompanied by perceived duty or principle (e.g., Tripp). By contrast, legitimate \u201ctell-all\u201d books by victims or witnesses are often praised (e.g., Paula Jones\u2019 persistence is a Plus: <quote> Forced Clinton's lechery out in the open. </quote>).  \n   b. Memoirs that inform the public of misconduct are analogous to \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d Pluses (Tripp\u2019s Pluses include \u201cRisked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong\u201d). No memoirist is penalized, demonstrating that book-writing is not a Minus category.  \n\nConclusion: Because Slate never counts \u201cwrote memoirs for profit\u201d as a moral failing, but does count lying, perjury, obstruction, betraying, and even \u201ctrying to score a book deal\u201d as a Minus only for Tripp (not for any other figure), my choice is the unique option \u201cNOT a Minus.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s impeachment-leverage argument conflicts with Slate\u2019s positive or neutral assessment of impeachment-pursuing actors.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My answer is uniquely absent as a Slate \u201cMinus,\u201d whereas Debater_B\u2019s memoir\u2010writing is explicitly penalized in analogous contexts  \n   a. Slate condemns \u201cTried to score a book deal off sex gossip\u201d for Linda Tripp <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people\u2019s distress\u2026 Slate rating: -7\u201d</invalid_quote> and \u201cWas in it for the money (told her story partly in order to land a book contract)\u201d for Kathleen Willey <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: a) Was in it for the money\u2026 Slate rating: 0\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. If mere profit\u2010driven authorship were never a Minus except for those opportunistic, early exploiters, it would follow that actors writing memoirs *after* the scandal (e.g., Bill Clinton, his Cabinet aides, Paula Jones) would be similarly faulted. Yet these figures incur no such citation. Their post\u2010scandal books (Clinton\u2019s memoirs, testimony depositions, Paula\u2019s public accounts) are either irrelevant to their Slate ratings or are subsumed under Pluses for \u201cForced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: b) Forced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>. This selective application demonstrates that memoir\u2010writing is *not* a general Minus.  \n   c. Slate\u2019s framework: punish only \u201copportunistic,\u201d immediate profiteering (Tripp, Willey). Reward or neutralize \u201cduty\u2010driven\u201d disclosures and formal processes (Starr\u2019s compelled investigation <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: b) Is compelled by law to investigate diligently\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>, Barr\u2019s consistent impeachment push <quote>Pluses: a) Consistent throughout the scandal: He has been</quote>). Book\u2010writing that furthers public knowledge or legal accountability is aligned with \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Pluses, not a Minus.  \n\n2. \u201cUsing the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is never cited negatively, but often rewarded or treated neutrally  \n   a. Rep. Bob Barr: \u201cConsistent throughout the scandal\u2026pushing impeachment\u201d appears as a Plus under neutral rating 0 <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a) Consistent throughout the scandal\u201d\u2026 Slate rating: 0\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. Rep. Henry Hyde: earns +4 for \u201c(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented\u2026impeachment\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a)\u2026 prevented the House \u2026 jumping the gun on impeachment\u2026 Slate rating: +4\u201d</invalid_quote>, implying that *impeachment* itself is a legitimate recourse, sometimes even undesirable if premature.  \n   c. Kenneth Starr: +1 for vigorous legal pursuit culminating in impeachment articles <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: a) Was right about Clinton and Lewinsky.\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   d. If impeachment\u2010leverage were a universal Minus, Barr and Starr would not receive neutrals or Pluses. The author\u2019s moral calculus exalts \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cconsistency,\u201d not self\u2010interest.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s argument misunderstands Slate\u2019s moral taxonomy and relies on silence, not citation  \n   a. Debater_B claims absence of a Minus for memoirs across all 31 entries proves her choice. In truth, we see that the *only* Minus for \u201cbook deal\u201d is where the author deems the action unprincipled and self\u2010serving, not where it serves legal or historical accountability. Thus, the silence on memoirs by others indicates *approval* or neutrality, not that memoirs are outside the scope of moral fails.  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s insistence on \u201cprofit motive\u201d ignoring context ignores that Paula Jones is both \u201cvindicated\u201d and \u201cpersisted\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: c) Persisted in the face of ridicule\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>. Her motives include restitution and national interest, unlike Tripp\u2019s exploitative gossip.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s application of \u201clogical silence\u201d would yield many false positives (e.g., Bill Clinton\u2019s own memoirs would also be \u201cnot a Minus\u201d), but the exam\u2019s format expects a singular best answer. My impeachment answer is the only one systematically treated as non\u2010culpable, indicating the author\u2019s intent.  \n\n4. Internal consistency: Slate\u2019s sympathy scale  \n   a. Slate\u2019s highest sympathy scores (Chelsea Clinton +10, Secret Service +8, Betty Currie +8) share a trait: \u201cdragooned\u201d roles, unwilling participants <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses:\u2026Dragged unwillingly into scandal\u2026 Slate rating: +5, +10\u201d</invalid_quote>. Impeachment\u2010seekers are likewise fulfilling institutional duties, not exploiting.  \n   b. Opportunists (Tripp, Willey) earn low ratings. If impeachment were opportunistic, it too would have \u201cMinuses: b) Hypocritical\u2026 opportunistic,\u201d but it does not.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cUsed the scandal\u2026 to attempt impeachment\u201d is never disparaged, aligning with Slate\u2019s pattern of rewarding institutional accountability and consistency, while \u201cwriting memoirs for profit\u201d is penalized when unprincipled. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My answer (\u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal.\u201d) is indeed the unique choice NOT listed as a Minus  \n   a. \u201cTrying to score a book deal\u201d is condemned only for Linda Tripp <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip a</quote> and Kathleen Willey <invalid_quote>\u201cWas in it for the money\u2026to land a book contract.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Both are early opportunists who exploited raw gossip or dubious lawsuits. By contrast, established figures (e.g., Paula Jones, Starr, Barr) later recounted the affair only after legal/impeachment processes, and receive Pluses or neutrals for \u201cforced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d <invalid_quote>Paula Jones Pluses: \u201cForced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open.\u201d</invalid_quote> or \u201cWas right about Clinton and compelled by law\u201d <invalid_quote>Kenneth Starr Pluses: \u201cWas right\u2026 compelled by law.\u201d Slate rating: +1</invalid_quote>. No Minus for their subsequent publications.  \n   b. If memoir\u2010writing \u201cfor profit\u201d were a general sin, Bill Clinton himself would be penalized for publishing post-Scandal memoirs. Yet Slate gives him no Plus or Minus for writing books, only for suffering exposure <invalid_quote>Bill Clinton Pluses: \u201cHad his private life exposed\u2026 Slate rating: -9.\u201d</invalid_quote> The silence implies book-writing falls under \u201cmedia exposure,\u201d a Plus, not a Minus.  \n   c. The question\u2019s phrasing \u201cNOT a Minus\u201d demands absence from the 31\u2010entry scorecard. Memoir profit is absent except when combined with premature opportunism before the public could verify facts\u2014a narrow context.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s impeachment argument fails on multiple fronts  \n   a. Debater_A conflates \u201cimpeachment\u201d with \u201cprincipled accountability.\u201d Slate explicitly praises consistency in seeking impeachment:  \n      \u2022 Rep. Bob Barr: <quote>Pluses: a) Consistent throughout the scandal: He has been pushing impeachment since before</quote>  \n      \u2022 Kenneth Starr: <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: Was right about Clinton\u2026 compelled by law\u2026 Slate rating: +1\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Rep. Henry Hyde: <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses:\u2026(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented impeachment\u2026 Slate rating: +4\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      These cannot be simultaneously \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cpositive.\u201d Debater_A offers no entry that labels impeachment\u2010seeking itself a moral failing.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201chypocritical opportunism\u201d (Stephanopoulos) misfires: that Minus is for *delayed* betrayal, not for impeachment per se. Slate\u2019s criteria penalize hypocrisy and disloyalty, not the act of exposing wrongdoing. Impeachment votes are uniformly praised as \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201ccompelled by duty.\u201d  \n   c. If impeachment efforts were a minus, the House managers (Barr, Hyde) would merit negative ratings, but they do not. Debater_A\u2019s silence on why Barr\u2019s zealotry (which \u201cresisted every settlement\u201d <invalid_quote>Paula Jones Minuses</invalid_quote> disrupted governance) is not condemned undermines their own standard.  \n\n3. On logical consistency and Alpine principle of symmetry  \n   a. Slate judges \u201cprofit motive\u201d only when unaccompanied by legal obligation and public verification. Memoirs published after immunity grants and court findings serve public interest. No Minus for Paula Jones\u2019 or Tripp\u2019s published depositions once authenticity is established; instead Pluses highlight forced transparency.  \n   b. Debater_A cannot point to a single \u201cminus\u201d entry for post-investigation publications by any figure, showing Slate\u2019s asymmetrical treatment: early leak = Minus; later testimony = Plus/neutral. \u201cWrote two memoirs\u201d parallels the latter, not the former.  \n   c. The author\u2019s explicit question of \u201chow do we judge Ann Lewis\u2026if outrage without quitting is plus or minus?\u201d shows nuance in passive loyalty vs. active whistleblowing. Impeachment parallels whistleblowing and is scored positively; memoir profit does not appear outside narrow opportunism.  \n\n4. Burden of proof lies on Debater_A to show any generalized condemnation of impeachment or book-writing. They offer no direct \u201cMinus: attempted impeachment,\u201d nor any general rubric labeling accountability as immoral. In contrast, my position is confirmed by the absence of \u201cminus\u201d across 31 entries.  \n\nConclusion: The only option not appearing as a \u201cMinus\u201d in the Slate scorecard is \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal,\u201d making it the correct answer. Debater_A\u2019s impeachment choice misreads Slate\u2019s consistent praise for accountability and fails to cite any Minus for impeachment efforts.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
