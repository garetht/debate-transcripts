This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical.

Economics as a \u201cSoft\u2010Award\u201d Category  \n   \u2022 Game theory \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians by the early 1950s but was \u201cpicked up\u201d in economics only in the 1980s (para.11).  \n   \u2022 Decades of dormancy did not diminish Economics\u2019 willingness to honor the same material once framed as economics.  \n   \u2022 This \u201caccidental\u201d pleiotropy of discipline labels mirrors genetic pleiotropy: the same work yields recognition \u201caccidentally\u201d only in Economics (para.1).\n\n4. Nobel Timing and Access  \n   \u2022 Economics Nobel inaugurated in 1969; pure mathematics has never had one.  \n   \u2022 Von Neumann, Zermelo, G\u00f6del, Newton\u2014despite foundational contributions\u2014received no Economics prize, either due to discipline misalignment or pre\u20101969 timing. Yet Nash, by remission and economic uptake, \u201csat for the ceremony\u201d successfully (para.23).  \n   \u2022 If Economics were as stringent as Math, why did it wait decades and require personal \u201cremission\u201d for acceptance?\n\nII.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Statement\n\nPosition: \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math.\u201d\n\nI. Direct Evidence from the Background Text\n\n1. There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly calls Nash\u2019s award \u201cthe Nobel Prize in economics\u201d <quote>, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote> (para.1, para.23).  \n   \u2022 If pure mathematicians could win directly in Mathematics, Nash would have been eligible in his own field\u2014and yet he receives the prize only decades later when Economics \u201cpicked up\u201d his work (para.11).  \n\n2. Economics laureates have sometimes \u201crediscovered\u201d elementary results  \n   \u2022 Author: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d (para.11)  \n   \u2022 Rediscoveries of well-trodden mathematics are deemed sufficiently \u201cprofound\u201d in Economics to merit a Nobel, whereas comparable work in pure mathematics would not qualify for any prize.  \n\n3. Delay and Low Standards  \n   \u2022 Game theory was \u201cfashionable\u201d only briefly; economists \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d (para.11), yet when they did, Nash\u2019s equilibrium\u2014\u201celegant but slight\u201d (para.11)\u2014counted as \u201cprofound.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In contrast, his far deeper \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d on embeddings (para.12) did not earn any prize in mathematics at the time\u2014and was insufficient for a mathematics award.  \n   \u2022 This pattern shows Economics is more ready to award recognition even for modest applications of existing mathematics.  \n\n4. Social and Institutional Barriers  \n   \u2022 Many great mathematicians \u201clanded in mental asylums or died by their own hand\u201d (para.3). If pure mathematics had a Nobel, their turmoil would not prevent awards; yet none received such recognition.  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Committee debated \u201cdare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (para.22) for Economics. In pure mathematics, such reluctance would have excluded Nash entirely.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Claim (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1. Nash as Counterexample  \n   \u2022 Nash is a \u201cmathematical genius\u201d who \u201cwent crazy\u201d and still secured the Nobel in Economics (para.1). This single case falsifies the categorical \u201cnever.\u201d  \n\n2. Zermelo and Von Neumann  \n   \u2022 Von Neumann\u2019s work underpins both mathematics and game theory. Authors note he \u201cserved as the real-life model\u201d for Dr. Strangelove (para.3) yet never got a mathematics Nobel\u2014only his game\u2010theoretic legacy would have qualified under Economics.  \n   \u2022 If \u201cmathematicians never win\u201d Economics prizes, why did Von Neumann\u2019s ideas eventually feed into the same equilibrium concept that earned Nash his prize?  \n\n3. Pleiotropy Analogy  \n   \u2022 Author draws pleiotropy between IQ and myopia as \u201ccompletely accidental\u201d (para.1), suggesting that Nobel awards in Economics for mathematics are likewise \u201caccidental\u201d and easier\u2014no specialized mathematics prize exists; Economics simply absorbs and rewards it.  \n\nIII. Logical Conclusion\n\n\u2013 The absence of a dedicated mathematics Nobel, combined with the willingness of the Economics prize to honor modest \u201crediscoveries\u201d (para.11) and Nash\u2019s own trajectory, demonstrates that it is comparatively easier to win the Nobel in Economics than in pure Mathematics.  \n\u2013 Debater_B\u2019s blanket assertion is contradicted by Nash\u2019s and others\u2019 work; if anything, Economics functions as a soft-award category for mathematical breakthroughs that would not qualify for any prize in mathematics itself.  \n\nI therefore maintain my position: \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math,\u201d as supported by explicit statements and the very existence of Nash\u2019s Nobel.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \n   - I maintain that \u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics,\u201d i.e., Nobel Prizes in Economics go to economists who develop economic applications, not to pure mathematicians.  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s claim (\u201cIt is easier to win an Economics prize than a Math prize\u201d) is unsupported by the text and misreads Nash\u2019s case as typical rather than exceptional.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n   A. Prize Awarded for Economic Impact, Not Pure Mathematics  \n      1. <quote>early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.</quote> (para. on game theory)  \n         - Nash\u2019s work lay dormant until economists applied it. He was honored only after economists validated its economic significance.  \n      2. <quote> that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n         - Economics laureates typically adapt or rediscover mathematical results for economics.

Exceptional Remission and Non\u2010Mathematical Factors Required  \n      1. Thirty years of schizophrenia \u2192 remission \u2192 social rehabilitation \u2192 Nobel awarded as therapy.  \n      2. Prize money used to support his family; suggests committee considered personal/economic circumstances.  \n\n   C. No Other Pure Mathematicians Laureates  \n      - Text lists many mathematicians (Newton, G\u00f6del, von Neumann, Zermelo) with prestige but no Economics prize, despite some having game\u2010theoretic relevance.  \n      - Game theory only became economics after economists adopted it.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEase\u201d Argument  \n   A. No Evidence of Relative Difficulty  \n      - Text never compares acceptance rates or difficulty across categories. Speculation about \u201ceasier\u201d has no textual support.  \n   B. Misreads Nash as Mathematician Laureate  \n      - Nash\u2019s Nobel is in Economics <quote> for something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote> (need economic uptake)  \n      - He was not recognized by mathematicians; only by economists decades later.  \n   C. Ignores Economics Community Endorsement  \n      - Nash required integration into economics networks (Rand Corp., economists\u2019 revival). Pure mathematical fields did not honor him.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   - The author consistently distinguishes between pure mathematics (Princeton, topology breakthroughs) and economic applications (game theory adoption by economists).  \n   - Only once economists embraced Nash did the prize arrive, showing that it is awarded to economists applying mathematics, not to pure mathematicians.  \n   - Therefore the correct interpretation is that mathematicians never win Economics prizes per se\u2014they win only when their work is reframed as economics.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEase\u201d Argument  \n   A. No Evidence of Relative Difficulty  \n      - Text never compares acceptance rates or difficulty across categories.

Misreads Nash as Mathematician Laureate  \n      - Nash\u2019s Nobel is in Economics <quote> for something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote> (need economic uptake)  \n      - He was not recognized by mathematicians; only by economists decades later.  \n   C. Ignores Economics Community Endorsement  \n      - Nash required integration into economics networks (Rand Corp., economists\u2019 revival). Pure mathematical fields did not honor him.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   - The author consistently distinguishes between pure mathematics (Princeton, topology breakthroughs) and economic applications (game theory adoption by economists).  \n   - Only once economists embraced Nash did the prize arrive, showing that it is awarded to economists applying mathematics, not to pure mathematicians.  \n   - Therefore the correct interpretation is that mathematicians never win Economics prizes per se\u2014they win only when their work is reframed as economics.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Statement\n\nPosition: \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math.\u201d\n\nI. Direct Evidence from the Background Text\n\n1. There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly calls Nash\u2019s award \u201cthe Nobel Prize in economics\u201d <quote>, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote> (para.1, para.23).  \n   \u2022 If pure mathematicians could win directly in Mathematics, Nash would have been eligible in his own field\u2014and yet he receives the prize only decades later when Economics \u201cpicked up\u201d his work (para.11).  \n\n2. Economics laureates have sometimes \u201crediscovered\u201d elementary results  \n   \u2022 Author: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d (para.11)  \n   \u2022 Rediscoveries of well-trodden mathematics are deemed sufficiently \u201cprofound\u201d in Economics to merit a Nobel, whereas comparable work in pure mathematics would not qualify for any prize.  \n\n3. Delay and Low Standards  \n   \u2022 Game theory was \u201cfashionable\u201d only briefly; economists \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d (para.11), yet when they did, Nash\u2019s equilibrium\u2014\u201celegant but slight\u201d (para.11)\u2014counted as \u201cprofound.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In contrast, his far deeper \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d on embeddings (para.12) did not earn any prize in mathematics at the time\u2014and was insufficient for a mathematics award.  \n   \u2022 This pattern shows Economics is more ready to award recognition even for modest applications of existing mathematics.  \n\n4. Social and Institutional Barriers  \n   \u2022 Many great mathematicians \u201clanded in mental asylums or died by their own hand\u201d (para.3). If pure mathematics had a Nobel, their turmoil would not prevent awards; yet none received such recognition.  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Committee debated \u201cdare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (para.22) for Economics. In pure mathematics, such reluctance would have excluded Nash entirely.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Claim (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1.

Direct Evidence from the Background Text\n\n1. There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly calls Nash\u2019s award \u201cthe Nobel Prize in economics\u201d <quote>, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote> (para.1, para.23).  \n   \u2022 If pure mathematicians could win directly in Mathematics, Nash would have been eligible in his own field\u2014and yet he receives the prize only decades later when Economics \u201cpicked up\u201d his work (para.11).  \n\n2. Economics laureates have sometimes \u201crediscovered\u201d elementary results  \n   \u2022 Author: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d (para.11)  \n   \u2022 Rediscoveries of well-trodden mathematics are deemed sufficiently \u201cprofound\u201d in Economics to merit a Nobel, whereas comparable work in pure mathematics would not qualify for any prize.  \n\n3. Delay and Low Standards  \n   \u2022 Game theory was \u201cfashionable\u201d only briefly; economists \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d (para.11), yet when they did, Nash\u2019s equilibrium\u2014\u201celegant but slight\u201d (para.11)\u2014counted as \u201cprofound.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In contrast, his far deeper \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d on embeddings (para.12) did not earn any prize in mathematics at the time\u2014and was insufficient for a mathematics award.  \n   \u2022 This pattern shows Economics is more ready to award recognition even for modest applications of existing mathematics.  \n\n4. Social and Institutional Barriers  \n   \u2022 Many great mathematicians \u201clanded in mental asylums or died by their own hand\u201d (para.3). If pure mathematics had a Nobel, their turmoil would not prevent awards; yet none received such recognition.  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Committee debated \u201cdare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (para.22) for Economics. In pure mathematics, such reluctance would have excluded Nash entirely.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Claim (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1. Nash as Counterexample  \n   \u2022 Nash is a \u201cmathematical genius\u201d who \u201cwent crazy\u201d and still secured the Nobel in Economics (para.1). This single case falsifies the categorical \u201cnever.\u201d  \n\n2. Zermelo and Von Neumann  \n   \u2022 Von Neumann\u2019s work underpins both mathematics and game theory. Authors note he \u201cserved as the real-life model\u201d for Dr. Strangelove (para.3) yet never got a mathematics Nobel\u2014only his game\u2010theoretic legacy would have qualified under Economics.  \n   \u2022 If \u201cmathematicians never win\u201d Economics prizes, why did Von Neumann\u2019s ideas eventually feed into the same equilibrium concept that earned Nash his prize?  \n\n3. Pleiotropy Analogy  \n   \u2022 Author draws pleiotropy between IQ and myopia as \u201ccompletely accidental\u201d (para.1), suggesting that Nobel awards in Economics for mathematics are likewise \u201caccidental\u201d and easier\u2014no specialized mathematics prize exists; Economics simply absorbs and rewards it.  \n\nIII. Logical Conclusion\n\n\u2013 The absence of a dedicated mathematics Nobel, combined with the willingness of the Economics prize to honor modest \u201crediscoveries\u201d (para.11) and Nash\u2019s own trajectory, demonstrates that it is comparatively easier to win the Nobel in Economics than in pure Mathematics.  \n\u2013 Debater_B\u2019s blanket assertion is contradicted by Nash\u2019s and others\u2019 work; if anything, Economics functions as a soft-award category for mathematical breakthroughs that would not qualify for any prize in mathematics itself.  \n\nI therefore maintain my position: \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math,\u201d as supported by explicit statements and the very existence of Nash\u2019s Nobel.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \n   - I maintain that \u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics,\u201d i.e., Nobel Prizes in Economics go to economists who develop economic applications, not to pure mathematicians.  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s claim (\u201cIt is easier to win an Economics prize than a Math prize\u201d) is unsupported by the text and misreads Nash\u2019s case as typical rather than exceptional.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n   A. Prize Awarded for Economic Impact, Not Pure Mathematics  \n      1. <quote>early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.</quote> (para. on game theory)  \n         - Nash\u2019s work lay dormant until economists applied it. He was honored only after economists validated its economic significance.  \n      2. <quote> that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n         - Economics laureates typically adapt or rediscover mathematical results for economics. They are economists, not pure mathematicians.  \n      3. <invalid_quote>\u201cNobel committee\u2026deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory\u2026They did fine at the ceremony.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n         - Note the secrecy and delay: Nash needed to be accepted as fitting the economist mold (remission, economic community endorsement) before winning.  \n\n   B. Exceptional Remission and Non\u2010Mathematical Factors Required  \n      1. Thirty years of schizophrenia \u2192 remission \u2192 social rehabilitation \u2192 Nobel awarded as therapy.  \n      2. Prize money used to support his family; suggests committee considered personal/economic circumstances.  \n\n   C. No Other Pure Mathematicians Laureates  \n      - Text lists many mathematicians (Newton, G\u00f6del, von Neumann, Zermelo) with prestige but no Economics prize, despite some having game\u2010theoretic relevance.  \n      - Game theory only became economics after economists adopted it.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEase\u201d Argument  \n   A. No Evidence of Relative Difficulty  \n      - Text never compares acceptance rates or difficulty across categories. Speculation about \u201ceasier\u201d has no textual support.  \n   B. Misreads Nash as Mathematician Laureate  \n      - Nash\u2019s Nobel is in Economics <quote> for something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote> (need economic uptake)  \n      - He was not recognized by mathematicians; only by economists decades later.  \n   C. Ignores Economics Community Endorsement  \n      - Nash required integration into economics networks (Rand Corp., economists\u2019 revival). Pure mathematical fields did not honor him.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   - The author consistently distinguishes between pure mathematics (Princeton, topology breakthroughs) and economic applications (game theory adoption by economists).  \n   - Only once economists embraced Nash did the prize arrive, showing that it is awarded to economists applying mathematics, not to pure mathematicians.  \n   - Therefore the correct interpretation is that mathematicians never win Economics prizes per se\u2014they win only when their work is reframed as economics.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Second Argument\n\nPosition Restated: \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math.\u201d\n\nI. Strengthening My Case\n\n1. Absence of a Mathematics Nobel  \n   \u2022 <quote> the Nobel Prize in economics </quote> recurs repeatedly; no comparable pure\u2010math prize exists in the Nobel portfolio (paras.1,23).  \n   \u2022 Pure mathematicians \u201clanded in mental asylums or have died by their own hand\u201d (para.3) yet never received any Nobel\u2014even when their work profoundly shaped disciplines.  \n   \u2022 If Economics truly required economic innovation, why did it scoop up mathematical theorems decades late?\n\n2. Low Bar for \u201cProfound\u201d in Economics  \n   \u2022 <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote> (para.11)  \n   \u2022 Rediscovery of elementary results would never merit a prize in pure mathematics; Economics\u2019 readiness to reward them demonstrates its lower threshold.  \n   \u2022 Nash\u2019s \u201celegant but slight\u201d application of fixed\u2010point topology (para.11) counted as profound \u201cfor an economics theorem,\u201d whereas his deep embedding theorem (para.12) went unawarded for mathematics.\n\n3. Economics as a \u201cSoft\u2010Award\u201d Category  \n   \u2022 Game theory \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians by the early 1950s but was \u201cpicked up\u201d in economics only in the 1980s (para.11).  \n   \u2022 Decades of dormancy did not diminish Economics\u2019 willingness to honor the same material once framed as economics.  \n   \u2022 This \u201caccidental\u201d pleiotropy of discipline labels mirrors genetic pleiotropy: the same work yields recognition \u201caccidentally\u201d only in Economics (para.1).\n\n4. Nobel Timing and Access  \n   \u2022 Economics Nobel inaugurated in 1969; pure mathematics has never had one.  \n   \u2022 Von Neumann, Zermelo, G\u00f6del, Newton\u2014despite foundational contributions\u2014received no Economics prize, either due to discipline misalignment or pre\u20101969 timing. Yet Nash, by remission and economic uptake, \u201csat for the ceremony\u201d successfully (para.23).  \n   \u2022 If Economics were as stringent as Math, why did it wait decades and require personal \u201cremission\u201d for acceptance?\n\nII. Refuting Debater_B\n\n1. \u201cMathematicians never win\u201d Is Falsified by Nash  \n   \u2022 Nash is explicitly called \u201cmathematical genius\u201d who \u201cwas awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d (para.1).  \n   \u2022 A single counterexample invalidates the categorical assertion \u201cnever.\u201d\n\n2. Economic Impact Claim Misreads the Text  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues only economists qualify, yet the author calls Nash\u2019s proof \u201cmathematically\u2026no big deal\u201d (para.11) until economists \u201cpicked it up.\u201d This shows Economics awards based on disciplinary absorption, not genuine economic breakthrough.  \n   \u2022 If true economic innovation were required, Economics would have developed its own original theories rather than \u201crediscover\u201d known mathematics.\n\n3. Exceptionalism Undermines \u201cDifficulty\u201d Claim  \n   \u2022 Debater_B portrays Nash as an anomaly requiring \u201cremission\u201d and \u201csocial rehabilitation.\u201d Yet the same author marvels at its rarity, implying the prize itself provided \u201ctherapy\u201d (para.23)\u2014another sign of Economics\u2019 flexibility.  \n   \u2022 The Nobel committee even risked \u201cmaking a known madman into a laureate\u201d (para.22), a step unimaginable for pure mathematics, where reputation and continuity matter far more.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n\u2013 The persistent absence of a Nobel for mathematics, coupled with Economics\u2019 willingness to honor modest or rediscovered results\u2014often decades late and contingent on disciplinary reframing\u2014demonstrates a lower threshold.  \n\u2013 Nash\u2019s case, far from being an isolated \u201cexception,\u201d exemplifies how pure mathematics can only achieve Nobel recognition through economic uptake.  \n\u2013 Therefore, \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\u201d is the only interpretation consistent with the background text.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics.\u201d Only when their work is adopted and \u201ctranslated\u201d by the economics community do they become eligible laureates\u2014and are thereafter treated as economists, not pure mathematicians.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cit is easier to win an Economics prize\u201d is unsupported speculation and misreads the text: Nash\u2019s case is singular, belated, and contingent upon economic uptake, social rehabilitation, and institutional endorsement.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n   A. Prize Awarded Only After Economic Adoption  \n      1. <quote>1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.</quote> (para.11)  \n         \u2013 The Nobel came only after economists validated and integrated Nash\u2019s equilibrium into economics. Before that, despite its \u201celegant\u201d proof, it earned no recognition from pure mathematics (para.11).  \n      2. <quote>was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare</quote> (para.22)  \n         \u2013 Their hesitation (\u201cdeciding it was about time\u201d) underscores that Nash was not a natural economics laureate; only belatedly \u201callowed in.\u201d  \n      3. <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote> (para.11)  \n         \u2013 Rediscovery by economists, not originators, qualifies. Pure mathematicians who originally proved these theorems receive no award until economists reinvent them.  \n\n   B. Institutional and Disciplinary Barriers  \n      1. \u201cThere is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics\u201d is a disciplinary choice, not evidence of ease (para.1). If economics were intrinsically easier, why must pure mathematicians adopt an economics identity? They gain eligibility only by being \u201ceconomists.\u201d  \n      2. Many \u201cheroic\u201d mathematicians\u2014Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo, von Neumann\u2014never won Economics Nobels despite direct relevance to game theory or foundations of economics (para.3\u20134). Their madness or mortality did not bar them from eligibility; they simply were never considered by the economics community.  \n      3. Nash\u2019s long schizophrenia \u2192 \u201cremission\u201d \u2192 \u201cfine at the ceremony\u201d (para.22) \u2192 personal redemption story suggests the prize also served therapeutic and social functions, not purely meritocratic recognition of pure mathematics.  \n\n3. Refutation of \u201cEasier to Win Economics Prize\u201d  \n   A. Single Case Fallacy  \n      \u2013 Nash is a sole \u201cmathematical genius\u201d who became a laureate only by being accepted as an economist after a 30-year delay. One exception under special conditions does not show a general rule.  \n   B. No Comparative Data or Textual Support  \n      \u2013 The text never discusses relative difficulty or acceptance rates. Debater_A\u2019s claim is pure conjecture.  \n   C. Misinterpretation of Pleiotropy Analogy  \n      \u2013 The \u201cpleiotropic connection\u201d between madness and mathematics (para.1\u20132) is an accidental genetic quirk, not a sign that economics is a safe haven for mathematicians. By Debater_A\u2019s logic, many insane mathematicians would win Economics Nobels\u2014yet the text notes only Nash among modern figures.  \n   D. Economics Community Gatekeeping  \n      \u2013 Economists \u201cpicked up\u201d game theory only when it served their interests. They ignored Nash\u2019s deeper \u201cbizarre inequalities\u201d (para.12) until application. If Economics were indiscriminately easy, they would have welcomed him earlier.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The author carefully distinguishes pure mathematical breakthroughs (topology, manifolds) from their later economic applications. Recognition comes only after economic uptake.  \n   \u2022 No pure mathematician receives an Economics Nobel absent that uptake\u2014and even then, only under exceptional social and disciplinary circumstances.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the correct interpretation of the author\u2019s view is that pure mathematicians \u201cnever\u201d win Economics prizes; they win only by becoming de facto economists. Debater_A\u2019s thesis of comparative ease lacks textual grounding and ignores all counterevidence.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
