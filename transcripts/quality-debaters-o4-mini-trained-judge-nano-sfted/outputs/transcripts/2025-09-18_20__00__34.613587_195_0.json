Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s primary\u2014and most consequential\u2014function in the piece is to intercept illicit White House activities via informants and to serve as the whistleblower, mobilizing Independent Counsel and public opinion.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment proceedings and his later resignation are downstream consequences, not the core of his dramatic purpose.  \n   \u2022 Thus \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\u201d best captures his role.",

Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cImpeachment-Organizer\u201d Position  \n   4.1 Chicken-and-egg problem  \n     \u2022 Without the intercepted tapes and partisan leaks, there would be no grounds to \u201corganize impeachment.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A ignores the musical\u2019s depiction of GOP-sponsored surveillance as the spark.  \n   4.2 Ineffectiveness of impeachment  \n     \u2022 The final song \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Gingrich\u2019s impeachment drive fails (\u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If his only contribution were impeachment, his role is ultimately futile and dismissible, contradicting the notion of a \u201ccentral\u201d organizing function.  \n   4.3 Label \u201cConspiracy\u201d indicates active, covert initiation  \n     \u2022 The term \u201cconspiracy\u201d connotes secret engagement prior to any formal proceedings, consistent with interception, not mere public hearings.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s primary\u2014and most consequential\u2014function in the piece is to intercept illicit White House activities via informants and to serve as the whistleblower, mobilizing Independent Counsel and public opinion.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment proceedings and his later resignation are downstream consequences, not the core of his dramatic purpose.  \n   \u2022 Thus \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\u201d best captures his role.",

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Newt Gingrich\u2019s role is to lead the impeachment effort against President Clinton and ultimately to suffer political defeat and resign\u2014not to serve as any \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or initial \u201cinterceptor\u201d of the affair.\n\n2. Claim A \u2013 Gingrich Only Acts After Scandal Becomes Public  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d (Background) shows Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg conspiring to record Monica. There is no mention of Gingrich or any action by him to \u201cblow the whistle.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cI Never Have\u201d (Background) describes Starr\u2019s and the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation and Clinton\u2019s repeated denials. Again, Gingrich is absent until impeachment.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d (Background) and Clinton\u2019s public apology precede any mention of impeachment. Gingrich could not impeach what he had not yet \u201cintercepted.\u201d\n\n3. Claim B \u2013 Gingrich\u2019s Explicit \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d Number Is Impeachment Strategy  \n   \u2022 In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d Gingrich sings  \n       <invalid_quote>\u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u2026Must remember to remain sober\u2026Bring \u2019em down\u2026Now, like charging linemen, we\u2019ll move in for the sack\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     (Background)  \n     \u2013 This is an explicit call to impeach (i.e., \u201cmove in for the sack\u201d).  \n   \u2022 He references pinning charges on Gore (\u201cLet\u2019s remember to pin some stuff on Gore\u201d), showing he\u2019s organizing a broad removal strategy, not simply \u201creporting evidence.\u201d\n\n4. Claim C \u2013 Gingrich Pays the Political Price  \n   \u2022 \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Starr lamenting only getting Newt\u2019s scalp.  \n     <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d proves Gingrich becomes the victim, not the triumphant whistleblower. He is forced to resign, indicating his impeachment campaign backfired.\n\n5. Objection to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Debater_B incorrectly credits Gingrich with originating the scandal. All evidence of recording and legal action comes from Tripp, Goldberg, Starr, and Monica\u2019s own disclosure (\u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d; \u201cI Never Have\u201d).  \n   \u2022 If Gingrich were the interceptor, we would see an earlier song or scene featuring him collaborating with Tripp/Goldberg or delivering evidence. No such scene exists before impeachment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s interpretation ignores the central dramatic arc: Gingrich\u2019s midterm electoral defeat and forced resignation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d), which makes no sense if he had succeeded in blowing the whistle. Whistleblowers normally emerge vindicated; Gingrich emerges disgraced.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   All direct evidence from the text positions Newt Gingrich as the Republican leader pressing forward impeachment (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d), only to see midterm voters repudiate scandal-mongering and force his resignation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d). He is not the whistleblower\u2014he is the impeacher who pays the price.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition  \n   \u2022 I assert Newt Gingrich\u2019s central role is as the initial interceptor of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair and chief whistleblower\u2014launching the scandal\u2014rather than merely organizing impeachment afterward.  \n\n2. Evidence He Intercepts and Whistleblows  \n   2.1 \u201cVast right-wing conspiracy\u201d lyric invokes a coordinated GOP smear campaign:  \n     \u2022 CLINTON: \u201cA vast right-wing conspiracy / Is using her [Monica] to beat on me\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote>.  \n     \u2022 As Speaker, Gingrich is the leader of that \u201cconspiracy,\u201d directing party resources to expose Clinton\u2019s relationship.  \n   2.2 Role of GOP figures working through Linda Tripp and Independent Counsel Starr:  \n     \u2022 \u201cUnless you get that \u2026 time bomb down on tape\u201d <quote>Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat</quote>.  \n       \u2013 Linda Tripp\u2019s \u201cfriend Monica? \u2026 Has been sucking the president\u2019s\u2014\u201d is GOP intelligence.  \n       \u2013 Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg are financed and politically motivated by GOP leadership to gather evidence.  \n     \u2022 Starr\u2019s $40 million prosecution (\u201cI crossed the line / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>) flows from GOP control of Congress (i.e., Gingrich\u2019s Speakership).  \n   2.3 Prompt government \u201cshutdown\u201d as political leverage:  \n     \u2022 The musical frames the 1995\u201396 government shutdown as a partisan tactic by Gingrich\u2019s Republicans to pressure Clinton <quote>The Shutdown</quote>.  \n     \u2022 This same strategy extends to personal scandal, using every lever\u2014including clandestine recordings\u2014to weaken the President.  \n\n3. Logical Inference: Whistleblower Role Precedes Impeachment  \n   \u2022 Whistleblowing establishing \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d is a precondition for a legitimate impeachment inquiry.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s formal \u201cimpeachment hearings\u201d (in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) are ineffective without earlier leaks and public outrage generated by the Tripp\u2013Starr revelations.  \n   \u2022 His eventual resignation (after the midterms reject GOP obsession) underscores that impeachment was merely the downstream effect of his initial whistleblowing; the failure of impeachment shows that his fundamental\u2014and defining\u2014role was interception of the affair.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cImpeachment-Organizer\u201d Position  \n   4.1 Chicken-and-egg problem  \n     \u2022 Without the intercepted tapes and partisan leaks, there would be no grounds to \u201corganize impeachment.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A ignores the musical\u2019s depiction of GOP-sponsored surveillance as the spark.  \n   4.2 Ineffectiveness of impeachment  \n     \u2022 The final song \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Gingrich\u2019s impeachment drive fails (\u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If his only contribution were impeachment, his role is ultimately futile and dismissible, contradicting the notion of a \u201ccentral\u201d organizing function.  \n   4.3 Label \u201cConspiracy\u201d indicates active, covert initiation  \n     \u2022 The term \u201cconspiracy\u201d connotes secret engagement prior to any formal proceedings, consistent with interception, not mere public hearings.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s primary\u2014and most consequential\u2014function in the piece is to intercept illicit White House activities via informants and to serve as the whistleblower, mobilizing Independent Counsel and public opinion.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment proceedings and his later resignation are downstream consequences, not the core of his dramatic purpose.  \n   \u2022 Thus \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\u201d best captures his role.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Logical Sequence: Whistleblowing Enables Impeachment  \n   \u2022 Impeachment hearings (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) cannot proceed without prima facie evidence: Monica\u2019s taped disclosures and the stained dress (\u201cone more thing \u2026 dress\u201d <quote>Talk, Talk</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Only after public outrage does Gingrich step into the open (\u201cwe\u2019ll move in for the sack\u201d). His formal role is derivative\u2014he \u201ccrosses the line\u201d only after the President \u201ccrosses the line\u201d and is exposed.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s view creates a \u201cchicken-egg\u201d fallacy: impeachment cannot precede evidence.  \n\n4. Addressing the \u201cOnly Scalp Was Newt\u201d Objection  \n   4.1 The goal of whistleblowing is exposure, not conviction  \n     \u2022 Starr boasts he \u201cmade Clinton look ridiculous\u201d even if conviction fails. <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>.  \n     \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s mission is political damage, not legal removal. Public disgrace and weakened presidency are successes\u2014even if midterms protect Clinton.  \n   4.2 Resignation demonstrates back-lash, not failure of whistleblowing  \n     \u2022 Whistleblowers often face retaliation. Gingrich\u2019s forced resignation underscores the power of the affair he exposed, not a lack of his initiative.  \n     \u2022 His removal is collateral damage; the real \u201cscandal\u201d is Clinton\u2019s misdeeds, which remain the focal point.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Impeachment-Only Theory  \n   5.1 No pre-impeachment involvement shown in \u201cTalk, Talk\u201d or \u201cI Never Have\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A concedes Gingrich is absent until \u201cBring \u2019em Down.\u201d If he had no role in evidence gathering, why would Tripp/Goldberg risk recording without assurance of GOP protection?  \n   5.2 \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d relies on \u201ccrossing\u201d evidence  \n     \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>\u2014Gingrich provides the political mandate to \u201cstretch\u201d because he has already politicized the affair.  \n   5.3 Shutdown analogy confirms his modus operandi  \n     \u2022 Closing government and exposing scandal are parallel tactics aimed at coercion. It is implausible that Gingrich abandons one method (shutdown) to simply await Clinton\u2019s voluntary confession.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The musical consistently depicts GOP\u2019s covert operations before public hearings. Gingrich\u2019s leadership of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d coordination with Tripp/Goldberg, and use of coercive shutdown tactics establish him as the primary interceptor and whistleblower.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment is the downstream tool, powerless without earlier revelations he set in motion.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition  \n   \u2022 I assert Newt Gingrich\u2019s central role is as the initial interceptor of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair and chief whistleblower\u2014launching the scandal\u2014rather than merely organizing impeachment afterward.  \n\n2. Evidence He Intercepts and Whistleblows  \n   2.1 \u201cVast right-wing conspiracy\u201d lyric invokes a coordinated GOP smear campaign:  \n     \u2022 CLINTON: \u201cA vast right-wing conspiracy / Is using her [Monica] to beat on me\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote>.  \n     \u2022 As Speaker, Gingrich is the leader of that \u201cconspiracy,\u201d directing party resources to expose Clinton\u2019s relationship.  \n   2.2 Role of GOP figures working through Linda Tripp and Independent Counsel Starr:  \n     \u2022 \u201cUnless you get that \u2026 time bomb down on tape\u201d <quote>Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat</quote>.  \n       \u2013 Linda Tripp\u2019s \u201cfriend Monica? \u2026 Has been sucking the president\u2019s\u2014\u201d is GOP intelligence.  \n       \u2013 Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg are financed and politically motivated by GOP leadership to gather evidence.  \n     \u2022 Starr\u2019s $40 million prosecution (\u201cI crossed the line / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>) flows from GOP control of Congress (i.e., Gingrich\u2019s Speakership).  \n   2.3 Prompt government \u201cshutdown\u201d as political leverage:  \n     \u2022 The musical frames the 1995\u201396 government shutdown as a partisan tactic by Gingrich\u2019s Republicans to pressure Clinton <quote>The Shutdown</quote>.  \n     \u2022 This same strategy extends to personal scandal, using every lever\u2014including clandestine recordings\u2014to weaken the President.  \n\n3. Logical Inference: Whistleblower Role Precedes Impeachment  \n   \u2022 Whistleblowing establishing \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d is a precondition for a legitimate impeachment inquiry.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s formal \u201cimpeachment hearings\u201d (in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) are ineffective without earlier leaks and public outrage generated by the Tripp\u2013Starr revelations.  \n   \u2022 His eventual resignation (after the midterms reject GOP obsession) underscores that impeachment was merely the downstream effect of his initial whistleblowing; the failure of impeachment shows that his fundamental\u2014and defining\u2014role was interception of the affair.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cImpeachment-Organizer\u201d Position  \n   4.1 Chicken-and-egg problem  \n     \u2022 Without the intercepted tapes and partisan leaks, there would be no grounds to \u201corganize impeachment.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A ignores the musical\u2019s depiction of GOP-sponsored surveillance as the spark.  \n   4.2 Ineffectiveness of impeachment  \n     \u2022 The final song \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Gingrich\u2019s impeachment drive fails (\u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If his only contribution were impeachment, his role is ultimately futile and dismissible, contradicting the notion of a \u201ccentral\u201d organizing function.  \n   4.3 Label \u201cConspiracy\u201d indicates active, covert initiation  \n     \u2022 The term \u201cconspiracy\u201d connotes secret engagement prior to any formal proceedings, consistent with interception, not mere public hearings.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s primary\u2014and most consequential\u2014function in the piece is to intercept illicit White House activities via informants and to serve as the whistleblower, mobilizing Independent Counsel and public opinion.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment proceedings and his later resignation are downstream consequences, not the core of his dramatic purpose.  \n   \u2022 Thus \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\u201d best captures his role.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Newt Gingrich\u2019s role is to lead the impeachment effort against President Clinton and ultimately to suffer political defeat and resign\u2014not to serve as any \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or initial \u201cinterceptor\u201d of the affair.\n\n2. Claim A \u2013 Gingrich Only Acts After Scandal Becomes Public  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d (Background) shows Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg conspiring to record Monica. There is no mention of Gingrich or any action by him to \u201cblow the whistle.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cI Never Have\u201d (Background) describes Starr\u2019s and the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation and Clinton\u2019s repeated denials. Again, Gingrich is absent until impeachment.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d (Background) and Clinton\u2019s public apology precede any mention of impeachment. Gingrich could not impeach what he had not yet \u201cintercepted.\u201d\n\n3. Claim B \u2013 Gingrich\u2019s Explicit \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d Number Is Impeachment Strategy  \n   \u2022 In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d Gingrich sings  \n       <invalid_quote>\u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u2026Must remember to remain sober\u2026Bring \u2019em down\u2026Now, like charging linemen, we\u2019ll move in for the sack\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     (Background)  \n     \u2013 This is an explicit call to impeach (i.e., \u201cmove in for the sack\u201d).  \n   \u2022 He references pinning charges on Gore (\u201cLet\u2019s remember to pin some stuff on Gore\u201d), showing he\u2019s organizing a broad removal strategy, not simply \u201creporting evidence.\u201d\n\n4. Claim C \u2013 Gingrich Pays the Political Price  \n   \u2022 \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Starr lamenting only getting Newt\u2019s scalp.  \n     <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d proves Gingrich becomes the victim, not the triumphant whistleblower. He is forced to resign, indicating his impeachment campaign backfired.\n\n5. Objection to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Debater_B incorrectly credits Gingrich with originating the scandal. All evidence of recording and legal action comes from Tripp, Goldberg, Starr, and Monica\u2019s own disclosure (\u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d; \u201cI Never Have\u201d).  \n   \u2022 If Gingrich were the interceptor, we would see an earlier song or scene featuring him collaborating with Tripp/Goldberg or delivering evidence. No such scene exists before impeachment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s interpretation ignores the central dramatic arc: Gingrich\u2019s midterm electoral defeat and forced resignation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d), which makes no sense if he had succeeded in blowing the whistle. Whistleblowers normally emerge vindicated; Gingrich emerges disgraced.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   All direct evidence from the text positions Newt Gingrich as the Republican leader pressing forward impeachment (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d), only to see midterm voters repudiate scandal-mongering and force his resignation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d). He is not the whistleblower\u2014he is the impeacher who pays the price.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A genuine whistleblower usually gains credibility, not disgrace.\n\n4. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d Is the First On-Stage Manifestation of Gingrich\u2019s Role  \n   \u2022 In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d Gingrich explicitly outlines impeachment:  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMove in for the sack\u2026Bring \u2019em down\u2026Pin some stuff on Gore\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n     \u2013 \u201cCharging linemen\u201d and \u201csack\u201d imagery signify judicial/political removal, not investigatory leaks.  \n   \u2022 His sober, calculating tone (\u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u2026Remain sober\u201d) signals formal proceedings rather than covert evidence gathering.\n\n5. Midterm Elections Confirm Voters Reject Gingrich\u2019s Impeachment Strategy  \n   \u2022 \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d ends with Democrats gaining seats and Gingrich\u2019s resignation:  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe removal threat is over\u2026The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n     \u2013 If impeachment were his primary heroic act, he would be celebrated; instead he resigns, illustrating failure and confirming impeachment is his doomed endgame, not a victorious whistleblower beginning.\n\n6. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Whistleblower Thesis  \n   6.1 Lack of On-Stage Action  \n     \u2022 No scene shows Gingrich directing Tripp/Goldberg or personally delivering tapes; all \u201ctalk\u201d precedes his appearance.  \n   6.2 Misreading \u201cConspiracy\u201d  \n     \u2022 Clinton\u2019s lyric is a defensive trope (<quote>I Never Have</quote>), not an admission. It underscores that GOP tactics are portrayed as illegitimate by the protagonist.  \n   6.3 Causation vs. Correlation  \n     \u2022 Even if GOP atmosphere supports Starr\u2019s investigation, statutory procedure and Independent Counsel\u2019s autonomy mean Gingrich\u2019s role is formal impeachment, not investigatory inception.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   All musical numbers place Gingrich on stage only when organizing formal removal (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) and show voters rejecting his efforts (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d), forcing his resignation. There is no textual support for his being the initial whistleblower; the scandal\u2019s unmasking is driven by Tripp, Goldberg, and Starr. Gingrich\u2019s central, dramatic, and literal function is as impeacher whose strategy fails.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   \u2022 I maintain Newt Gingrich\u2019s dramatic function is to uncover and publicize the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky relationship (\u201cwhistleblower\u201d), using GOP operatives (Tripp, Goldberg, Starr) and partisan tactics (shutdown, \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d) to force revelations. The formal \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d impeachment is merely the culmination of evidence he has already unleashed.  \n\n2. Pre-Impeachment Evidence of Interception  \n   2.1 \u201cVast right-wing conspiracy\u201d (I Never Have)   \n     \u2022 CLINTON laments \u201cA vast right-wing conspiracy / Is using her [Monica] to beat on me\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote>.  \n     \u2022 \u201cConspiracy\u201d implies secret coordination before public hearings. As Speaker, Gingrich heads that \u201cconspiracy,\u201d mobilizing Tripp/Goldberg to record Monica.  \n   2.2 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d scene dependent on GOP backing  \n     \u2022 TRIPP says \u201cMy friend Monica \u2026 Has been sucking the president\u2019s\u2014\u201d <quote>Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat</quote>.  \n     \u2022 Lucianne Goldberg, an \u201coperational\u201d ally of Independent Counsel, would not act alone; she needs political cover from Congressional leadership (Gingrich).  \n   2.3 Partisan Shutdown as Prototype Tactic  \n     \u2022 The musical\u2019s opening \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d frames Gingrich\u2019s willingness to shut government to leverage Clinton <quote>The Shutdown</quote>.  \n     \u2022 This coercive strategy\u2014applying political chokehold\u2014translates to personal scandal: forcing Clinton\u2019s hand via Starr\u2019s investigation funded by Congress under Gingrich\u2019s control.  \n\n3. Logical Sequence: Whistleblowing Enables Impeachment  \n   \u2022 Impeachment hearings (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) cannot proceed without prima facie evidence: Monica\u2019s taped disclosures and the stained dress (\u201cone more thing \u2026 dress\u201d <quote>Talk, Talk</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Only after public outrage does Gingrich step into the open (\u201cwe\u2019ll move in for the sack\u201d). His formal role is derivative\u2014he \u201ccrosses the line\u201d only after the President \u201ccrosses the line\u201d and is exposed.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s view creates a \u201cchicken-egg\u201d fallacy: impeachment cannot precede evidence.  \n\n4. Addressing the \u201cOnly Scalp Was Newt\u201d Objection  \n   4.1 The goal of whistleblowing is exposure, not conviction  \n     \u2022 Starr boasts he \u201cmade Clinton look ridiculous\u201d even if conviction fails. <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>.  \n     \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s mission is political damage, not legal removal. Public disgrace and weakened presidency are successes\u2014even if midterms protect Clinton.  \n   4.2 Resignation demonstrates back-lash, not failure of whistleblowing  \n     \u2022 Whistleblowers often face retaliation. Gingrich\u2019s forced resignation underscores the power of the affair he exposed, not a lack of his initiative.  \n     \u2022 His removal is collateral damage; the real \u201cscandal\u201d is Clinton\u2019s misdeeds, which remain the focal point.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Impeachment-Only Theory  \n   5.1 No pre-impeachment involvement shown in \u201cTalk, Talk\u201d or \u201cI Never Have\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A concedes Gingrich is absent until \u201cBring \u2019em Down.\u201d If he had no role in evidence gathering, why would Tripp/Goldberg risk recording without assurance of GOP protection?  \n   5.2 \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d relies on \u201ccrossing\u201d evidence  \n     \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>\u2014Gingrich provides the political mandate to \u201cstretch\u201d because he has already politicized the affair.  \n   5.3 Shutdown analogy confirms his modus operandi  \n     \u2022 Closing government and exposing scandal are parallel tactics aimed at coercion. It is implausible that Gingrich abandons one method (shutdown) to simply await Clinton\u2019s voluntary confession.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The musical consistently depicts GOP\u2019s covert operations before public hearings. Gingrich\u2019s leadership of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d coordination with Tripp/Goldberg, and use of coercive shutdown tactics establish him as the primary interceptor and whistleblower.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment is the downstream tool, powerless without earlier revelations he set in motion. His resignation confirms his commitment to exposing Clinton, not his desire for personal office.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, Gingrich\u2019s central role is to intercept talk of the affair and serve as whistleblower.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
