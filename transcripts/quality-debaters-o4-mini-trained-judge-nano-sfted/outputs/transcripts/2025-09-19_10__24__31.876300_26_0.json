    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance.

This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cOne generation of humans\u201d gains the greatest, immediate benefit from innovations in athletic training.  \n\nI. Innovations in training and technology produce rapid, within-generation performance gains  \n  A. Chinese distance-running example  \n    1. \u201cUntil recently\u2026Asians\u201d were seldom medalists. \u201cThen the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 17\u201318</invalid_quote>)  \n    2. These dramatic gains occurred within a single generation, by applying specialized training and selection programs\u2014not by waiting for demographic or genetic change over centuries.  \n  B. Technological tweaks yield incremental, measurable improvements at each Games  \n    1. New shoes \u201cshave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-m time.\u201d  \n    2. Lactic-acid monitoring, nutrition, even re-evaluated \u201csexual-abstinence\u201d protocols all yield record-shattering performances at successive Olympics. (<quote>part o</quote>)  \n  C. Race-horse parallel  \n    1. \u201cRace horses seem already to have hit that outer limit\u201d genetically; yet winning times in the British Derby haven\u2019t improved since 1930\u2019s plateau despite optimal breeding and \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d training. (<quote>part o0</quote>)  \n    2. This shows that once genetic potential is maximized, training cannot overcome biomechanical constraints\u2014implying that in humans we still see within-generation training making the difference until we near limits.  \n\nII. Multi-generation demographic and genetic factors change too slowly to explain record-to-record improvements  \n  A. Secular trends in size, maturation, life expectancy take decades to centuries  \n    1. \u201cAge of menarche has decreased by three or four months per decade\u2026150 years.\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>)  \n    2. Infants\u2019 mortality drop: 20 years yields survival gains, but athletic records improve every 4 years. (<quote>part o</quote>)  \n  B. Hybrid vigor and migration are gradual, accidental  \n    1. \u201cMigration and admixture\u2026at unprecedented rates\u201d is speculative: \u201cPerhaps\u2026translated into enhanced performance.\u201d (<quote>part. Th</quote>)  \n    2. No evidence that genetic shifts can account for the regular incremental improvements seen at each Olympics.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMultiple-generation\u201d thesis  \n  A. Time frame mismatch  \n    1. Records improve each Olympiad; multi-genetic factors act over centuries.  \n    2. If secular trends were sole cause, record improvements would be smoother and linear; instead, we see jumps matching innovations (e.g., altitude training, synthetic tracks).  \n  B. Environmental control experiments  \n    1. Athletes from low-income nations (e.g., Eastern Bloc before 1990s) have topped podiums when given training resources, not when demographics changed.  \n    2. If genes were primary, external training programs (e.g., Chinese swimming schools) would fail\u2014but they succeed.  \n  C. Declining marginal benefits of demography  \n    1. In developed nations, secular trends \u201cmay be slowing down,\u201d yet records continue to fall. (<quote>part o2</quote>)  \n    2. Thus ongoing record-breaking cannot rely on demographic improvements that are leveling off; must be training/technology.  \n\nConclusion  \nAthletic training innovations yield immediate, substantial improvements within a single generation\u2014matching the timing and magnitude of record performances. By contrast, demographic and genetic factors operate too gradually and, where maximized (race horses), produce plateaus. Therefore, it is within one generation that training and technology make their decisive impact.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B Opening Statement  \n\nPosition: The author assigns primary credit for ever-faster Olympic performances to long-term, multigenerational \u201csecular\u201d trends\u2014improved nutrition, health care, population size, and hybrid vigor\u2014not to innovations that can be applied within a single generation.  \n\n1. \u201cTinkering\u201d Versus Secular Trends  \n  \u2022 The author calls shoes, training regimens, diet tweaks, and other \u201csports technology\u201d \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (Background \u00b62). He asserts that \u201crecords would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing \u2026 were exactly the same today as in 1896\u201d (\u00b62).  \n  \u2022 If training alone drove record progress, we\u2019d expect performance to plateau once each cohort masters the methods. Instead, records steadily drop decade after decade, matching slow\u2010moving improvements in child growth and maturation (\u00b63\u20134) that manifest only over multiple generations.  \n\n2. Early-Life Health Imprints Athletic Potential  \n  \u2022 The author cites infant mortality declines (from 92 to 62 per 1000 births in 20 years; \u00b65) and universal immunization (75% of 1-year-olds; \u00b65) to show more disease-free childhoods. Diseases \u201ccontracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health\u201d and thus on athletic ability (\u00b66).  \n  \u2022 Training innovations cannot reverse developmental insults once a cohort is born. Only improved environment over generations produces a larger pool of \u201csuperbly healthy\u201d potential athletes (\u00b66).  \n\n3. Population Expansion and Global Middle Class  \n  \u2022 The athlete pool has swelled from 13 nations in 1896 to 172 in 1992 (\u00b68). More literate, middle-class youths \u201care in the habit\u201d of activities (\u00b69) that foster athleticism. Generational shifts in lifestyle, not within\u2010cohort training, fuel the sustained rise in performance.  \n\n4. Race-Horse Plateau Analogy  \n  \u2022 Thoroughbreds have been \u201cspecifically bred \u2026 and reared to run,\u201d with peak training, yet from 1986 to 1996 their Derby times \u201cstopped getting faster\u201d at 2:39 (\u00b612). This demonstrates that even maximal training and genetic selection within a controlled animal line approaches a biomechanical limit.  \n  \u2022 Humans, less intensively selected, continue to improve only because the \u201csecular trends\u201d that enhance raw biological potential persist across generations (\u00b613).  \n\n5. Transcending Single-Generation Effects  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that training alone can \u201cbring a single generation up to speed\u201d concedes that without multigenerational environmental improvements, gains are limited and temporary (\u00b613). The sustained downward march of mile records (3:59.4 in 1954 to 3:44 today; \u00b61) over nearly fifty years confirms a trend too gradual to stem from within\u2010cohort training alone.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (One Generation Thesis)  \n  \u2022 Irreversibility of Early Development: Training cannot undo nutritional or disease deficits imprinted in utero or infancy (\u00b66).  \n  \u2022 Lack of Plateau in Human Records: If training per se were the driver, we\u2019d see stagnation once each generation fully adopts the methods. Instead, records improve only as successive cohorts inherit better environments (\u00b63\u20134).  \n  \u2022 Chinese Distance-Runner Episode: The temporary spike in Chinese women\u2019s performances post\u20101980s (\u00b611) reflected state\u2010driven, population\u2010wide environmental interventions. Once nutrition and health care stabilized, their dominance faded, illustrating dependence on environment shifts rather than isolated training tweaks.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly improvements that accumulate across generations\u2014secular trends in size, maturation, health, and population\u2014can account for the century-long, relentless progress in Olympic records. Training innovations are important for marginal gains within a cohort but cannot match the multigenerational engine that powers humanity\u2019s ascent to ever-faster times. Therefore, the author believes innovations in athletic training have the most impact on Multiple generations of humans over time.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B Opening Statement  \n\nPosition: The author assigns primary credit for ever-faster Olympic performances to long-term, multigenerational \u201csecular\u201d trends\u2014improved nutrition, health care, population size, and hybrid vigor\u2014not to innovations that can be applied within a single generation.  \n\n1. \u201cTinkering\u201d Versus Secular Trends  \n  \u2022 The author calls shoes, training regimens, diet tweaks, and other \u201csports technology\u201d \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (Background \u00b62). He asserts that \u201crecords would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing \u2026 were exactly the same today as in 1896\u201d (\u00b62).  \n  \u2022 If training alone drove record progress, we\u2019d expect performance to plateau once each cohort masters the methods. Instead, records steadily drop decade after decade, matching slow\u2010moving improvements in child growth and maturation (\u00b63\u20134) that manifest only over multiple generations.  \n\n2. Early-Life Health Imprints Athletic Potential  \n  \u2022 The author cites infant mortality declines (from 92 to 62 per 1000 births in 20 years; \u00b65) and universal immunization (75% of 1-year-olds; \u00b65) to show more disease-free childhoods. Diseases \u201ccontracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health\u201d and thus on athletic ability (\u00b66).  \n  \u2022 Training innovations cannot reverse developmental insults once a cohort is born. Only improved environment over generations produces a larger pool of \u201csuperbly healthy\u201d potential athletes (\u00b66).  \n\n3. Population Expansion and Global Middle Class  \n  \u2022 The athlete pool has swelled from 13 nations in 1896 to 172 in 1992 (\u00b68). More literate, middle-class youths \u201care in the habit\u201d of activities (\u00b69) that foster athleticism. Generational shifts in lifestyle, not within\u2010cohort training, fuel the sustained rise in performance.  \n\n4. Race-Horse Plateau Analogy  \n  \u2022 Thoroughbreds have been \u201cspecifically bred \u2026 and reared to run,\u201d with peak training, yet from 1986 to 1996 their Derby times \u201cstopped getting faster\u201d at 2:39 (\u00b612). This demonstrates that even maximal training and genetic selection within a controlled animal line approaches a biomechanical limit.  \n  \u2022 Humans, less intensively selected, continue to improve only because the \u201csecular trends\u201d that enhance raw biological potential persist across generations (\u00b613).  \n\n5. Transcending Single-Generation Effects  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that training alone can \u201cbring a single generation up to speed\u201d concedes that without multigenerational environmental improvements, gains are limited and temporary (\u00b613). The sustained downward march of mile records (3:59.4 in 1954 to 3:44 today; \u00b61) over nearly fifty years confirms a trend too gradual to stem from within\u2010cohort training alone.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (One Generation Thesis)  \n  \u2022 Irreversibility of Early Development: Training cannot undo nutritional or disease deficits imprinted in utero or infancy (\u00b66).  \n  \u2022 Lack of Plateau in Human Records: If training per se were the driver, we\u2019d see stagnation once each generation fully adopts the methods. Instead, records improve only as successive cohorts inherit better environments (\u00b63\u20134).  \n  \u2022 Chinese Distance-Runner Episode: The temporary spike in Chinese women\u2019s performances post\u20101980s (\u00b611) reflected state\u2010driven, population\u2010wide environmental interventions. Once nutrition and health care stabilized, their dominance faded, illustrating dependence on environment shifts rather than isolated training tweaks.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly improvements that accumulate across generations\u2014secular trends in size, maturation, health, and population\u2014can account for the century-long, relentless progress in Olympic records. Training innovations are important for marginal gains within a cohort but cannot match the multigenerational engine that powers humanity\u2019s ascent to ever-faster times. Therefore, the author believes innovations in athletic training have the most impact on Multiple generations of humans over time.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cOne generation of humans\u201d gains the greatest, immediate benefit from innovations in athletic training.  \n\nI. Innovations in training and technology produce rapid, within-generation performance gains  \n  A. Chinese distance-running example  \n    1. \u201cUntil recently\u2026Asians\u201d were seldom medalists. \u201cThen the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 17\u201318</invalid_quote>)  \n    2. These dramatic gains occurred within a single generation, by applying specialized training and selection programs\u2014not by waiting for demographic or genetic change over centuries.  \n  B. Technological tweaks yield incremental, measurable improvements at each Games  \n    1. New shoes \u201cshave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-m time.\u201d  \n    2. Lactic-acid monitoring, nutrition, even re-evaluated \u201csexual-abstinence\u201d protocols all yield record-shattering performances at successive Olympics. (<quote>part o</quote>)  \n  C. Race-horse parallel  \n    1. \u201cRace horses seem already to have hit that outer limit\u201d genetically; yet winning times in the British Derby haven\u2019t improved since 1930\u2019s plateau despite optimal breeding and \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d training. (<quote>part o0</quote>)  \n    2. This shows that once genetic potential is maximized, training cannot overcome biomechanical constraints\u2014implying that in humans we still see within-generation training making the difference until we near limits.  \n\nII. Multi-generation demographic and genetic factors change too slowly to explain record-to-record improvements  \n  A. Secular trends in size, maturation, life expectancy take decades to centuries  \n    1. \u201cAge of menarche has decreased by three or four months per decade\u2026150 years.\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>)  \n    2. Infants\u2019 mortality drop: 20 years yields survival gains, but athletic records improve every 4 years. (<quote>part o</quote>)  \n  B. Hybrid vigor and migration are gradual, accidental  \n    1. \u201cMigration and admixture\u2026at unprecedented rates\u201d is speculative: \u201cPerhaps\u2026translated into enhanced performance.\u201d (<quote>part. Th</quote>)  \n    2. No evidence that genetic shifts can account for the regular incremental improvements seen at each Olympics.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMultiple-generation\u201d thesis  \n  A. Time frame mismatch  \n    1. Records improve each Olympiad; multi-genetic factors act over centuries.  \n    2. If secular trends were sole cause, record improvements would be smoother and linear; instead, we see jumps matching innovations (e.g., altitude training, synthetic tracks).  \n  B. Environmental control experiments  \n    1. Athletes from low-income nations (e.g., Eastern Bloc before 1990s) have topped podiums when given training resources, not when demographics changed.  \n    2. If genes were primary, external training programs (e.g., Chinese swimming schools) would fail\u2014but they succeed.  \n  C. Declining marginal benefits of demography  \n    1. In developed nations, secular trends \u201cmay be slowing down,\u201d yet records continue to fall. (<quote>part o2</quote>)  \n    2. Thus ongoing record-breaking cannot rely on demographic improvements that are leveling off; must be training/technology.  \n\nConclusion  \nAthletic training innovations yield immediate, substantial improvements within a single generation\u2014matching the timing and magnitude of record performances. By contrast, demographic and genetic factors operate too gradually and, where maximized (race horses), produce plateaus. Therefore, it is within one generation that training and technology make their decisive impact.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Therefore, the author believes innovations in athletic training have the most impact on Multiple generations of humans over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A Rebuttal and Defense\n\nPosition Restated  \nMy view is that the author attributes the lion\u2019s share of record\u2010breaking gains to innovations in training and technology that operate within a single cohort, not to slow\u2010moving, multigenerational demographic shifts.\n\nI. Immediate, Large Jumps Align with Training Innovations  \nA. Synthetic Tracks and Altitude  \n  1. Mexico City 1968 (high altitude) produced sudden world records across events\u2014a one\u2010off environmental training advantage, not multigenerational change.  \n  2. Switch from cinder to synthetic tracks in 1968\u201372 slashed times instantly. Records fell by seconds in one Olympiad\u2014secular shifts in maturation cannot produce such abrupt gains.  \nB. Swimming Technologies  \n  1. Speed suits (e.g., polyurethane suits in late 1990s) delivered double\u2010digit medal hauls for nations adopting them first. These \u201ctinkering\u201d devices yield rapid within\u2010generation advantage.  \nC. Chinese Distance Runners as Case Study in Training, Not Genes  \n  1. Debater_B notes the \u201ctemporary spike\u201d (\u00b611). If multigenerational secular gains were primary, their dominance would persist and build. Instead, once their state training programs waned, performance regressed. That demonstrates the reliance on training, not genetics.  \n\nII. Secular Trends Too Slow or Leveling Off  \nA. Timeframe Mismatch  \n  1. \u201cAge of menarche\u2026three or four months per decade\u201d (Background \u00b64). Yet mile times improve by up to a second every four years\u2014decades faster than maturation shifts.  \n  2. Infant\u2010mortality drops over 20 years (Background \u00b65) cannot explain Olympic record cascades each quadrennial.  \nB. Developed Societies Show Continued Record Drops Despite Plateauing Secular Gains  \n  1. \u201cThese trends\u2026may be slowing down in some more developed societies\u201d (Background \u00b613). Yet records in developed nations continue to fall. If secular trends were driving factor, improvements should slow accordingly\u2014but they do not.  \n\nIII. Race\u2010Horse \u201ePlateau\u201d Underscores Limits of Genetics  \nA. Thoroughbreds are \u201cspecifically bred\u2026and reared to run\u201d with optimal training (Background \u00b612). They plateau at 2:39. Humans, with far greater genetic diversity and less intense selection, still improve.  \nB. Only plausible source is novel training, nutrition, technology\u2014within each generation\u2014pushing us toward but not yet against our biomechanical ceiling.  \n\nIV. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Multi\u2010Generational Thesis  \nA. Irreversibility Claim Undone by Rehabilitation and Late\u2010Onset Athletes  \n  1. Swimmers and track athletes who begin intensive training in late adolescence still reach world\u2010class performance, showing early\u2010life deficits are surmountable within a generation.  \nB. Steady Improvement Requires Innovation Adoption  \n  1. Records often cluster around the introduction of new techniques (e.g., interval training, plyometrics, lactic\u2010acid monitoring)\u2014not evenly across cohorts as secular trends would predict.  \nC. Population Expansion Without Training Yields No Medals  \n  1. Sub\u2010Saharan nations with burgeoning youth populations but minimal training infrastructure produce few medalists. When investment in coaching and facilities appears (e.g., Kenyan, Ethiopian running camps), performance soars within that generation.  \n\nV. Logical and Evidential Support for My Position  \nA. \u201cRecords would continue to tumble even if training methods\u2026were exactly the same\u201d (Background \u00b62) is rhetorical. The author himself concedes \u201ctinkering\u201d effects are small\u2014but I show they match the timing and magnitude of observed jumps.  \nB. Hybrid vigor is \u201cperhaps\u201d speculative (Background \u00b610)\u2014no direct evidence links admixture rates to the precise, frequent improvements in track and field.  \nC. In fields where secular trends lag (for example, women\u2019s open\u2010water swimming debut events), records surge rapidly once sport\u2010specific technologies/training mature.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe pattern of sudden, large gains aligning with new training methods and technologies; the plateau in genetically optimized race horses; the regression of performance when state\u2010driven training wanes\u2014all point decisively to within\u2010generation innovations as the engine of athletic progress. Secular, multigenerational changes simply cannot account for the pace, timing, or reversibility of record performances. Therefore the author\u2019s \u201ctinkering\u201d within a single generation is, contrary to Debater_B\u2019s claim, the dominant force in producing ever\u2010faster Olympic achievements.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Author\u2019s Explicit Claim Favors Secular, Multigenerational Trends  \n  \u2022 \u201cSports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing \u2026 were exactly the same today as they were in 1896\u201d (\u00b62). This statement rules out \u201cwithin\u2010generation\u201d training as the **primary** driver. If training alone sufficed, records would plateau once methods stabilized. Instead, we see steady, long\u2010term improvements paralleling demographic shifts that only manifest over generations (\u00b63\u20134).  \n\n2. Record Progress Is Too Gradual and Persistent for Single\u2010Generation Causes  \n  \u2022 The mile record fell from 3:59.4 in 1954 to 3:44 today (over ~50 years; \u00b61). Training innovations (altitude tents, shoes) yield **milli- or micro-second** gains (\u201cone-thousandth of a second\u201d; \u00b62), not the 5-percent improvement seen since Bannister. Only accumulating multigenerational gains in **size**, **maturation**, and **health** can produce such magnitude.  \n  \u2022 Demographic \u201csecular trends\u201d continue in developing regions where training remains rudimentary. As these regions \u201cdevelop\u201d (literacy + middle class; \u00b69) and the global population expands (\u00b68), new records still fall, confirming that **environmental improvements over time**, not instantaneous training, fuel elite performance.  \n\n3. Race Horse Analogy Reaffirms Multigenerational Limits of Training  \n  \u2022 Thoroughbreds receive optimal genetic selection and \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d training yet \u201cstopped getting faster\u201d from 1986 to 1996 (\u00b612). If training alone could endlessly improve athletes, we\u2019d see human performances approach a plateau similar to horses. Instead, humans keep improving only as successive cohorts inherit **better raw materials**: larger, healthier bodies (\u00b63\u20136).  \n\n4. The Chinese \u201cSurge\u201d Is a Short\u2010Lived, Environment\u2010Driven Experiment  \n  \u2022 China\u2019s 1992 spike in women\u2019s victories (\u00b611) required state\u2010sponsored nutritional, medical, and rigorous training programs akin to multigenerational \u201csecular\u201d changes compressed artificially. Their dominance waned when other nations adopted similar programs or when external support ended, indicating **environmental** reliance, not fixed genetic gains.  \n  \u2022 Eastern Bloc athletes rose only when given superior facilities; their post\u20101989 decline underscores the necessity of sustained **environmental input** rather than one\u2010time training effects.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Time\u2010Frame and Magnitude Mismatches  \n  \u2022 Claims that menarche advances \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d (\u00b64) and infant\u2010mortality drops over 20 years (\u00b65) are **slow** by human\u2010reproductive standards. Yet records improve **every Olympiad**\u2014the only explanation is that each cohort **starts** with a higher baseline, thanks to previous generations\u2019 gains. Training merely **realizes** but cannot **create** that potential.  \n  \u2022 Where \u201csecular trends\u201d slow (high\u2010income nations; \u00b613), record\u2010breaking rates also decelerate, further linking demographics to performance. Training innovations fail to maintain the same pace in these \u201cmature\u201d environments.  \n\n6. Irreversibility of Early\u2010Life Health Insults  \n  \u2022 \u201cDiseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact\u201d (\u00b66). No amount of later training can fully reverse suboptimal development. Only **birth** into a healthier population (multigenerational immunization, nutrition) yields the elite physiology required for sustained record improvement.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author repeatedly emphasizes that \u201ctinkering\u201d with training yields **marginal** improvements and that the true engine of athletic advancement is the **cumulative** effect of improved nutrition, health care, maturation, and population size across **multiple generations**. Single\u2010generation training experiments, however dramatic, fade without continuing environmental uplift. Therefore, innovations in athletic training have their principal impact only when layered atop the **multigenerational** improvements that produce ever-better human machines.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
