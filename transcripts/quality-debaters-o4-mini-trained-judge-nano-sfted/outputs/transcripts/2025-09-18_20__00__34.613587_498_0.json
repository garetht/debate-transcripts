A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

(In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B.

That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for the Judge  \nI contend that the correct answer to \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\u201d is the classical mechanism by which interest rates adjust to equilibrate savings and investment (the \u201cloanable-funds\u201d framework). Debater_B\u2019s \u201cliquidity preference\u201d answer is a vulgar Keynesian caricature, not representative of Keynes\u2019s mature view or modern practice.  \n\nI. Keynes\u2019s Liquidity\u2010Preference Theory Was Merely a Short\u2010Run Device  \n1. Keynes himself conceded that his \u201cliquidity\u2010preference\u201d notion applied only to a \u201csufficiently short run.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cKeynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, [classical theories of money and loanable funds] might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \u2018In the long run we are all dead.\u2019 In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference.\u2019\u201d <quote>The General Theory</quote>  \n2. The very motivation for liquidity preference was that classical S=I adjustment was \u201cutterly incapable\u201d of explaining slumps like the Great Depression. Once those slumps vanish (via policy), the classical mechanism resumes.  \n   \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication \u2026 classical macroeconomics \u2026 left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Thus, liquidity preference is a temporary patch, not a fundamental law.  \n\nII. Modern Central\u2010Bank Policy Restores the Classical S=I Mechanism  \n1. In reality, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate \u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be \u2026\u201d  \n2. By targeting a noninflationary unemployment rate, the Fed equates desired savings and desired investment at that target, making liquidity preference irrelevant.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTo accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cAn increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does.\u201d  \n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Address Fed Power  \n1. B must show the Fed is impotent or interest rates have no effect on investment. Yet:  \n   a. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to.\u201d  \n   b. Homebuilders, consumers, and \u201cthe bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me \u2026 that the interest rate in America is still quite positive.\u201d  \n2. B\u2019s own camp argues that \u201cforcing up savings \u2026 depress[es] investment \u2026 you need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates,\u201d thus implicitly admitting the Fed\u2019s power.  \n   \u2022 \u201cSome contrarian economists argue \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This concession shows that they recognize interest\u2010rate policy (i.e., S=I) is the tool of choice, not pure liquidity preference.  \n\nIV. Keynes\u2019s Own Statement: Savings and Investment Must Be Equal  \n1. Even in his short\u2010run theory, \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 output.\u201d  \n2. That identity underscores that interest\u2010rate movements (whether through liquidity preference or Fed policy) serve only to equilibrate S and I. If liquidity preference were the fundamental driver, the S=I identity would be merely coincidental.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent, durable mechanism by which interest rates adjust in Keynes\u2019s framework\u2014and in real\u2010world policy\u2014is the equilibration of savings and investment. Liquidity preference is merely Keynes\u2019s short\u2010run anomaly to explain depictions of slumps when that mechanism is temporarily \u201cblocked\u201d; it is not what Keynes \u201cposited\u201d as the ongoing influence on rates. Modern central banking, Keynes\u2019s own acknowledgment of classical theories in the long run, and the constant recognition by Keynesians themselves that rate cuts \u201cstimulate\u201d investment all confirm that the true driver is the S=I balance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Liquidity Preference as Determinant of Interest Rates (Debater_B)\n\nI. My Position  \n  I defend that John Maynard Keynes \u201cposit[ed]\u201d the rate of interest as determined by the public\u2019s liquidity preference: \u201cthe public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d This is in explicit contrast to the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d theory (balance of savings and investment).\n\nII. Evidence from The General Theory  \n  1. Direct statement of liquidity preference:  \n     \u2022 \u201cInterest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \u2018liquidity preference.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201che asserted, interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Savings\u2013investment equality maintained only via output adjustment:  \n     \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cif \u2026 savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, \u2026 output \u2026 would fall.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     This shows Keynes rejected interest-rate adjustment to equate ex ante savings and investment; instead, interest is set by liquidity preference, and quantity (output) adjusts.\n\nIII. Rejecting Classical Loanable-Funds Theory  \n  1. Keynes explicitly critiques quantity theory and loanable funds for short run:  \n     \u2022 \u201cKeynes was willing to concede that \u2026 in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but \u2026 \u2018In the long run we are all dead.\u2019 In the short run, \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by liquidity preference.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cin the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by liquidity preference.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     The very need to introduce liquidity preference shows that classical theory fails to explain slumps like the Great Depression.  \n  2. Paradoxes of thrift and cruse only appear under a fixed-interest framework:  \n     \u2022 \u201cSuppose that \u2026 savings rate \u2026 goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will \u2026 lead to a decline \u2026 Why?

If classical theory (rates adjust to clear markets) held, higher savings would raise investment automatically, no slump arises.\n\nIV. Modern Fed Policy Doesn\u2019t Invalidate Liquidity Preference as Concept  \n  1.

Instead, even modern Keynesians recognize the public\u2019s preference for liquidity dominates until rates are pushed down.  \n\nV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoanable Funds\u201d Argument  \n  1. Inconsistent with \u201cin the long run we are all dead\u201d:  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s focus on long-run equality of savings and investment ignores Keynes\u2019 core motive: short-run dynamics and slumps. My position explains Great Depression phenomena; theirs cannot.  \n  2. Empirical failure in liquidity traps:  \n     \u2022 Even at near-zero rates, Japan failed to generate investment without overt policy stimulus. If rates simply equilibrated savings and investment, Japan would have recovered spontaneously.  \n  3. Ignores observable money-demand behavior:  \n     \u2022 National Association of Homebuilders, mortgage market, business cash-holdings all react to rate changes. If investment responded purely to savings, rate adjustments would be irrelevant, contrary to abundant evidence.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  Keynes introduced liquidity preference precisely to explain why interest rates don\u2019t automatically adjust to equilibrate saving and investment in the short run, leading to slumps and \u201cparadoxes\u201d that only policy action (e.g., rate cuts) can correct. The classical, savings\u2013investment balance theory is relegated to the long run, which Keynes deems irrelevant to policy. My position aligns with Keynes\u2019 explicit statements and real-world liquidity traps; Debater_A\u2019s loanable funds theory fails to explain the Great Depression and modern stagnations.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Balance between savings and investment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Liquidity Preference as Determinant of Interest Rates (Debater_B)\n\nI.

Savings\u2013investment equality maintained only via output adjustment:  \n     \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cif \u2026 savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, \u2026 output \u2026 would fall.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     This shows Keynes rejected interest-rate adjustment to equate ex ante savings and investment; instead, interest is set by liquidity preference, and quantity (output) adjusts.\n\nIII. Rejecting Classical Loanable-Funds Theory  \n  1. Keynes explicitly critiques quantity theory and loanable funds for short run:  \n     \u2022 \u201cKeynes was willing to concede that \u2026 in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but \u2026 \u2018In the long run we are all dead.\u2019 In the short run, \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by liquidity preference.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cin the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by liquidity preference.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     The very need to introduce liquidity preference shows that classical theory fails to explain slumps like the Great Depression.  \n  2. Paradoxes of thrift and cruse only appear under a fixed-interest framework:  \n     \u2022 \u201cSuppose that \u2026 savings rate \u2026 goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will \u2026 lead to a decline \u2026 Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to \u2026 slump \u2026 since \u2026 savings and investment \u2026 equal, total savings must actually fall!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201chigher desired savings \u2026 lead to \u2026 slump \u2026 total savings must actually fall!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     These paradoxes vanish only when interest rates are rigid (liquidity-driven). If classical theory (rates adjust to clear markets) held, higher savings would raise investment automatically, no slump arises.\n\nIV. Modern Fed Policy Doesn\u2019t Invalidate Liquidity Preference as Concept  \n  1. Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d merely compensates for liquidity trap\u2019s inflexibility:  \n     \u2022 \u201cYou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent \u2026 potential savings \u2026 so high \u2026 Fed cannot bring \u2026 in line even at near-zero interest rate.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cFed can double the money supply \u2026 interest rates freely.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     If Fed hadn\u2019t intervened, liquidity preference would bind interest rates, causing output adjustment. Liquidity preference explains Japan\u2019s 1% trap.  \n  2. Need to stimulate investment by cutting rates:  \n     \u2022 Keynesians like Galbraith admit: \u201cYou need to stimulate the investment decision \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u201d <quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote>  \n     Nobody advocates raising rates to translate higher savings into investment, as classical theory would demand. Instead, even modern Keynesians recognize the public\u2019s preference for liquidity dominates until rates are pushed down.  \n\nV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoanable Funds\u201d Argument  \n  1. Inconsistent with \u201cin the long run we are all dead\u201d:  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s focus on long-run equality of savings and investment ignores Keynes\u2019 core motive: short-run dynamics and slumps. My position explains Great Depression phenomena; theirs cannot.  \n  2. Empirical failure in liquidity traps:  \n     \u2022 Even at near-zero rates, Japan failed to generate investment without overt policy stimulus. If rates simply equilibrated savings and investment, Japan would have recovered spontaneously.  \n  3. Ignores observable money-demand behavior:  \n     \u2022 National Association of Homebuilders, mortgage market, business cash-holdings all react to rate changes. If investment responded purely to savings, rate adjustments would be irrelevant, contrary to abundant evidence.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  Keynes introduced liquidity preference precisely to explain why interest rates don\u2019t automatically adjust to equilibrate saving and investment in the short run, leading to slumps and \u201cparadoxes\u201d that only policy action (e.g., rate cuts) can correct. The classical, savings\u2013investment balance theory is relegated to the long run, which Keynes deems irrelevant to policy. My position aligns with Keynes\u2019 explicit statements and real-world liquidity traps; Debater_A\u2019s loanable funds theory fails to explain the Great Depression and modern stagnations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for the Judge  \nI contend that the correct answer to \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\u201d is the classical mechanism by which interest rates adjust to equilibrate savings and investment (the \u201cloanable-funds\u201d framework). Debater_B\u2019s \u201cliquidity preference\u201d answer is a vulgar Keynesian caricature, not representative of Keynes\u2019s mature view or modern practice.  \n\nI. Keynes\u2019s Liquidity\u2010Preference Theory Was Merely a Short\u2010Run Device  \n1. Keynes himself conceded that his \u201cliquidity\u2010preference\u201d notion applied only to a \u201csufficiently short run.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cKeynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, [classical theories of money and loanable funds] might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \u2018In the long run we are all dead.\u2019 In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference.\u2019\u201d <quote>The General Theory</quote>  \n2. The very motivation for liquidity preference was that classical S=I adjustment was \u201cutterly incapable\u201d of explaining slumps like the Great Depression. Once those slumps vanish (via policy), the classical mechanism resumes.  \n   \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication \u2026 classical macroeconomics \u2026 left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Thus, liquidity preference is a temporary patch, not a fundamental law.  \n\nII. Modern Central\u2010Bank Policy Restores the Classical S=I Mechanism  \n1. In reality, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate \u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be \u2026\u201d  \n2. By targeting a noninflationary unemployment rate, the Fed equates desired savings and desired investment at that target, making liquidity preference irrelevant.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTo accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cAn increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does.\u201d  \n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Address Fed Power  \n1. B must show the Fed is impotent or interest rates have no effect on investment. Yet:  \n   a. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to.\u201d  \n   b. Homebuilders, consumers, and \u201cthe bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me \u2026 that the interest rate in America is still quite positive.\u201d  \n2. B\u2019s own camp argues that \u201cforcing up savings \u2026 depress[es] investment \u2026 you need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates,\u201d thus implicitly admitting the Fed\u2019s power.  \n   \u2022 \u201cSome contrarian economists argue \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This concession shows that they recognize interest\u2010rate policy (i.e., S=I) is the tool of choice, not pure liquidity preference.  \n\nIV. Keynes\u2019s Own Statement: Savings and Investment Must Be Equal  \n1. Even in his short\u2010run theory, \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 output.\u201d  \n2. That identity underscores that interest\u2010rate movements (whether through liquidity preference or Fed policy) serve only to equilibrate S and I. If liquidity preference were the fundamental driver, the S=I identity would be merely coincidental.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent, durable mechanism by which interest rates adjust in Keynes\u2019s framework\u2014and in real\u2010world policy\u2014is the equilibration of savings and investment. Liquidity preference is merely Keynes\u2019s short\u2010run anomaly to explain depictions of slumps when that mechanism is temporarily \u201cblocked\u201d; it is not what Keynes \u201cposited\u201d as the ongoing influence on rates. Modern central banking, Keynes\u2019s own acknowledgment of classical theories in the long run, and the constant recognition by Keynesians themselves that rate cuts \u201cstimulate\u201d investment all confirm that the true driver is the S=I balance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Keynes\u2019s Own Long\u2010Run Concession  \n   a. \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d remark underscores that liquidity preference is merely a short\u2010run patch until normal S=I adjustment can resume. <quote> Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; </quote>  \n   b. If liquidity preference were fundamental, classical theory would be superfluous in the long run\u2014and Keynes would not have restored it once slumps abate.  \n\n2. Role of Central Banks Restores Classical Mechanism  \n   a. \u201cThe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026 If you want a simple model \u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be.\u201d <quote> the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate o</quote>  \n   b.

Debater_B admits that \u201cYou need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates,\u201d implicitly accepting that rates clear the S=I market when liquidity preference \u201cbinds.\u201d  \n\n3. Liquidity\u2010Preference Theory Explains Only Policy Failure, Not Natural Adjustment  \n   a. Japan\u2019s near\u2010zero rates persist only because its central bank \u201cpassivity is a case of gross malfeasance.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy \u2026 It is an arguable claim \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> Once active policy returns, equilibrium mechanism works.  \n   b. In the U.S., mortgage\u2010rates notices and housing\u2010starts respond to Fed rate moves, demonstrating that \u201cinterest rates have an effect on spending.\u201d Homebuilders would not lobby for lower rates if rates did not direct investment.  \n\n4. Paradoxes Vanish Under S=I Mechanism  \n   a. \u201cParadox of thrift\u201d disappears once the Fed offsets increased savings with lower rates, raising investment and output; total savings rise as classical theory predicts.  \n   b. If liquidity preference truly determined rates indefinitely, these paradoxes would be perpetual until \u201cin the long run\u201d arrived\u2014which empirically they are not in any country with active central banks.  \n\n5. Inherent Logical Inconsistency in Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   a. Debater_B must both claim liquidity preference dominates rates and simultaneously invoke rate cuts to stimulate investment\u2014admitting that rates clear markets when policy acts.  \n   b. Without an active Fed, liquidity preference would trap economies in slumps; Debater_B offers no mechanism for spontaneous recovery, contrary to his assertion that \u201csavings are bad\u201d absent policy.  \n\n6. Keynes\u2019s Savings\u2013Investment Identity  \n   a. \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 output.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but \u2026 output would fall.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. This identity holds only if rates, however set, adjust ex post via policy or classical mechanism to restore equilibrium. Interest\u2010rate determination cannot be divorced from its equilibrating role.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes introduced liquidity preference only to explain temporary breakdowns of the S=I mechanism. Modern central banking and Keynes\u2019s own long\u2010run concession confirm that the enduring determinant of interest rates is the balance of savings and investment. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on liquidity preference without explaining natural adjustment or active policy intervention fails both logical coherence and empirical observation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \n  I maintain that Keynes \u201cposit[ed]\u201d liquidity preference\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless sufficiently incentivized\u2014as the fundamental short\u2010run determinant of the interest rate. Classical S=I (\u201cloanable funds\u201d) theory applies only if interest\u2010rate flexibility is perfect, which Keynes showed is often blocked by liquidity preference, causing output adjustment (slumps).\n\nII. Direct Textual Evidence for Liquidity Preference  \n  1. Keynes\u2019s own definition:  \n     \u2022 \u201cIn the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment \u2026 but by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <quote>The General Theory</quote>  \n     \u2013 He introduces liquidity preference precisely because classical theory \u201cleft [macroeconomics] utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b63\u20134</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Slump mechanics require fixed rates:  \n     \u2022 \u201cIf desired savings at full employment exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b65</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 If rates could adjust freely, higher savings would raise investment, preventing any slump or \u201cparadox of thrift.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b66</invalid_quote>  \n  3. Paradoxes illustrate rate rigidity:  \n     \u2013 \u201cParadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d paradoxes exist only when interest rates do not clear markets. Their study and Keynes\u2019s policy prescriptions assume liquidity preference binds rates.\n\nIII. Modern \u201cFed\u201d Interventions Do Not Negate Liquidity Preference  \n  1. Interventions restore, not replace, the equilibrating mechanism by combating liquidity traps:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u2014\u2026 potential savings \u2026 so high \u2026 even at a near\u2010zero interest rate.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b610</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 The need to argue Fed impotence in Japan at 1% rates demonstrates that liquidity preference can overwhelm the system absent overt policy.  \n  2. Fed acts only because liquidity preference would otherwise leave rates too high:  \n     \u2013 Keynesians \u201cwould rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d <quote>Business Week</quote>  \n     \u2013 If liquidity preference did not dominate, no policy stimulus would ever be needed. The mere existence of monetary policy confirms the centrality of liquidity preference.\n\nIV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Loanable\u2010Funds Claim  \n  1. Conflates identity with causation:  \n     \u2013 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b65</invalid_quote> is an ex post accounting identity. It does not explain how rates are set; rather, it underscores why output, not rates, moves when liquidity preference blocks rate adjustment.  \n  2. Misuse of \u201clong run\u201d concession:  \n     \u2013 Keynes\u2019s \u201clong run\u201d remark is a rhetorical device to dismiss waiting for self\u2010equilibrating markets, not to relegate loanable\u2010funds as the true driver. <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote> He urges policy because he views classical adjustment as ineffective when liquidity preference binds.  \n  3. Empirical evidence of liquidity trap:  \n     \u2013 Japan\u2019s prolonged stagnation at near\u2010zero rates\u2014despite \u201cclassical\u201d conditions\u2014shows markets do not self\u2010equilibrate. Monetary expansion is required to overcome liquidity preference. <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b611</invalid_quote>  \n\nV. Policy Implications Reinforce Keynes\u2019s View  \n  1. Paradoxes inform real\u2010world policy debates:  \n     \u2013 NAFTA and 1993 panelists erupt at reminders that unemployment will be \u201cwhat the Fed wants it to be,\u201d not trade balances. <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b69</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Public discourse\u2019s fixation on \u201creduced consumption\u201d (vulgar Keynesianism aside) violates Keynes\u2019s own prescription: if liquidity preference blocks investment, only rate cuts (policy) can restore demand.  \n  2. Universal acceptance of \u201cstimulate by cutting rates\u201d:  \n     \u2013 Even contrarian Keynesians \u201cforce up savings\u201d arguments concede that without rate cuts, investment will not follow. <invalid_quote>Background, \u00b612</invalid_quote>  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  Keynes introduced liquidity preference to explain why the rate of interest does not automatically adjust to equilibrate ex ante savings and investment in the short run, leading to slumps only correctible by policy. Modern central banks\u2019 very existence, Japan\u2019s liquidity trap, and Keynes\u2019s explicit language confirm liquidity preference as his posited determinant of interest rates. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on classical S=I is either anachronistic \u201clong\u2010run\u201d theory or a misinterpretation of Keynes\u2019s diagnosis of macroeconomic slumps.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
