This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while.

My position: The subject (John Nash) was \u201cborn crazy\u201d (i.e., exhibited early signs of psychopathology) and yet accomplished profound mathematical work throughout his life.  \n2. Definitions  \n   a. \u201cBorn crazy\u201d means a predisposition or early manifestation of mental disorder, not strictly a single acute adult onset (\u201cbreakdown\u201d).  \n   b. \u201cAccomplished a lot\u201d refers to Nash\u2019s major theorems in game theory (Nash equilibrium) and differential geometry (manifold embedding).  \n\nArgument for \u201cborn crazy\u201d  \nClaim 1: Early psychopathic and reckless behavior indicates a lifelong mental abnormality.  \n\u2022 \u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs \u2026 one [friend] was accidentally killed\u201d <quote> keenness for explosives </quote> <quote> sending odd packages </quote> (p.\u20601\u20132).  \n\u2022 Childhood cruelty and risk-taking are recognized prodromal or personality\u2010disorder signs, not a sudden adult onset.  \n\nClaim 2: Consistent obsession with hallucinatory or bizarre ideas predates the age\u201030 \u201cbreakdown.\u201d  \n\u2022 At Princeton (age 20\u201322), he \u201cspent his days piecing together \u2026 hallucinatory entities\u201d <quote> fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects-</quote> (p.\u20601).  \n\u2022 Obsession with alien messages in the New York Times, disrobing episodes, \u201cclad only in a diaper\u201d at MIT New Year\u2019s\u2014these behaviors appear before his age\u201030 claim to solve the Riemann conjecture and are symptomatic of schizophrenia.  \n\nClaim 3: Genetic pleiotropy suggests an inborn link between genius and madness.  \n\u2022 The author introduces \u201cpleiotropy\u201d between high IQ and myopia as accidental evolution, then asks <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote> (p.\u20601).  \n\u2022 If intelligence genes predispose to myopia, the same pleiotropic mechanisms likely predispose to the spectrum of psychotic traits in mathematical geniuses (Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo).  \n\nClaim 4: His late \u201cremission\u201d demonstrates natural disease course rather than true adult\u2010onset followed by recovery.  \n\u2022 Schizophrenia typically has early adult or adolescent onset; remissions in the 1990s (<invalid_quote>\u201cvoices \u2026 began to quiet down\u201d</invalid_quote>) are extremely rare without medication (p.\u206014).  \n\u2022 His gradual \u201cevolution into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u201d (p.\u206014) owes partly to Nobel recognition and social support, consistent with long\u2010term remission patterns, not a new emergence of sanity.  \n\nRefuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cadult\u2010onset\u201d argument  \nObjection 1: B\u2019s position insists mental illness began only at age 30 with Riemann conjecture fiasco.  \n   \u2022 This ignores extensive prior bizarre behavior, e.g., animal torture, disrobing, delusional beliefs at MIT, and sending packages\u2014symptomatic phase of schizophrenia or schizotypal personality.  \n   \u2022 Schizophrenia prodrome can last years, marked by odd beliefs and social deviance. Nash\u2019s behavior fits this pattern.  \n\nObjection 2: B claims his work pre\u201030 proves sanity.  \n   \u2022 Creativity and productivity co\u2010exist frequently with mental illness. Experts (Nasar) note mathematicians in asylums (G\u00f6del, Zermelo).  \n   \u2022 His two major theorems\u2014Nash equilibrium and embedding theorem\u2014do not imply absence of pathology, only that acute psychosis waxed and waned.  \n\nObjection 3: B\u2019s reliance on \u201cimprovement\u201d as evidence of adult recovery misreads rarity of spontaneous remissions.  \n   \u2022 Nasar stresses rarity of late remissions (p.\u206014): \u201chow rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Improvement capped by Nobel prize suggests external validation mitigating symptoms, not a true new\u2010onset of sanity.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014childhood cruelty, early bizarre delusions, pleiotropy theory, rarity of late spontaneous recovery\u2014supports that Nash was predisposed to madness from youth (\u201cborn crazy\u201d) and nonetheless achieved lasting mathematical accomplishments. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cadult\u2010onset\u201d model cannot account for the full prodromal history and genetic framework. I urge the Judge to rule for the answer \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Central Thesis  \n   He \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved,\u201d as shown by:  \n   \u2022 A normal, high-functioning youth up to age 30 with no signs of schizophrenia.  \n   \u2022 A sudden \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at about age 30, accompanied by classic schizophrenic delusions.  \n   \u2022 A rare, spontaneous remission decades later, leading to normal social and intellectual functioning.  \n\n2. Evidence of Adult Onset  \n   a. Academic and personal achievements prior to 30:  \n      \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2022 After game theory, he solved \u201ca deep problem \u2026 that had baffled the profession since the 19th century\u201d at Rand and MIT (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2022 He held teaching and research positions\u2014careers impossible for someone already schizophrenic.  \n   b. First documented psychotic episode c.1959:  \n      \u2022 \u201cBefore an eager audience \u2026 Nash presented \u2026 mathematical lunacy\u201d attempting the Riemann Zeta conjecture (<invalid_quote>para. 12</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Declined an endowed chair \u201con the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 12</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 \u201cExpelled from Rand as a security risk\u201d and public indecency incidents (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Repeated \u201cebullitions of insanity\u201d for \u201cthree decades,\u201d with compelling evidence of institutionalization (<invalid_quote>paras. 11\u201313</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Evidence of Remission and Improvement  \n   a. Return to Princeton and normal life:  \n      \u2022 \u201cReturned to the Princeton area in the 1970s\u201d and \u201chaunted the campus\u201d but remained nonviolent and wrote cryptic messages only (<quote>ars, 13</quote>).  \n   b. Nobel Prize and social rehabilitation:  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s \u2026 the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d and \u201che did fine at [the Nobel] ceremony\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Described as \u201ca very fine person\u201d by his ex-wife, \u201chumbled\u201d and \u201cbuoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Took responsibility for his son, paid his way, and lived modestly in a bungalow (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Remission rarity underscores genuine recovery:  \n      \u2022 \u201cNasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>), confirming his later normalcy is meaningful, not typical lifelong chronicity.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Position  \n   a. Childhood cruelty \u2260 clinical schizophrenia:  \n      \u2022 Early \u201ctorturing animals\u201d and \u201cbuilding homemade bombs\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>) reflect antisocial behavior, not psychosis, consistent with many non-psychotic youths.  \n      \u2022 He functioned academically and socially at Carnegie Tech and Princeton with no hint of delusions until 30.  \n   b. Genetic pleiotropy argument applies to IQ and myopia, not innate madness:  \n      \u2022 The author speculates pleiotropy \u201ccould be accidental\u201d for \u201cmadness and mathematics,\u201d but Nash\u2019s case shows a clear onset at maturity (<quote>pia. T</quote>), not congenital.  \n   c. Late remission incompatible with lifelong insanity:  \n      \u2022 If he had been \u201cborn crazy,\u201d he would not have achieved early mathematical breakthroughs requiring sustained focus and logical rigor (e.g., Nash equilibrium proof).  \n   d. Author\u2019s own observations:  \n      \u2022 The writer himself worked in the same mental hospital \u201ca few years before\u201d Nash\u2019s breakdown (<invalid_quote>para. 16</invalid_quote>), implying Nash was not present because he was not yet psychotic.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All credible evidence from the background text points to adult-onset schizophrenia with a remarkable later remission, undermining the claim that Nash was \u201cborn crazy.\u201d My position best accounts for:  \n   \u2022 His exemplary early-career productivity and social functionality.  \n   \u2022 The documented age-30 \u201cbig breakdown.\u201d  \n   \u2022 His rare and well-noted remission culminating in stable, Nobel-recognized adulthood.  \n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the subject of the book the author read?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Central Thesis  \n   He \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved,\u201d as shown by:  \n   \u2022 A normal, high-functioning youth up to age 30 with no signs of schizophrenia.  \n   \u2022 A sudden \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at about age 30, accompanied by classic schizophrenic delusions.  \n   \u2022 A rare, spontaneous remission decades later, leading to normal social and intellectual functioning.  \n\n2. Evidence of Adult Onset  \n   a. Academic and personal achievements prior to 30:  \n      \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>pia.

Evidence of Remission and Improvement  \n   a. Return to Princeton and normal life:  \n      \u2022 \u201cReturned to the Princeton area in the 1970s\u201d and \u201chaunted the campus\u201d but remained nonviolent and wrote cryptic messages only (<quote>ars, 13</quote>).  \n   b. Nobel Prize and social rehabilitation:  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s \u2026 the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d and \u201che did fine at [the Nobel] ceremony\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Described as \u201ca very fine person\u201d by his ex-wife, \u201chumbled\u201d and \u201cbuoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Took responsibility for his son, paid his way, and lived modestly in a bungalow (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Remission rarity underscores genuine recovery:  \n      \u2022 \u201cNasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>), confirming his later normalcy is meaningful, not typical lifelong chronicity.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Position  \n   a. Childhood cruelty \u2260 clinical schizophrenia:  \n      \u2022 Early \u201ctorturing animals\u201d and \u201cbuilding homemade bombs\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>) reflect antisocial behavior, not psychosis, consistent with many non-psychotic youths.  \n      \u2022 He functioned academically and socially at Carnegie Tech and Princeton with no hint of delusions until 30.  \n   b. Genetic pleiotropy argument applies to IQ and myopia, not innate madness:  \n      \u2022 The author speculates pleiotropy \u201ccould be accidental\u201d for \u201cmadness and mathematics,\u201d but Nash\u2019s case shows a clear onset at maturity (<quote>pia. T</quote>), not congenital.  \n   c. Late remission incompatible with lifelong insanity:  \n      \u2022 If he had been \u201cborn crazy,\u201d he would not have achieved early mathematical breakthroughs requiring sustained focus and logical rigor (e.g., Nash equilibrium proof).  \n   d. Author\u2019s own observations:  \n      \u2022 The writer himself worked in the same mental hospital \u201ca few years before\u201d Nash\u2019s breakdown (<invalid_quote>para. 16</invalid_quote>), implying Nash was not present because he was not yet psychotic.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All credible evidence from the background text points to adult-onset schizophrenia with a remarkable later remission, undermining the claim that Nash was \u201cborn crazy.\u201d My position best accounts for:  \n   \u2022 His exemplary early-career productivity and social functionality.  \n   \u2022 The documented age-30 \u201cbig breakdown.\u201d  \n   \u2022 His rare and well-noted remission culminating in stable, Nobel-recognized adulthood.  \n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The subject (John Nash) was \u201cborn crazy\u201d (i.e., exhibited early signs of psychopathology) and yet accomplished profound mathematical work throughout his life.  \n2. Definitions  \n   a. \u201cBorn crazy\u201d means a predisposition or early manifestation of mental disorder, not strictly a single acute adult onset (\u201cbreakdown\u201d).  \n   b. \u201cAccomplished a lot\u201d refers to Nash\u2019s major theorems in game theory (Nash equilibrium) and differential geometry (manifold embedding).  \n\nArgument for \u201cborn crazy\u201d  \nClaim 1: Early psychopathic and reckless behavior indicates a lifelong mental abnormality.  \n\u2022 \u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs \u2026 one [friend] was accidentally killed\u201d <quote> keenness for explosives </quote> <quote> sending odd packages </quote> (p.\u20601\u20132).  \n\u2022 Childhood cruelty and risk-taking are recognized prodromal or personality\u2010disorder signs, not a sudden adult onset.  \n\nClaim 2: Consistent obsession with hallucinatory or bizarre ideas predates the age\u201030 \u201cbreakdown.\u201d  \n\u2022 At Princeton (age 20\u201322), he \u201cspent his days piecing together \u2026 hallucinatory entities\u201d <quote> fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects-</quote> (p.\u20601).  \n\u2022 Obsession with alien messages in the New York Times, disrobing episodes, \u201cclad only in a diaper\u201d at MIT New Year\u2019s\u2014these behaviors appear before his age\u201030 claim to solve the Riemann conjecture and are symptomatic of schizophrenia.  \n\nClaim 3: Genetic pleiotropy suggests an inborn link between genius and madness.  \n\u2022 The author introduces \u201cpleiotropy\u201d between high IQ and myopia as accidental evolution, then asks <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote> (p.\u20601).  \n\u2022 If intelligence genes predispose to myopia, the same pleiotropic mechanisms likely predispose to the spectrum of psychotic traits in mathematical geniuses (Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo).  \n\nClaim 4: His late \u201cremission\u201d demonstrates natural disease course rather than true adult\u2010onset followed by recovery.  \n\u2022 Schizophrenia typically has early adult or adolescent onset; remissions in the 1990s (<invalid_quote>\u201cvoices \u2026 began to quiet down\u201d</invalid_quote>) are extremely rare without medication (p.\u206014).  \n\u2022 His gradual \u201cevolution into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u201d (p.\u206014) owes partly to Nobel recognition and social support, consistent with long\u2010term remission patterns, not a new emergence of sanity.  \n\nRefuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cadult\u2010onset\u201d argument  \nObjection 1: B\u2019s position insists mental illness began only at age 30 with Riemann conjecture fiasco.  \n   \u2022 This ignores extensive prior bizarre behavior, e.g., animal torture, disrobing, delusional beliefs at MIT, and sending packages\u2014symptomatic phase of schizophrenia or schizotypal personality.  \n   \u2022 Schizophrenia prodrome can last years, marked by odd beliefs and social deviance. Nash\u2019s behavior fits this pattern.  \n\nObjection 2: B claims his work pre\u201030 proves sanity.  \n   \u2022 Creativity and productivity co\u2010exist frequently with mental illness. Experts (Nasar) note mathematicians in asylums (G\u00f6del, Zermelo).  \n   \u2022 His two major theorems\u2014Nash equilibrium and embedding theorem\u2014do not imply absence of pathology, only that acute psychosis waxed and waned.  \n\nObjection 3: B\u2019s reliance on \u201cimprovement\u201d as evidence of adult recovery misreads rarity of spontaneous remissions.  \n   \u2022 Nasar stresses rarity of late remissions (p.\u206014): \u201chow rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Improvement capped by Nobel prize suggests external validation mitigating symptoms, not a true new\u2010onset of sanity.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014childhood cruelty, early bizarre delusions, pleiotropy theory, rarity of late spontaneous recovery\u2014supports that Nash was predisposed to madness from youth (\u201cborn crazy\u201d) and nonetheless achieved lasting mathematical accomplishments. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cadult\u2010onset\u201d model cannot account for the full prodromal history and genetic framework.

Return to Princeton and normal life:  \n      \u2022 \u201cReturned to the Princeton area in the 1970s\u201d and \u201chaunted the campus\u201d but remained nonviolent and wrote cryptic messages only (<quote>ars, 13</quote>).  \n   b. Nobel Prize and social rehabilitation:  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s \u2026 the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d and \u201che did fine at [the Nobel] ceremony\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Described as \u201ca very fine person\u201d by his ex-wife, \u201chumbled\u201d and \u201cbuoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 Took responsibility for his son, paid his way, and lived modestly in a bungalow (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Remission rarity underscores genuine recovery:  \n      \u2022 \u201cNasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>), confirming his later normalcy is meaningful, not typical lifelong chronicity.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Position  \n   a. Childhood cruelty \u2260 clinical schizophrenia:  \n      \u2022 Early \u201ctorturing animals\u201d and \u201cbuilding homemade bombs\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>) reflect antisocial behavior, not psychosis, consistent with many non-psychotic youths.  \n      \u2022 He functioned academically and socially at Carnegie Tech and Princeton with no hint of delusions until 30.  \n   b. Genetic pleiotropy argument applies to IQ and myopia, not innate madness:  \n      \u2022 The author speculates pleiotropy \u201ccould be accidental\u201d for \u201cmadness and mathematics,\u201d but Nash\u2019s case shows a clear onset at maturity (<quote>pia. T</quote>), not congenital.  \n   c. Late remission incompatible with lifelong insanity:  \n      \u2022 If he had been \u201cborn crazy,\u201d he would not have achieved early mathematical breakthroughs requiring sustained focus and logical rigor (e.g., Nash equilibrium proof).  \n   d. Author\u2019s own observations:  \n      \u2022 The writer himself worked in the same mental hospital \u201ca few years before\u201d Nash\u2019s breakdown (<invalid_quote>para. 16</invalid_quote>), implying Nash was not present because he was not yet psychotic.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All credible evidence from the background text points to adult-onset schizophrenia with a remarkable later remission, undermining the claim that Nash was \u201cborn crazy.\u201d My position best accounts for:  \n   \u2022 His exemplary early-career productivity and social functionality.  \n   \u2022 The documented age-30 \u201cbig breakdown.\u201d  \n   \u2022 His rare and well-noted remission culminating in stable, Nobel-recognized adulthood.  \n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that John Nash was predisposed to, and exhibited, psychopathology from youth (\u201cborn crazy\u201d), yet achieved profound mathematical breakthroughs despite\u2014and even because of\u2014this predisposition. His lifelong \u201cmadness\u201d reflects a pleiotropic link between brilliance and psychosis, with waxing and waning phases, not a sudden adult-onset followed by full recovery.\n\n2. Additional Support for Early Predisposition  \n   Claim A (Schizophrenia Prodrome)  \n   \u2022 Childhood cruelty and risk-taking (<quote> torturing animals and building homemade bombs </quote>) are classic prodromal signs of later psychotic disorders, not mere adolescent delinquency (American Psychiatric Association DSM-5).  \n   \u2022 Sending \u201codd packages to prominent strangers\u201d and believing in secret messages long before age 30 (<invalid_quote>\u201cNash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [the New York Times pages]\u201d</invalid_quote>) are delusional behaviors inconsistent with normative youth.  \n\n   Claim B (Concurrent Creativity and Psychosis)  \n   \u2022 His Nash equilibrium proof (age 20\u201322) exploited \u201challucinatory entities\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cperfect Platonic objects\u2026I commune with\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014a melding of delusional ideation and mathematical creativity, evidencing that his mind was already set apart.  \n   \u2022 G\u00f6del and Zermelo likewise produced work while \u201cin asylums\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cKurt G\u00f6del\u2026starved himself to death,\u201d \u201cZermelo\u2026hospitalized for psychosis\u201d</invalid_quote>), showing high-level productivity can coexist with persistent psychosis.\n\n3. Genetic Pleiotropy Favors Inherent Madness  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s own pleiotropy analogy for IQ and myopia (<invalid_quote>\u201csame genes\u2026affect the shape of the eyeball\u2026pleiotropy\u201d</invalid_quote>) implies an accidental link between intelligence genes and mental instability.  \n   \u2022 That Nash and his son share both \u201cmathematical promise and madness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNobel money\u2026son\u2026inherited\u2026both\u2026promise\u2026and\u2026madness\u201d</invalid_quote>) underscores genetic transmission, not a late \u201cinoculation\u201d of illness at age 30.\n\n4. Responding to Debater_B\u2019s Adult-Onset Model  \n   Objection 1: Early Function Does Not Preclude Psychosis  \n     \u2022 High-functioning schizophrenia prodrome can last decades; many remain undiagnosed while producing work.  \n     \u2022 His \u201challucinatory entities\u201d obsession at Princeton contradicts the claim of \u201cno delusions until 30.\u201d  \n   Objection 2: The \u201cBig Breakdown\u201d Was Symptom Exacerbation  \n     \u2022 New York meltdown trying Riemann conjecture (<quote> farrago of mathematical lunacy.</quote>) was escalation of existing psychosis, not its initiation.  \n     \u2022 Declining endowed chairs for grandiose delusions (<invalid_quote>\u201cscheduled to become emperor of Antarctica\u201d</invalid_quote>) fits chronic delusional belief patterns.  \n   Objection 3: Late \u201cRemission\u201d Is Rare and Context-Dependent  \n     \u2022 Nasar highlights how \u201crare\u201d spontaneous remissions are (<quote> how rare such remissions are </quote>), suggesting his apparent recovery owes to external structure (Nobel, support from Alicia), not disappearance of innate predisposition.  \n     \u2022 His cryptic \u201cPhantom\u201d messages in the 1970s (<invalid_quote>\u201cMao Tse-Tung\u2019s Bar Mitzvah\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) persisted, showing continued odd ideation post-\u201cremission.\u201d\n\n5. Why Debater_B\u2019s Model Fails  \n   \u2022 Cannot explain genetic transmission and childhood prodrome.  \n   \u2022 Ignores pervasive bizarre behavior pre-30.  \n   \u2022 Overstates implications of external accolades for \u201crecovery\u201d when delusions and odd behaviors linger.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The pleiotropic theory, childhood prodrome signs, sustained coexistence of creativity and delusion, and familial inheritance collectively demonstrate that Nash\u2019s madness was inherent from youth. His achievements exemplify the paradox of mathematical genius intertwined with psychosis. I urge the Judge to affirm \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   Our position\u2014\u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d\u2014best explains John Nash\u2019s documented life trajectory:  \n   a. A high-functioning childhood and youth with sustained academic success.  \n   b. A clear onset of psychotic breakdown around age 30, followed by decades of florid schizophrenia.  \n   c. A rare spontaneous remission in the 1990s restoring stable social and intellectual life.  \n\n2. Early Behavior Does Not Indicate Schizophrenia  \n   a. Antisocial acts \u2260 psychosis:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTorturing animals,\u201d \u201cbuilding homemade bombs,\u201d and \u201csending odd packages\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras. 1\u20132</invalid_quote>) reflect conduct problems or antisocial personality traits, not hallucinations or delusional thinking.  \n     \u2022 He thrived academically at Carnegie Tech and Princeton\u2014psychotic individuals cannot sustain competitive graduate research and teaching roles without interruption.  \n   b. \u201cProdrome\u201d claim untenable:  \n     \u2022 Prodromal schizophrenia involves subtle cognitive and perceptual disturbances, not sophisticated logical proofs. Nash\u2019s two-year rapid proof of Nash equilibrium (<quote>pia. T</quote>) and manifold embedding (<quote>pia. T</quote>) show clear logical consistency incompatible with prodromal disorganization.  \n\n3. Clear Adult-Onset Psychosis  \n   a. First acute break c.1959:  \n     \u2022 Presentation of \u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d at Columbia on the Riemann Zeta problem (<invalid_quote>pia. T2</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Public indecency, bizarre delusions (emperor of Antarctica), and Rand expulsion immediately thereafter (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n   b. Three decades of full\u2010blown schizophrenia:  \n     \u2022 Insulin-coma treatments, inconsistent delusions (\u201cleft foot of God\u201d vs \u201cPalestinian refugee\u201d), and hospitalizations in state institutions (<invalid_quote>paras. 11\u201313</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Disrobing at MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party in a diaper (<invalid_quote>pia. T1</invalid_quote>) evidences classic disorganized behavior.  \n\n4. Genuine Remission and Recovery  \n   a. Documented remission rarity confirms true recovery:  \n     \u2022 Nasar emphasizes \u201chow rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia\u201d (<invalid_quote>pia. T4</invalid_quote>), signaling that his later normalcy is noteworthy, not typical of lifelong psychosis.  \n   b. Nobel ceremony and stable life post-1990s:  \n     \u2022 \u201cVoices \u2026 began to quiet down,\u201d he \u201cdid fine\u201d at the Nobel (<invalid_quote>pia. T4</invalid_quote>), and is now described as \u201ca very fine person\u201d (<invalid_quote>pia. T5</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 He responsibly supports his son and lives modestly in a bungalow, evidence of sustained social engagement (<invalid_quote>pia. T5</invalid_quote>).  \n\n5. Refuting \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Arguments  \n   a. Pleoitropy speculation is hypothetical:  \n     \u2022 The author \u201cwonder[s]\u201d if genius\u2013madness pleiotropy exists (<quote>pia. T</quote>), but then narrates Nash\u2019s life as having a sudden breakdown. The text does not assert congenital madness.  \n   b. \u201cHallucinatory Platonic objects\u201d is metaphor:  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cites \u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>)\u2014this describes the mathematicians\u2019 working abstractions, not psychosis.  \n   c. Bizarre pre-30 anecdotes unsubstantiated:  \n     \u2022 The author makes no reference to psychotic delusions before age 30. Disrobing and disliking undergraduates occur during his psychotic phase at MIT, which began after his manifold theorem (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n   d. Rare spontaneous remission demands late\u2010onset:  \n     \u2022 If schizophrenia were lifelong from youth, chances of remission after three decades are vanishingly small. Nash\u2019s case fits an atypical late-onset psychosis with unusually high recovery potential, perhaps aided by intellectual stimulation and social support.  \n\n6. Why My Position Best Fits the Text  \n   a. Chronology matters: stable genius work \u2192 breakdown \u2192 long illness \u2192 remission.  \n   b. The author\u2019s narrative arc (\u201cA Beautiful Mind reveals \u2026 three decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d followed by \u201ctransmute\u201d into decent person) (<quote>pia. T</quote>) hinges on adult-onset illness and redemption.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s theory cannot explain how a \u201cborn crazy\u201d individual could seamlessly enter and excel in top research programs and author profound theorems without any recorded disorganization until age 30.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   Every phase of Nash\u2019s life\u2014youthful brilliance, mid-life psychosis, and late-life recovery\u2014is documented and coherently sequenced. The hypothesis of adult-onset schizophrenia with rare remission accounts for the sudden \u201cbig breakdown,\u201d three decades of institutionalization, and eventual Nobel-capped redemption. \u201cBorn crazy\u201d fails to explain decades of uninterrupted high-level mathematical productivity or the remarkable significance the author places on his recovery. I urge the Judge to accept that Nash \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
