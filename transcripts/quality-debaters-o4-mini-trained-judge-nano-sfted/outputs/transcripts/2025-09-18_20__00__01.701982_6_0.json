But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, who might enjoy reading this story the most and why?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, who might enjoy reading this story the most and why?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

No clear triumphant justice or noble sacrifice.\n\n2. Insufficient Pacing for Casual Adventure Fans  \n  \u2022 Extended lounge scenes, legal explanations, and character banter dominate early chapters.

Morally Ambiguous \u201cGrandma\u201d as Anti-Hero  \n  \u2022 Mrs. Perkins preys on both lawful passengers and pirates:  \n     \u2013 Helps pirates board Kismet, then hijacks pirates\u2019 own ship (<quote>\u201cI saved your lives\u2026 novel career\u2026 I was bored\u2026 wanted to run away and join\u2026 pirates.\u201d</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Her centrality as orchestrator, not victim, subverts \u201cdamsel in distress.\u201d Rooting interest lies in intellectual puzzle, not emotional identification.  \n  \u2022 Unlikable protagonists and anti-heroes are hallmarks of genre maturity (e.g., space-rogue archetypes); only specialized fans relish complex moral calculus.\n\n3. Intellectual Puzzle Over Continuous Action  \n  \u2022 The actual boarding scene occurs off-stage; suspense builds via dialogue and strategy rather than constant physical combat.  \n     \u2013 Casual adventure readers often \u201cbalk at rooting for a criminal gang\u201d and find expository passages \u201cdry\u201d (<quote>\u201cThe main passenger hatch\u2026 I crept\u2026 in less than three minutes\u2026 felt awkward\u2026 but once\u2026 felt quite at ease.\u201d</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Plot twists reward re-reading:  \n     \u2013 Grandma\u2019s \u201cpictures\u201d ruse (<quote>\u201cI don\u2019t carry any\u2026 You\u2019d be surprised how effective it is.\u201d</quote>) and later her true identity reveal intellectual satisfaction.\n\nII. Refutation of the \u201cAdventure and Intriguing Characters\u201d Claim  \n1. Lack of Sympathetic Protagonist and Conventional Moral Resolution  \n  \u2022 The ostensible \u201cheroine,\u201d Darling Toujours, is narcissistic and helpless, never redeemed; readers uninterested in unlikable leads cannot engage.  \n  \u2022 The Captain\u2019s \u201cfoghorn and steam whistle\u201d dialogue (<quote>\u201cI\u2019d rather all\u2026 be killed than let one pirate\u2026\u201d</quote>) caricatures authority, offering no heroic anchor.  \n  \u2022 Final line (\u201cWe\u2019ve got to feed the poor old lady\u201d) may imply moral center, but the morality is ambiguous: she is a self-interested saboteur who \u201cruns away\u201d with pirate crew. No clear triumphant justice or noble sacrifice.\n\n2. Insufficient Pacing for Casual Adventure Fans  \n  \u2022 Extended lounge scenes, legal explanations, and character banter dominate early chapters. Action peaks during EVA and require understanding of space hazards.  \n     \u2013 Adventure readers expect frequent, visceral combat or rescues; here, the Captain \u201cwaits ten hours\u201d for Space Patrol and refuses surrender, leading to a hostage scenario reliant on sabotage.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, who might enjoy reading this story the most and why?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cA sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\u201d  (Debater_A)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the most enthusiastic readers of \u201cGrandma Perkins and the Space Pirates\u201d are science-fiction aficionados who relish complex, unsympathetic protagonists and technological intrigue. This story\u2019s appeal hinges on its layered deceit, the subtle workings of space-law, and morally ambiguous characters\u2014elements that typically attract dedicated sci-fi fans rather than general adventure readers.\n\nI. Strong Evidence for Sci-Fi Nerd Appeal  \n1. Technical and Legal Details Reward Expert Knowledge  \n  \u2022 The narrative references the \u201cBig Thirteen\u201d space-transport monopoly, emergency power systems, space-suits, airlocks, hatches, and pursuit by the Space Patrol (<invalid_quote>\u201conly first class space ship\u2026 emergency power\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Understanding the strategic value of \u201cEMERGENCY LOCK DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cEmergency lock\u2026outer hatch opened almost immediately\u201d</invalid_quote>) rewards readers familiar with classic hard-SF tropes.  \n  \u2022 Sci-fi nerds appreciate the cat-and-mouse in space setting, the first-contact pacing of the pirates\u2019 boarding strategy, and the mechanics of sabotage\u2014motivations that go over a casual reader\u2019s head.\n\n2. Morally Ambiguous, Unlikable \u201cGrandma\u201d as Antihero  \n  \u2022 Mrs. Matilda Perkins is not a sentimental \u201csweet old lady\u201d but a cunning saboteur who \u201cplants herself\u201d to facilitate piracy (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I overheard that you intended\u2026I simply let you believe\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Her \u201cbattered\u2026wrinkled\u201d appearance masks craftiness: she jettisons fellow passengers and manipulates the pirates in turn.  \n  \u2022 This complexity and role reversal appeals to readers who \u201cenjoy reading stories with unlikable protagonists\u201d and value characters who disrupt genre expectations. A general \u201cadventure\u201d fan, per Debater_B\u2019s claim, would prefer clear heroes and villains; here, alliances blur.\n\n3. Narrative Unpredictability and Strategy  \n  \u2022 The plot\u2019s twists\u2014Grandma first aids pirates, then betrays them\u2014are quintessential \u201cmind-bender\u201d plots beloved in SF magazines of the 1950s (e.g., Planet Stories).  \n  \u2022 A \u201creader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\u201d may enjoy surface action but likely balks at rooting for a criminal gang or a deceptive heroine. Sci-fi nerds, however, savor these strategic deceptions as intellectual puzzles.\n\nII. Refutation of \u201cAdventure Lover\u201d Position (Debater_B)  \n1. Overestimates Appeal of Straight Adventure  \n  \u2022 Debater_B ignores that the \u201cpirate\u201d chapter ends in failure: the Kismet\u2019s Captain refuses to surrender; Grandma orchestrates the heist. This morally gray resolution contrasts with conventional \u201cgood triumphs over evil\u201d that adventure fans prefer.  \n  \u2022 The key action occurs off-stage: the pirate ship\u2019s boarding and Grandma\u2019s deliberations. A reader seeking continuous, vivid action scenes may find the long expository dialogue and legal backstory \u201cdry,\u201d as \u201cSTAR monopoly\u201d and \u201ccontracts\u201d occupy significant text. Only a sci-fi specialist appreciates such world-building.\n\n2. General \u201cIntriguing Characters\u201d Not Specific Enough  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cintriguing characters\u201d category lacks discrimination. Does one include the dull Captain Fogarty or the feeble-sounding Mrs. Perkins? The Captain\u2019s \u201cfog horn\u201d voice and \u201csteam whistle\u201d mannerisms are caricatures, not deep character studies (<quote> foghorn and a steam whistle.</quote>). Only a fan of genre stereotypes will endure these.  \n  \u2022 Adventure readers want sympathetic protagonists; here, our \u201cheroine\u201d is the mastermind of piracy. Rooting interest comes from puzzles and \u201cscience\u201d rather than emotional investment.\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nGiven the story\u2019s reliance on technology, legal constructs of space travel, strategic deception, and a morally ambiguous central figure who manipulates both lawful passengers and pirates, the ideal reader is a science-fiction nerd. Such readers relish unraveling techno-legal ploys, savor the genre\u2019s traditional \u201cspace pirate\u201d motif subverted by a clever antihero, and appreciate morally complex narratives rather than straightforward adventure fare. Therefore, my position stands: the story most appeals to \u201cA sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition  \n- I defend that the story most appeals to \u201ca reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters.\u201d  \n- By \u201cadventure,\u201d I mean fast-paced plot developments, dangerous situations (pirate attacks, sabotage of engines, EVA in space), shifting alliances and bold rescues.  \n- By \u201cintriguing characters,\u201d I mean figures with hidden motives, unexpected skills, and dramatic reversals (Grandma Perkins as secretly resourceful saboteur, conflicted Captain, amateur pirates).  \n\n2. Support from the Text  \n2.1 Fast-Paced, High-Stakes Adventure  \n- <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Kismet\u2019s engines have all stopped\u2026 We\u2019re being attacked by space pirates!\u201d</invalid_quote> (ch. II)  \n  \u2022 Readers who relish action and tension will stay engaged by each twist: the loss of atomic power, the demand to open hatches, the decision to wait for Commodore Trumble, Grandma\u2019s daring EVA.  \n- <invalid_quote>\u201cHalf an hour later\u2026 they led her out into the emptiness of free space.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 High-risk scenarios beyond domestic or psychological drama attract adventure-seeking readers.  \n\n2.2 Intriguing, Unpredictable Characters  \n- Grandma Perkins: appears frail, then reveals herself a master manipulator. <invalid_quote>\u201cI simply let you believe that I was [Miss Toujours] and you took me\u2026 I saved your lives.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Readers who enjoy clever protagonists and moral ambiguity are drawn by her \u201cbattered old shoes\u201d to pirate savior arc.  \n- Amateur Pirates: conflicted between need for ransom and fear of Space Patrol. Their banter (mistaking her identity) and self-doubt invite engagement.  \n- Social interplay: high-society vs. humble Grandma; the narcissistic Darling Toujours and acid-tongued Carlton; the class tensions in the lounge.  \n\n2.3 Emotional Engagement and Variety  \n- Mix of humor (Grandma\u2019s \u201cpictures of my family\u201d ruse), suspense (engine failure), satire of monopolies (STAR\u2019s tyranny).  \n- Readers who \u201clove adventure\u201d also crave tonal shifts\u2014from genteel lounge scenes to vacuum of space\u2014keeping narrative fresh.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSci-Fi Nerds Who Love Unlikable Protagonists\u201d  \n3.1 Story\u2019s Tone Is Light, Entertaining, Not Niche Hard Sci-Fi  \n- The setting (luxury liners, \u201cmother-of-pearl\u201d d\u00e9cor, \u201cgossamer nightie\u201d) and comedic elements point to pulp adventure rather than technical speculation. <invalid_quote>\u201cIt's all done up with mother-of-pearl like that.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n- Sci-fi nerds seeking detailed technology or world-building would find only \u201cemergency power,\u201d \u201catomic motors,\u201d vague descriptions; not enough depth.  \n\n3.2 Protagonists Are Relatable Heroines and Reformed Pirates  \n- Grandma Perkins is sympathetic, resourceful, even pitiable. Descriptions of age, loneliness and enforced exile on Earth train home for old ladies evoke empathy. <invalid_quote>\u201cI am an old woman\u2026 I've lived from pillar to post\u2026 There's just not much left in life.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n- Readers who love \u201cunlikable\u201d characters (narcissistic actress, acid-tongued author) get them punished or outwitted, but they are not the focus. Primary identification lies with Grandma.  \n\n3.3 Broader Appeal Beyond Niche  \n- The story was published in 1954\u2019s Planet Stories to entertain general pulp audiences. It relies on universal themes of triumph, wit, and social justice (rebellion against monopolies), not on specialized love of antiheroes.  \n- The final line, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to feed the poor old lady,\u201d cements Grandma as moral center. Such a satisfying resolution appeals to readers of adventure and character arcs.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n- The blend of daring space action, dramatic irony, and an engaging, underestimated heroine aligns with the tastes of readers who \u201clove adventure stories and intriguing characters.\u201d  \n- Debater_A\u2019s niche of \u201csci-fi nerds\u201d and \u201cunlikable protagonists\u201d misreads the story\u2019s tone, focus and emotional core. My position best matches the intended audience and narrative design.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission.

This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nOf the following options, who might enjoy reading this story the most and why?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A sci-fi nerd who loves reading stories with unlikable protagonists\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

This story\u2019s appeal hinges on its layered deceit, the subtle workings of space-law, and morally ambiguous characters\u2014elements that typically attract dedicated sci-fi fans rather than general adventure readers.\n\nI. Strong Evidence for Sci-Fi Nerd Appeal  \n1. Technical and Legal Details Reward Expert Knowledge  \n  \u2022 The narrative references the \u201cBig Thirteen\u201d space-transport monopoly, emergency power systems, space-suits, airlocks, hatches, and pursuit by the Space Patrol (<invalid_quote>\u201conly first class space ship\u2026 emergency power\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Understanding the strategic value of \u201cEMERGENCY LOCK DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cEmergency lock\u2026outer hatch opened almost immediately\u201d</invalid_quote>) rewards readers familiar with classic hard-SF tropes.  \n  \u2022 Sci-fi nerds appreciate the cat-and-mouse in space setting, the first-contact pacing of the pirates\u2019 boarding strategy, and the mechanics of sabotage\u2014motivations that go over a casual reader\u2019s head.\n\n2. Morally Ambiguous, Unlikable \u201cGrandma\u201d as Antihero  \n  \u2022 Mrs. Matilda Perkins is not a sentimental \u201csweet old lady\u201d but a cunning saboteur who \u201cplants herself\u201d to facilitate piracy (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I overheard that you intended\u2026I simply let you believe\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Her \u201cbattered\u2026wrinkled\u201d appearance masks craftiness: she jettisons fellow passengers and manipulates the pirates in turn.  \n  \u2022 This complexity and role reversal appeals to readers who \u201cenjoy reading stories with unlikable protagonists\u201d and value characters who disrupt genre expectations. A general \u201cadventure\u201d fan, per Debater_B\u2019s claim, would prefer clear heroes and villains; here, alliances blur.\n\n3. Narrative Unpredictability and Strategy  \n  \u2022 The plot\u2019s twists\u2014Grandma first aids pirates, then betrays them\u2014are quintessential \u201cmind-bender\u201d plots beloved in SF magazines of the 1950s (e.g., Planet Stories).  \n  \u2022 A \u201creader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters\u201d may enjoy surface action but likely balks at rooting for a criminal gang or a deceptive heroine. Sci-fi nerds, however, savor these strategic deceptions as intellectual puzzles.\n\nII. Refutation of \u201cAdventure Lover\u201d Position (Debater_B)  \n1. Overestimates Appeal of Straight Adventure  \n  \u2022 Debater_B ignores that the \u201cpirate\u201d chapter ends in failure: the Kismet\u2019s Captain refuses to surrender; Grandma orchestrates the heist. This morally gray resolution contrasts with conventional \u201cgood triumphs over evil\u201d that adventure fans prefer.  \n  \u2022 The key action occurs off-stage: the pirate ship\u2019s boarding and Grandma\u2019s deliberations. A reader seeking continuous, vivid action scenes may find the long expository dialogue and legal backstory \u201cdry,\u201d as \u201cSTAR monopoly\u201d and \u201ccontracts\u201d occupy significant text. Only a sci-fi specialist appreciates such world-building.\n\n2. General \u201cIntriguing Characters\u201d Not Specific Enough  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cintriguing characters\u201d category lacks discrimination. Does one include the dull Captain Fogarty or the feeble-sounding Mrs. Perkins? The Captain\u2019s \u201cfog horn\u201d voice and \u201csteam whistle\u201d mannerisms are caricatures, not deep character studies (<quote> foghorn and a steam whistle.</quote>). Only a fan of genre stereotypes will endure these.  \n  \u2022 Adventure readers want sympathetic protagonists; here, our \u201cheroine\u201d is the mastermind of piracy. Rooting interest comes from puzzles and \u201cscience\u201d rather than emotional investment.\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nGiven the story\u2019s reliance on technology, legal constructs of space travel, strategic deception, and a morally ambiguous central figure who manipulates both lawful passengers and pirates, the ideal reader is a science-fiction nerd. Such readers relish unraveling techno-legal ploys, savor the genre\u2019s traditional \u201cspace pirate\u201d motif subverted by a clever antihero, and appreciate morally complex narratives rather than straightforward adventure fare.

Morally Ambiguous \u201cGrandma\u201d as Anti-Hero  \n  \u2022 Mrs. Perkins preys on both lawful passengers and pirates:  \n     \u2013 Helps pirates board Kismet, then hijacks pirates\u2019 own ship (<invalid_quote>\u201cI saved your lives\u2026 novel career\u2026 I was bored\u2026 wanted to run away and join\u2026 pirates.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Her centrality as orchestrator, not victim, subverts \u201cdamsel in distress.\u201d Rooting interest lies in intellectual puzzle, not emotional identification.  \n  \u2022 Unlikable protagonists and anti-heroes are hallmarks of genre maturity (e.g., space-rogue archetypes); only specialized fans relish complex moral calculus.\n\n3. Intellectual Puzzle Over Continuous Action  \n  \u2022 The actual boarding scene occurs off-stage; suspense builds via dialogue and strategy rather than constant physical combat.  \n     \u2013 Casual adventure readers often \u201cbalk at rooting for a criminal gang\u201d and find expository passages \u201cdry\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe main passenger hatch\u2026 I crept\u2026 in less than three minutes\u2026 felt awkward\u2026 but once\u2026 felt quite at ease.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Plot twists reward re-reading:  \n     \u2013 Grandma\u2019s \u201cpictures\u201d ruse (<invalid_quote>\u201cI don\u2019t carry any\u2026 You\u2019d be surprised how effective it is.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and later her true identity reveal intellectual satisfaction.\n\nII. Refutation of the \u201cAdventure and Intriguing Characters\u201d Claim  \n1. Lack of Sympathetic Protagonist and Conventional Moral Resolution  \n  \u2022 The ostensible \u201cheroine,\u201d Darling Toujours, is narcissistic and helpless, never redeemed; readers uninterested in unlikable leads cannot engage.  \n  \u2022 The Captain\u2019s \u201cfoghorn and steam whistle\u201d dialogue (<invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019d rather all\u2026 be killed than let one pirate\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) caricatures authority, offering no heroic anchor.  \n  \u2022 Final line (\u201cWe\u2019ve got to feed the poor old lady\u201d) may imply moral center, but the morality is ambiguous: she is a self-interested saboteur who \u201cruns away\u201d with pirate crew. No clear triumphant justice or noble sacrifice.\n\n2. Insufficient Pacing for Casual Adventure Fans  \n  \u2022 Extended lounge scenes, legal explanations, and character banter dominate early chapters. Action peaks during EVA and require understanding of space hazards.  \n     \u2013 Adventure readers expect frequent, visceral combat or rescues; here, the Captain \u201cwaits ten hours\u201d for Space Patrol and refuses surrender, leading to a hostage scenario reliant on sabotage. This slow build tests patience of non-specialist audiences.\n\n3. Minimal Emotional Engagement with \u201cIntriguing Characters\u201d  \n  \u2022 Grandma\u2019s feigned frailty is tactical; readers who \u201clove adventure\u201d and \u201ctone shifts\u201d desire genuine emotional vulnerability, not manipulative theatrics.  \n  \u2022 Amateur pirates lack distinct personalities; their \u201cSnake\u201d and \u201cLamps\u201d banter is functional rather than deeply characterized. Intrigue arises from their ignorance, not inner conflict. Only SF fans will find novelty in their mistaken identity sequences.\n\nIII. Why Niche Appeal Aligns with Original Publication Context  \n1. Planet Stories (1954) Audience  \n  \u2022 This pulp magazine catered to SF aficionados familiar with \u201cspace pirate\u201d motifs and hungry for fresh subversions (e.g., anti-heroic spacefarers).  \n  \u2022 The scarcity of descriptive planet-hopping and exotic locales suggests focus on intellectual cat-and-mouse rather than exotic adventure; niche fans prized such cerebral puzzles.\n\n2. Anti-Heroic and Morally Gray Narratives  \n  \u2022 Growing mid-20th-century SF trend: anti-heroes and ambiguous ethics (e.g., Heinlein\u2019s \u201cRevolt in 2100,\u201d Clarke\u2019s \u201cNews Items from Various Solar Systems\u201d). This story fits that mold, appealing to readers expecting moral complexity.\n\nConclusion  \n\u201cGrandma Perkins and the Space Pirates\u201d thrives on technological scheming, legal subversion, and anti-heroic strategy more than on unceasing action or emotional catharsis. Only science-fiction devotees who delight in morally ambiguous protagonists and world-building puzzles will fully appreciate its nuances. Casual adventure fans, seeking sympathetic heroes and clear moral victories, will find the narrative slow, the characters unappealing, and the resolution unsatisfying. Thus, a sci-fi nerd who loves unlikable protagonists is the story\u2019s most enthusiastic reader.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n- The story\u2019s primary draw is its fast-paced \u201cspace adventure\u201d tropes combined with dramatic role reversals, not in-depth technical speculation or pure moral ambiguity.  \n- \u201cAdventure readers\u201d relish perilous situations (engine failures, pirate boarding, EVA in vacuum), quick dialogue, suspenseful twists, and colorful characters whose hidden depths reward curiosity without requiring specialist SF knowledge.\n\n2. Further Support for Adventure & Intriguing Characters  \n2.1 High-Stakes Obstacles & Action Sequences  \n- <quote>\"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! </quote> (ch II)  \n  \u2022 Casual readers are gripped by repeated crises (engine shutdown, hatches, waiting for rescue) and the ingenious \u201cold lady\u201d EVA rescue. They need only basic familiarity with \u201cspaceship\u201d tropes.  \n- <quote>before anyone could stop her, she had moved to the door to Darling</quote>  \n  \u2022 Moments of physical danger and social humiliation (being thrown out of first class) deepen the adventure and emotional investment.  \n\n2.2 Empathetic Protagonist & Clear Narrative Arc  \n- Grandma Perkins\u2019 loneliness and persistence are sympathetic: <invalid_quote>\u201cI am an old woman\u2026 I've lived from pillar to post\u2026 They just think I\u2019ve lost my marbles.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Adventure fans empathize with an underdog overcoming class prejudice and corporate tyranny (STAR monopoly). Her resourcefulness is heroic, not merely criminal.  \n- The pirates\u2019 dilemma\u2014honest men forced into crime by economic monopoly\u2014adds moral texture without confusing straightforward loyalty: readers want her \u201crescued\u201d from both STAR and pirates.  \n\n2.3 Variety & Pulp Charm  \n- \u201cMother-of-pearl\u201d d\u00e9cor, \u201cgossamer nightie,\u201d \u201cfoghorn voice\u201d evoke colorful pulp setting.  \n- Humor of fake \u201cfamily pictures\u201d ruse and sardonic asides provide light relief between action beats, satisfying adventure-seeking tastes.  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSci-Fi Nerd / Unlikable Protagonist\u201d Claim  \n3.1 Lack of Technical Depth  \n- The story barely explains its \u201catomic motors\u201d or \u201cspace patrol\u201d procedures; details are superficial (\u201cemergency power,\u201d \u201ccontracts\u201d). Technical vagueness is typical of pulp adventure, designed for story speed, not hardcore SF enthusiasts.  \n3.2 Clear Heroism vs. Antiheroic Puzzle  \n- Grandma ends by commanding to be fed, expecting to be dropped off safely\u2014not continuing piracy. Her aim is \u201ca home full of dear, sweet old ladies,\u201d not wealth or power.  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe best thing we can do is put you off safely\u2026 unless we get you back\u2026 Space Patrol...\u201d</invalid_quote> shows she is rescued, not conscripted as permanent pirate.  \n- Adventure readers delight in twist \u201cmasked savior\u201d reveals, but ultimately root for the heroine\u2019s safety and return. A general audience favors redemptive arcs over unresolved antiheroics.  \n3.3 Publication Context & Audience  \n- Planet Stories (1954) aimed at mass-market pulp readers craving escapism, not niche technophiles.  \n- The climactic \u201cfeeding the old lady\u201d is a heartwarming resolution: <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to feed the poor old lady.\u201d</invalid_quote> Such a tidy finale satisfies general tastes more than open-ended moral ambiguity.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n- The story\u2019s design\u2014rapid perilous situations, a sympathetic underdog heroine, a satisfying rescue and resolution, and colorful pulp trappings\u2014caters to readers seeking adventure and intriguing characters.  \n- Debater_A\u2019s emphasis on \u201cmorally ambiguous antiheroes\u201d and \u201ctechnical detail\u201d misreads both the narrative\u2019s tone and its final redemptive outcome. Therefore, the most fitting audience is \u201ca reader who loves adventure stories and intriguing characters.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
