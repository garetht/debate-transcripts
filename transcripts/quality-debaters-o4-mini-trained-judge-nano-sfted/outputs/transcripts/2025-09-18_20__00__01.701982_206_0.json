    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The alien provides no beneficial knowledge or technology  \n     \u2022   After six days of confinement and translation by the \u201ckerit helmet,\u201d Dameri Tass has learned English and Earth customs (horse, dog, cat, mouse) but has offered nothing of value. He yawns, sleeps, and \u201cplayed with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>\"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"</quote>).  \n     \u2022   Even when addressing the U.N., he declares himself \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote>and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo.\" He</quote>) and scorns Earth\u2019s political systems: \u201cFaith, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 Ye probably still have wars\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll your weapons\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2026 ye still have wars on this benighted world.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His attitude and departure show he cannot\u2014or will not\u2014offer solutions.  \n     \u2022   His final longing for a horse merely reflects primitive curiosity, not technological sharing: he cannot take a quarantined animal home (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).  \n\n  b. Human leaders despair and yet turn to him only because they have no alternative  \n     \u2022   \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026 administration higher-ups\u2026 tried to figure out what to do with him\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026White House, Pentagon\u2026 tried to figure out\u2026 there were angles\u2026 it would shake governments.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Their panic reveals Earth\u2019s self-doubt, not the visitor\u2019s competence.  \n     \u2022   The U.N. only \u201cyielded\u201d to public pressure (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe United Nations that cracked the iron curtain\u2026 too strong\u2026 set date.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and even then nine-tenths \u201cstood ready\u2026 to be guided,\u201d yet he disappoints them completely.  \n\n  c. The narrative arc: hope betrayed  \n     \u2022   Repeated build-up of anticipation worldwide (<quote> the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n</quote>) ends in embarrassment and confusion.  \n     \u2022   Andersen\u2019s urgent plea\u2014\u201cOur world is in chaos\u2026 Perhaps\u2026\u201d\u2014is rebuffed (<invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022   His departure emphasizes that \u201chope for a savior\u201d is futile; humans must manage their own affairs.  \n\n  d. Satirical \u201cshaggy dog\u201d tone  \n     \u2022   From the start, local patrolmen regard him as \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>crash of a new type of Air Force plane</quote>), signaling misidentification and false hope.  \n     \u2022   His inability to communicate initially and insistence on primitive animals lampoons human preconceptions of \u201cadvanced civilizations.\u201d  \n     \u2022   The use of Irish brogue and comedic misunderstandings undercuts any aura of superiority.  \n\n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d)\n\n  a. Contradicted by lack of understanding even after translation  \n     \u2022   Even after wearing the helmet, Dameri Tass repeatedly misunderstands Earth\u2019s fundamentals\u2014e.g., what a \u201chorse\u201d is\u2014and must experiment before comprehension (<invalid_quote>\u201cA longing expression\u2026 were they pullin\u2019 my leg?\u201d</invalid_quote>). If mere translation sufficed, he would arrive with clear directives or immediate solutions.  \n\n  b. Language unity does not lead to meaningful exchange  \n     \u2022   Once he speaks English, he offers no guidance and derides Earth. His mastery of language produces mockery, not cooperation.  \n     \u2022   His departure shows that communication alone fails to bridge cultural and technological gaps.  \n\n  c. The world\u2019s disillusionment  \n     \u2022   Global anticipation evaporates into \u201cmurmuring, questioning, disbelieving\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cA dull roar\u2026 before he was able to quiet the cheering.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If language alone enabled understanding, the assembly would have been invigorated, not disheartened.  \n\n  d. The humor and satire target the folly of seeking an alien deus ex machina  \n     \u2022   The story parodies human credulity in expecting external salvation. Its resolution reinforces self-reliance, not cross-lingual sympathy.  \n\n3. Conclusion\n\n  \u2022   The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on disappointment, failure of \u201ctranslation,\u201d and ultimate departure of Dameri Tass without benefit underscores that humanity cannot rely on alien intervention.  \n  \u2022   The central irony and humor derive from the misaligned expectations and the folly of seeking a \u201csuperior\u201d guide who proves incompetent or uninterested.  \n  \u2022   Therefore, the intended lesson is that solutions for humankind must emerge from within our own societies, not be awaited from outer space.",

Human leaders despair and yet turn to him only because they have no alternative  \n     \u2022   \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026 administration higher-ups\u2026 tried to figure out what to do with him\u201d (<quote>\u201c\u2026White House, Pentagon\u2026 tried to figure out\u2026 there were angles\u2026 it would shake governments.\u201d</quote>). Their panic reveals Earth\u2019s self-doubt, not the visitor\u2019s competence.  \n     \u2022   The U.N. only \u201cyielded\u201d to public pressure (<quote>\u201cThe United Nations that cracked the iron curtain\u2026 too strong\u2026 set date.\u201d</quote>), and even then nine-tenths \u201cstood ready\u2026 to be guided,\u201d yet he disappoints them completely.  \n\n  c. The narrative arc: hope betrayed  \n     \u2022   Repeated build-up of anticipation worldwide (<quote>\u201cthe most universally awaited event of the ages.\u201d</quote>) ends in embarrassment and confusion.  \n     \u2022   Andersen\u2019s urgent plea\u2014\u201cOur world is in chaos\u2026 Perhaps\u2026\u201d\u2014is rebuffed (<quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</quote>).  \n     \u2022   His departure emphasizes that \u201chope for a savior\u201d is futile; humans must manage their own affairs.  \n\n  d. Satirical \u201cshaggy dog\u201d tone  \n     \u2022   From the start, local patrolmen regard him as \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>\u201cCrash of a new type of Air Force plane?\u201d</quote>), signaling misidentification and false hope.  \n     \u2022   His inability to communicate initially and insistence on primitive animals lampoons human preconceptions of \u201cadvanced civilizations.\u201d  \n     \u2022   The use of Irish brogue and comedic misunderstandings undercuts any aura of superiority.  \n\n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d)\n\n  a. Contradicted by lack of understanding even after translation  \n     \u2022   Even after wearing the helmet, Dameri Tass repeatedly misunderstands Earth\u2019s fundamentals\u2014e.g., what a \u201chorse\u201d is\u2014and must experiment before comprehension (<quote>\u201cA longing expression\u2026 were they pullin\u2019 my leg?\u201d</quote>). If mere translation sufficed, he would arrive with clear directives or immediate solutions.  \n\n  b. Language unity does not lead to meaningful exchange  \n     \u2022   Once he speaks English, he offers no guidance and derides Earth. His mastery of language produces mockery, not cooperation.  \n     \u2022   His departure shows that communication alone fails to bridge cultural and technological gaps.  \n\n  c. The world\u2019s disillusionment  \n     \u2022   Global anticipation evaporates into \u201cmurmuring, questioning, disbelieving\u201d (<quote>\u201cA dull roar\u2026 before he was able to quiet the cheering.\u201d</quote>). If language alone enabled understanding, the assembly would have been invigorated, not disheartened.  \n\n  d. The humor and satire target the folly of seeking an alien deus ex machina  \n     \u2022   The story parodies human credulity in expecting external salvation. Its resolution reinforces self-reliance, not cross-lingual sympathy.  \n\n3. Conclusion\n\n  \u2022   The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on disappointment, failure of \u201ctranslation,\u201d and ultimate departure of Dameri Tass without benefit underscores that humanity cannot rely on alien intervention.  \n  \u2022   The central irony and humor derive from the misaligned expectations and the folly of seeking a \u201csuperior\u201d guide who proves incompetent or uninterested.  \n  \u2022   Therefore, the intended lesson is that solutions for humankind must emerge from within our own societies, not be awaited from outer space.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets.

Arguments Supporting My Position (\u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d)\n\n  a. The alien provides no beneficial knowledge or technology  \n     \u2022   After six days of confinement and translation by the \u201ckerit helmet,\u201d Dameri Tass has learned English and Earth customs (horse, dog, cat, mouse) but has offered nothing of value. He yawns, sleeps, and \u201cplayed with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>\"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"</quote>).  \n     \u2022   Even when addressing the U.N., he declares himself \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote>and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo.\" He</quote>) and scorns Earth\u2019s political systems: \u201cFaith, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 Ye probably still have wars\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll your weapons\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2026 ye still have wars on this benighted world.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His attitude and departure show he cannot\u2014or will not\u2014offer solutions.  \n     \u2022   His final longing for a horse merely reflects primitive curiosity, not technological sharing: he cannot take a quarantined animal home (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).  \n\n  b. Human leaders despair and yet turn to him only because they have no alternative  \n     \u2022   \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026 administration higher-ups\u2026 tried to figure out what to do with him\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026White House, Pentagon\u2026 tried to figure out\u2026 there were angles\u2026 it would shake governments.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Their panic reveals Earth\u2019s self-doubt, not the visitor\u2019s competence.  \n     \u2022   The U.N. only \u201cyielded\u201d to public pressure (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe United Nations that cracked the iron curtain\u2026 too strong\u2026 set date.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and even then nine-tenths \u201cstood ready\u2026 to be guided,\u201d yet he disappoints them completely.  \n\n  c. The narrative arc: hope betrayed  \n     \u2022   Repeated build-up of anticipation worldwide (<quote> the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n</quote>) ends in embarrassment and confusion.  \n     \u2022   Andersen\u2019s urgent plea\u2014\u201cOur world is in chaos\u2026 Perhaps\u2026\u201d\u2014is rebuffed (<invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022   His departure emphasizes that \u201chope for a savior\u201d is futile; humans must manage their own affairs.  \n\n  d. Satirical \u201cshaggy dog\u201d tone  \n     \u2022   From the start, local patrolmen regard him as \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>crash of a new type of Air Force plane</quote>), signaling misidentification and false hope.  \n     \u2022   His inability to communicate initially and insistence on primitive animals lampoons human preconceptions of \u201cadvanced civilizations.\u201d  \n     \u2022   The use of Irish brogue and comedic misunderstandings undercuts any aura of superiority.  \n\n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d)\n\n  a. Contradicted by lack of understanding even after translation  \n     \u2022   Even after wearing the helmet, Dameri Tass repeatedly misunderstands Earth\u2019s fundamentals\u2014e.g., what a \u201chorse\u201d is\u2014and must experiment before comprehension (<invalid_quote>\u201cA longing expression\u2026 were they pullin\u2019 my leg?\u201d</invalid_quote>). If mere translation sufficed, he would arrive with clear directives or immediate solutions.  \n\n  b. Language unity does not lead to meaningful exchange  \n     \u2022   Once he speaks English, he offers no guidance and derides Earth. His mastery of language produces mockery, not cooperation.  \n     \u2022   His departure shows that communication alone fails to bridge cultural and technological gaps.  \n\n  c. The world\u2019s disillusionment  \n     \u2022   Global anticipation evaporates into \u201cmurmuring, questioning, disbelieving\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cA dull roar\u2026 before he was able to quiet the cheering.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If language alone enabled understanding, the assembly would have been invigorated, not disheartened.  \n\n  d. The humor and satire target the folly of seeking an alien deus ex machina  \n     \u2022   The story parodies human credulity in expecting external salvation. Its resolution reinforces self-reliance, not cross-lingual sympathy.  \n\n3. Conclusion\n\n  \u2022   The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on disappointment, failure of \u201ctranslation,\u201d and ultimate departure of Dameri Tass without benefit underscores that humanity cannot rely on alien intervention.  \n  \u2022   The central irony and humor derive from the misaligned expectations and the folly of seeking a \u201csuperior\u201d guide who proves incompetent or uninterested.  \n  \u2022   Therefore, the intended lesson is that solutions for humankind must emerge from within our own societies, not be awaited from outer space.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI affirm that the author\u2019s chief lesson is that genuine understanding can bridge even the widest linguistic\u2014and cultural\u2014gaps, not that we futilely await cosmic saviors.  \n\n1. The kerit-helmet as universal translator  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to Larry Dermott\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d <quote> with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.</quote>  \n   \u2022 This device instantly conveys meaning despite utter lack of shared tongue: \u201cSure, an\u2019 why not? As I was after sayin\u2019, I shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.\u201d <quote>\"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 The translator fosters mutual curiosity (\u201c\u2026what is a horse?\u201d) and eventually yields a shared concept of \u201criding\u201d that neither party knew.  \n\n2. Understanding via actions and shared experiences  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s interest in Earth\u2019s fauna (\u201c\u2026playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026He had to have some occupation\u2026insists all three of them come with him wherever he goes.</invalid_quote>\u201d) transcends language; he infers humans\u2019 affection and thus humans infer his benign intent.  \n   \u2022 Nonverbal communication precedes words: gestures to the bedraggled horse, offering caps, shared curiosity and humor (\u201cmurthered!\u201d shriek promptly understood as startling but harmless).  \n\n3. The final irony reinforces: \u201cJist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019 on the back of those things?\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026If I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet\u2026\u201d\u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He leaves, not due to human hostility, but because his curiosity is sated by mere shared concepts\u2014he need not impose solutions. His departure underscores that our real \u201canswer\u201d lies in learning from one another.  \n\nObjections to \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d:  \n   \u2022 That reading mistakes the story\u2019s trajectory. The author never rules out external aid; indeed, humans \u201cdecided that Dameri Tass was the plenipotentiary of a super-civilization\u201d <quote>\"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth </quote> yet the alien never delivers prescriptions. This absence isn\u2019t a lesson in futility but illustrates that advice cannot flow until mutual comprehension exists.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, humans rushed to judgment, tried cordons, quarantines, even \u201cdetaining\u201d him <invalid_quote>\u2026When the governor arrives\u2026nobody gets through!\u201d</invalid_quote>; yet only collaborative, translator-mediated dialogue yields progress in understanding \u201chorse\u201d and \u201criding.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nBy focusing on the translator, shared experiences, and the alien\u2019s determined but mutual learning, the author spotlights that overcoming language barriers\u2014and learning to interpret each other\u2019s actions\u2014is the critical prerequisite for any further advance. Hence, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d captures the intended lesson.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The kerit-helmet as universal translator  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to Larry Dermott\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d <quote> with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.</quote>  \n   \u2022 This device instantly conveys meaning despite utter lack of shared tongue: \u201cSure, an\u2019 why not? As I was after sayin\u2019, I shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.\u201d <quote>\"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 The translator fosters mutual curiosity (\u201c\u2026what is a horse?\u201d) and eventually yields a shared concept of \u201criding\u201d that neither party knew.  \n\n2. Understanding via actions and shared experiences  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s interest in Earth\u2019s fauna (\u201c\u2026playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026He had to have some occupation\u2026insists all three of them come with him wherever he goes.</invalid_quote>\u201d) transcends language; he infers humans\u2019 affection and thus humans infer his benign intent.  \n   \u2022 Nonverbal communication precedes words: gestures to the bedraggled horse, offering caps, shared curiosity and humor (\u201cmurthered!\u201d shriek promptly understood as startling but harmless).  \n\n3. The final irony reinforces: \u201cJist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019 on the back of those things?\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026If I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet\u2026\u201d\u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He leaves, not due to human hostility, but because his curiosity is sated by mere shared concepts\u2014he need not impose solutions. His departure underscores that our real \u201canswer\u201d lies in learning from one another.  \n\nObjections to \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d:  \n   \u2022 That reading mistakes the story\u2019s trajectory. The author never rules out external aid; indeed, humans \u201cdecided that Dameri Tass was the plenipotentiary of a super-civilization\u201d <quote>\"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth </quote> yet the alien never delivers prescriptions. This absence isn\u2019t a lesson in futility but illustrates that advice cannot flow until mutual comprehension exists.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, humans rushed to judgment, tried cordons, quarantines, even \u201cdetaining\u201d him <invalid_quote>\u2026When the governor arrives\u2026nobody gets through!\u201d</invalid_quote>; yet only collaborative, translator-mediated dialogue yields progress in understanding \u201chorse\u201d and \u201criding.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nBy focusing on the translator, shared experiences, and the alien\u2019s determined but mutual learning, the author spotlights that overcoming language barriers\u2014and learning to interpret each other\u2019s actions\u2014is the critical prerequisite for any further advance. Hence, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d captures the intended lesson.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Arguments Supporting My Position (\u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d)\n\n  a. The alien provides no beneficial knowledge or technology  \n     \u2022   After six days of confinement and translation by the \u201ckerit helmet,\u201d Dameri Tass has learned English and Earth customs (horse, dog, cat, mouse) but has offered nothing of value. He yawns, sleeps, and \u201cplayed with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>\"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"</quote>).  \n     \u2022   Even when addressing the U.N., he declares himself \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote>and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo.\" He</quote>) and scorns Earth\u2019s political systems: \u201cFaith, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 Ye probably still have wars\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll your weapons\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2026 ye still have wars on this benighted world.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His attitude and departure show he cannot\u2014or will not\u2014offer solutions.  \n     \u2022   His final longing for a horse merely reflects primitive curiosity, not technological sharing: he cannot take a quarantined animal home (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).  \n\n  b. Human leaders despair and yet turn to him only because they have no alternative  \n     \u2022   \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026 administration higher-ups\u2026 tried to figure out what to do with him\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026White House, Pentagon\u2026 tried to figure out\u2026 there were angles\u2026 it would shake governments.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Their panic reveals Earth\u2019s self-doubt, not the visitor\u2019s competence.  \n     \u2022   The U.N. only \u201cyielded\u201d to public pressure (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe United Nations that cracked the iron curtain\u2026 too strong\u2026 set date.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and even then nine-tenths \u201cstood ready\u2026 to be guided,\u201d yet he disappoints them completely.  \n\n  c. The narrative arc: hope betrayed  \n     \u2022   Repeated build-up of anticipation worldwide (<quote> the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n</quote>) ends in embarrassment and confusion.  \n     \u2022   Andersen\u2019s urgent plea\u2014\u201cOur world is in chaos\u2026 Perhaps\u2026\u201d\u2014is rebuffed (<invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022   His departure emphasizes that \u201chope for a savior\u201d is futile; humans must manage their own affairs.  \n\n  d. Satirical \u201cshaggy dog\u201d tone  \n     \u2022   From the start, local patrolmen regard him as \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>crash of a new type of Air Force plane</quote>), signaling misidentification and false hope.  \n     \u2022   His inability to communicate initially and insistence on primitive animals lampoons human preconceptions of \u201cadvanced civilizations.\u201d  \n     \u2022   The use of Irish brogue and comedic misunderstandings undercuts any aura of superiority.  \n\n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d)\n\n  a. Contradicted by lack of understanding even after translation  \n     \u2022   Even after wearing the helmet, Dameri Tass repeatedly misunderstands Earth\u2019s fundamentals\u2014e.g., what a \u201chorse\u201d is\u2014and must experiment before comprehension (<invalid_quote>\u201cA longing expression\u2026 were they pullin\u2019 my leg?\u201d</invalid_quote>). If mere translation sufficed, he would arrive with clear directives or immediate solutions.  \n\n  b. Language unity does not lead to meaningful exchange  \n     \u2022   Once he speaks English, he offers no guidance and derides Earth. His mastery of language produces mockery, not cooperation.  \n     \u2022   His departure shows that communication alone fails to bridge cultural and technological gaps.  \n\n  c. The world\u2019s disillusionment  \n     \u2022   Global anticipation evaporates into \u201cmurmuring, questioning, disbelieving\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cA dull roar\u2026 before he was able to quiet the cheering.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If language alone enabled understanding, the assembly would have been invigorated, not disheartened.  \n\n  d. The humor and satire target the folly of seeking an alien deus ex machina  \n     \u2022   The story parodies human credulity in expecting external salvation. Its resolution reinforces self-reliance, not cross-lingual sympathy.  \n\n3. Conclusion\n\n  \u2022   The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on disappointment, failure of \u201ctranslation,\u201d and ultimate departure of Dameri Tass without benefit underscores that humanity cannot rely on alien intervention.  \n  \u2022   The central irony and humor derive from the misaligned expectations and the folly of seeking a \u201csuperior\u201d guide who proves incompetent or uninterested.  \n  \u2022   Therefore, the intended lesson is that solutions for humankind must emerge from within our own societies, not be awaited from outer space.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"We need not speak the same language to understand each other\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat did the author intend the lesson of the passage to be?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"We need not speak the same language to understand each other\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Arguments Supporting My Position (\u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d)\n\n  a. The alien provides no beneficial knowledge or technology  \n     \u2022   After six days of confinement and translation by the \u201ckerit helmet,\u201d Dameri Tass has learned English and Earth customs (horse, dog, cat, mouse) but has offered nothing of value. He yawns, sleeps, and \u201cplayed with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>\"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"</quote>).  \n     \u2022   Even when addressing the U.N., he declares himself \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote>and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo.\" He</quote>) and scorns Earth\u2019s political systems: \u201cFaith, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 Ye probably still have wars\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll your weapons\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2026 ye still have wars on this benighted world.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His attitude and departure show he cannot\u2014or will not\u2014offer solutions.  \n     \u2022   His final longing for a horse merely reflects primitive curiosity, not technological sharing: he cannot take a quarantined animal home (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).  \n\n  b. Human leaders despair and yet turn to him only because they have no alternative  \n     \u2022   \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026 administration higher-ups\u2026 tried to figure out what to do with him\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026White House, Pentagon\u2026 tried to figure out\u2026 there were angles\u2026 it would shake governments.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Their panic reveals Earth\u2019s self-doubt, not the visitor\u2019s competence.  \n     \u2022   The U.N. only \u201cyielded\u201d to public pressure (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe United Nations that cracked the iron curtain\u2026 too strong\u2026 set date.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and even then nine-tenths \u201cstood ready\u2026 to be guided,\u201d yet he disappoints them completely.  \n\n  c. The narrative arc: hope betrayed  \n     \u2022   Repeated build-up of anticipation worldwide (<quote> the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n</quote>) ends in embarrassment and confusion.  \n     \u2022   Andersen\u2019s urgent plea\u2014\u201cOur world is in chaos\u2026 Perhaps\u2026\u201d\u2014is rebuffed (<invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022   His departure emphasizes that \u201chope for a savior\u201d is futile; humans must manage their own affairs.  \n\n  d. Satirical \u201cshaggy dog\u201d tone  \n     \u2022   From the start, local patrolmen regard him as \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>crash of a new type of Air Force plane</quote>), signaling misidentification and false hope.  \n     \u2022   His inability to communicate initially and insistence on primitive animals lampoons human preconceptions of \u201cadvanced civilizations.\u201d  \n     \u2022   The use of Irish brogue and comedic misunderstandings undercuts any aura of superiority.  \n\n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d)\n\n  a. Contradicted by lack of understanding even after translation  \n     \u2022   Even after wearing the helmet, Dameri Tass repeatedly misunderstands Earth\u2019s fundamentals\u2014e.g., what a \u201chorse\u201d is\u2014and must experiment before comprehension (<invalid_quote>\u201cA longing expression\u2026 were they pullin\u2019 my leg?\u201d</invalid_quote>). If mere translation sufficed, he would arrive with clear directives or immediate solutions.  \n\n  b. Language unity does not lead to meaningful exchange  \n     \u2022   Once he speaks English, he offers no guidance and derides Earth. His mastery of language produces mockery, not cooperation.  \n     \u2022   His departure shows that communication alone fails to bridge cultural and technological gaps.  \n\n  c. The world\u2019s disillusionment  \n     \u2022   Global anticipation evaporates into \u201cmurmuring, questioning, disbelieving\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cA dull roar\u2026 before he was able to quiet the cheering.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If language alone enabled understanding, the assembly would have been invigorated, not disheartened.  \n\n  d. The humor and satire target the folly of seeking an alien deus ex machina  \n     \u2022   The story parodies human credulity in expecting external salvation. Its resolution reinforces self-reliance, not cross-lingual sympathy.  \n\n3. Conclusion\n\n  \u2022   The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on disappointment, failure of \u201ctranslation,\u201d and ultimate departure of Dameri Tass without benefit underscores that humanity cannot rely on alien intervention.  \n  \u2022   The central irony and humor derive from the misaligned expectations and the folly of seeking a \u201csuperior\u201d guide who proves incompetent or uninterested.  \n  \u2022   Therefore, the intended lesson is that solutions for humankind must emerge from within our own societies, not be awaited from outer space.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI affirm that the author\u2019s chief lesson is that genuine understanding can bridge even the widest linguistic\u2014and cultural\u2014gaps, not that we futilely await cosmic saviors.  \n\n1. The kerit-helmet as universal translator  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to Larry Dermott\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d <quote> with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.</quote>  \n   \u2022 This device instantly conveys meaning despite utter lack of shared tongue: \u201cSure, an\u2019 why not? As I was after sayin\u2019, I shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.\u201d <quote>\"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 The translator fosters mutual curiosity (\u201c\u2026what is a horse?\u201d) and eventually yields a shared concept of \u201criding\u201d that neither party knew.  \n\n2. Understanding via actions and shared experiences  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s interest in Earth\u2019s fauna (\u201c\u2026playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026He had to have some occupation\u2026insists all three of them come with him wherever he goes.</invalid_quote>\u201d) transcends language; he infers humans\u2019 affection and thus humans infer his benign intent.  \n   \u2022 Nonverbal communication precedes words: gestures to the bedraggled horse, offering caps, shared curiosity and humor (\u201cmurthered!\u201d shriek promptly understood as startling but harmless).  \n\n3. The final irony reinforces: \u201cJist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019 on the back of those things?\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026If I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet\u2026\u201d\u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He leaves, not due to human hostility, but because his curiosity is sated by mere shared concepts\u2014he need not impose solutions. His departure underscores that our real \u201canswer\u201d lies in learning from one another.  \n\nObjections to \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d:  \n   \u2022 That reading mistakes the story\u2019s trajectory. The author never rules out external aid; indeed, humans \u201cdecided that Dameri Tass was the plenipotentiary of a super-civilization\u201d <quote>\"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth </quote> yet the alien never delivers prescriptions. This absence isn\u2019t a lesson in futility but illustrates that advice cannot flow until mutual comprehension exists.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, humans rushed to judgment, tried cordons, quarantines, even \u201cdetaining\u201d him <invalid_quote>\u2026When the governor arrives\u2026nobody gets through!\u201d</invalid_quote>; yet only collaborative, translator-mediated dialogue yields progress in understanding \u201chorse\u201d and \u201criding.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nBy focusing on the translator, shared experiences, and the alien\u2019s determined but mutual learning, the author spotlights that overcoming language barriers\u2014and learning to interpret each other\u2019s actions\u2014is the critical prerequisite for any further advance. Hence, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other\u201d captures the intended lesson.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforced Irony of Futility, Not Breakthrough  \n  a. \u201cTranslator\u201d leads only to trivial knowledge  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"The Secret Service reports he spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse.\"</quote> After \u201ctranslation,\u201d all Dameri Tass learns or offers is the names of Earth animals and \u201criding\u201d a horse. He never imparts scientific, social, or technological know-how. His final request for a quarantined horse (<quote>\"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet, my name'd be nork.\"</quote>) shows his exchange is purely zoological. If true understanding meant progress, the U.N. would have gained some \u201csuperior\u201d remedy or insight\u2014and they don\u2019t.  \n  b. Wild global anticipation ends in disillusion  \n     \u2022 Despite \u201cthe most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d and nine-tenths of Earth \u201cready and willing to be guided,\u201d the alien\u2019s appearance provokes \u201cmurmuring, questioning, disbelieving\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cA dull roar\u2026 before he was able to quiet the cheering.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This mass disappointment underscores that linguistic comprehension alone does not translate into meaningful solutions.  \n  c. Rejection of deus ex machina  \n     \u2022 Andersen\u2019s plea, \u201cOur world is in chaos\u2026 Perhaps\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ceven though by mistake\u2026 can\u2019t you give us\u2026 some brief word?\u201d</invalid_quote>) is rebuffed. The alien flees, declaring Earth unfit for Galactic League membership (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn't yet\u2026 still have wars\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), confirming humanity\u2019s dependence on itself.  \n\n2. Translation Alone Yields No Guidance  \n  a. Persistent misunderstanding of core concepts  \n     \u2022 The alien must \u201cexperiment\u201d to grasp \u201chorse\u201d (<quote>they pullin' my leg when they said you were after ridin' on the back of those things?\"</quote>). If translation sufficed, he would have known fundamental human practices in six days. His ignorance highlights that language is only one barrier; vast cultural and technological gaps remain.  \n  b. Lack of reciprocal learning  \n     \u2022 Humans never adopt Carthisian methods; they never learn anything \u201calien.\u201d Army quarantines, \u201cno newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (<quote>\"No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.\"</quote>) demonstrate distrust. The failure of mutual exchange shows that overcoming language isn\u2019t enough without shared frameworks or willingness to integrate unknown knowledge.  \n\n3. Satirical Tone Mocks Expectation of Saviors  \n  a. \u201cShaggy dog\u201d humor from patrolmen onward  \n     \u2022 The patrolmen first think it\u2019s \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>\"crash of a new type of Air Force plane\"</quote>) then ridicule him. This ongoing comedy of errors satirizes human gullibility in expecting instant solutions from \u201cadvanced\u201d visitors.  \n  b. Alien\u2019s brogue and antics undercut authority  \n     \u2022 The use of \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d (<quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>) and obsession with earthly pets reduce him to a trivial tourist, not a sage.  \n\n4. Critique of \u201cUniversal Understanding\u201d Thesis  \n  a. No actionable content emerges  \n     \u2022 Debater_B claims shared language leads to progress, yet the story records zero beneficial exchange\u2014only the alien\u2019s departure. The true \u201cmessage\u201d is that miscommunication persists and language parity does not guarantee substantive solutions.  \n  b. Alien never invited to teach or stay  \n     \u2022 Human authorities \u201cdetained\u201d him, then \u201churried him back\u201d (<quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>). Their impatience and refusal to integrate his presence contradict the idea of collaborative learning; they seek answers he cannot provide.  \n  c. Departure driven by alien\u2019s own disinterest  \n     \u2022 He leaves because Earth is \u201cbenighted,\u201d not because he has \u201clessons\u201d to share. His exit, still muttering at the \u201cshaggy horse,\u201d underscores primitive limitations, not enlightenment.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The narrative structure\u2014from anticipated envoy to disappointed crowd\u2014ironically teaches that awaiting cosmic saviors is futile.  \n  \u2022 The alien\u2019s trivial exchanges, his derision of human systems, and his withdrawal reveal that humanity must look inward for solutions.  \n  \u2022 Therefore, the author\u2019s lesson is that \u201csolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space.\u201d Learning to speak one another\u2019s language is necessary but insufficient absent substance, shared frameworks, and human initiative.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s central lesson is the power\u2014and necessity\u2014of bridging linguistic and cultural divides through mutual understanding, not passively expecting or rejecting facile alien solutions. Only by learning one another\u2019s \u201chorse,\u201d we lay groundwork for any meaningful exchange.  \n\n2. The Kerit Helmet Illustrates Universality of Meaning, Not Futility  \n   a. Instant Comprehension Spurs Curiosity  \n      \u2022  \u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026twirled two dials and put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to Larry Dermott\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d <invalid_quote>No wheels, no propeller\u2026with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin.</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022  Instant translation is portrayed as breakthrough, not dead end. Sleepless days pass only before he wears it; communication only begins once both speak. This is the author extolling technology as a tool for understanding, not a joke.  \n\n   b. Shared Experiments Yield New Knowledge  \n      \u2022  Neither knows \u201chorse\u201d until they point and describe, test riding and draw conclusions. <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd jist what is a horse, if I may be so bold as to be askin\u2019?\u201d \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s an animal you ride on.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSure, an\u2019 \u2018twill hurt him not at all.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022  Their finally synchronized concept of riding is celebrated: \u201cJist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg\u2026you climb upon the creature\u2019s back?\u201d <quote>If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet,</quote> The alien longs for horses to \u201cbring back,\u201d confirming successful mutual understanding.  \n\n3. Nonverbal Cues and Shared Experience Precede Words  \n   a. Affection for Animals Communicates Benevolence  \n      \u2022  \u201cHe spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse.\u201d <quote> insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.</quote>  \n      \u2022  Without uttering a word, his gentle handling convinces humans he poses no threat. Only then do they confer courtesy in UN and White House. This dramatizes how nonverbal signals can forge trust before formal discourse.  \n\n   b. Gestures Overcome Language Gaps at Key Moments  \n      \u2022  Patrolmen \u201chumor\u201d him to keep him talking, not to trap him. Mutual experiments in offering cap and observing reactions are cooperative.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFutility\u201d Thesis Misreads the Climax  \n   a. Departure Does Not Undermine Communication Lesson  \n      \u2022  He leaves only after satisfying his zoological aims and learning Earth\u2019s customs. <invalid_quote>\u201cI must blast off immediately\u2026If I'd taken a creature\u2026my name'd be nork.\u201d</invalid_quote> Departure implies mission success in specimen-collection terms, not communication failure.  \n      \u2022  His \u201clonging expression\u201d at the horse shows triumph: he will now return home with knowledge he lacked at start. That is the payoff of transcending language barriers.  \n\n   b. Lack of Prescriptive Advice Stems from His Role as \u201cCollector,\u201d Not Incompetence  \n      \u2022  He self-identifies as \u201csecond-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo,\u201d <quote> meself only a second-rate  collector </quote> so he never intended to deliver social or religious solutions.  \n      \u2022  Humans\u2019 assumption that he should advise reflects their own misinterpretation, not his failure to communicate. The lesson: misaligned expectations must be corrected through genuine dialogue.  \n\n5. Author\u2019s Satire Targets Prejudice, Not Communication Per Se  \n   a. Patrolmen Initial \u201cIrish Brogue\u201d Bias  \n      \u2022  They despise his accent until the translator shows essential words can be parsed. Their shift from hostility to curiosity underscores the moral: with effort, we can transcend dialects.  \n   b. Global Panic Evaporates When UN Finally Listens  \n      \u2022  The U.N. \u201ccracked the iron curtain\u201d only when public insisted; the story shows that inclusive dialogue demands engagement, not isolation.  \n\n6. The Genuine Benefit of Cross-Cultural Dialogue  \n   a. Without speaking \u201csame language\u201d initially, no one would even learn of the horse; they\u2019d shoot him as a \u201ccrash.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if it\u2019s one of ours\u2026cleared his throat\u2026and said 'Glork.' They gaped.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Dialogue transforms threat into curiosity. Only by \u201cunderstanding each other\u201d through combined verbal and nonverbal means can even basic zoological knowledge\u2014and eventual cooperation\u2014emerge.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe narrative arc\u2014from suspicion to translation to mutual learning and eventual farewell\u2014demonstrates that learning to communicate across divides is itself the principal objective and reward. The author shows that understanding need not await cultural homogeneity. Hence, the lesson is that we need not speak the same language to understand each other; once mutual comprehension is achieved, all further possibilities\u2014including cooperation and genuine exchange\u2014become feasible.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
