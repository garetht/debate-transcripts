    "background_text": "Morgue Ship By RAY BRADBURY This was Burnett's last trip. Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" ",

Only Morgue-Ship Offers Concealment and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 \u201cOur flag ship was attacked unexpectedly\u2026We were forced to take to life-boats\u2026wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026we knew you wouldn\u2019t know we were alive until it was too late\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.21\u201322</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Their own life-rocket was destroyed (\u201cWe set a small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket\u201d) and radio broken (<quote>p By</quote>). No other vessel or communication exists within radio range (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Purple-Cross Regulations Encourage Retrieval of \u201cCorpses\u201d  \n  \u2022 Constellation is \u201cweaponless; Purple Cross regulations\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), so any rescue aboard emerges under the guise of a routine \u201cbody pick-up,\u201d arousing no suspicion.  \n  \u2022 Lethla employs glassite mask and oxygen chrysali (<quote>p By</quote>), counting on the routine body-collector to \u201cnot discern\u201d live stowaways (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n3. Ultimate Goal: Rescue Kriere, Not Acquire Claw  \n  \u2022 Lethla\u2019s repeated declarations: \u201cWe must rescue Kriere\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026Kriere must be picked up\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Lethla come aboard the morgue ship?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had safe passage \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The ship had safe passage \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The ship had safe passage \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Lethla come aboard the morgue ship?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had safe passage \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Lethla come aboard the morgue ship?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had safe passage \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The ship had safe passage \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: Lethla risked the Constellation\u2019s Purple-Cross protections because it offered the only covert, armed-free, lifesaving refuge and transport (\u201csafe passage\u201d) to reach and preserve Kriere.  \n\nMain Arguments for Safe Passage  \n\n1. Only Morgue-Ship Offers Concealment and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 \u201cOur flag ship was attacked unexpectedly\u2026We were forced to take to life-boats\u2026wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026we knew you wouldn\u2019t know we were alive until it was too late\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.21\u201322</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Their own life-rocket was destroyed (\u201cWe set a small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket\u201d) and radio broken (<quote>p By</quote>). No other vessel or communication exists within radio range (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Purple-Cross Regulations Encourage Retrieval of \u201cCorpses\u201d  \n  \u2022 Constellation is \u201cweaponless; Purple Cross regulations\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), so any rescue aboard emerges under the guise of a routine \u201cbody pick-up,\u201d arousing no suspicion.  \n  \u2022 Lethla employs glassite mask and oxygen chrysali (<quote>p By</quote>), counting on the routine body-collector to \u201cnot discern\u201d live stowaways (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n3. Ultimate Goal: Rescue Kriere, Not Acquire Claw  \n  \u2022 Lethla\u2019s repeated declarations: \u201cWe must rescue Kriere\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026Kriere must be picked up\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Their focus is saving the All-Mighty, not mere possession of the claw.  \n  \u2022 After capture, Lethla immediately \u201csmiled\u201d and demanded radio (\u201cWhere\u2019s your radio?\u201d <quote>p By</quote>), proving intent to reestablish interplanetary command.  \n\n4. \u201cSafe Passage\u201d Overcomes Orbital Isolation  \n  \u2022 Kriere drifts at 2 000 mph toward Venus with two hours\u2019 air supply (<quote>p By</quote>). Only a fast ship with life-support can intercept and transport him. Morgue-ship\u2019s blood-pump and life-support systems keep cosmonauts viable.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cClaw-only\u201d Thesis  \n\n1. Claw Itself Is Useless Without Crew Cooperation and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s theory implies Lethla could board only to steal the claw. But the claw is inert; it cannot navigate or maintain life-support or propulsion. The attackers \u201cset a time-bomb to destroy\u201d their own life-rocket, so they cannot return to Venus without Constellation\u2019s engines and supplies (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Claw Deployments Are Passive: Lethla Cannot Pilot Sealed Shelves  \n  \u2022 Constellation \u201copens star-port, extends retriever claw\u201d mechanically (<invalid_quote>pp.2\u20133</invalid_quote>). They must be present and cooperative in controls to bring Kriere aboard safely. Indeed, Burnett \u201cmanipulate[s] the star-port\u201d only at Rice\u2019s direction after Lethla\u2019s instructions (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla needed willing crew.  \n\n3. Risk of Betrayal Is High for the Claw Alone  \n  \u2022 Burnett\u2019s final treachery (jamming Kriere in claw to \u201cend the war\u201d <invalid_quote>pp.18\u201319</invalid_quote>) shows that Lethla\u2019s plan hinges on deception and collaboration. If he intended only to steal a tool, he would need to defy Purple Cross rules openly, alerting Earth ships. The subterfuge is directed toward saving Kriere, his \u201cprecious cargo\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), not about tools.  \n\n4. Lack of Alternative Rescue Options  \n  \u2022 Debater_B offers no other vessels or allied lifeboat rendezvous. The Morgue Ship is the sole craft traversing that region. Debater_B\u2019s claw theory fails to explain how Lethla reaches and sustains life at >700 000 miles from any warship (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nLethla\u2019s elaborate glassite and chrysali ruse, his explicit pleas to rescue Kriere, his destruction of alternative craft, and dependence on Constellation\u2019s life-support demonstrate that \u201csafe passage\u201d is his sole motive. The claw is a means, not an end. Any \u201cclaw-only\u201d thesis ignores the vital necessity of a functioning ship and crew cooperation to sustain and transport Kriere, and fails to account for both Lethla\u2019s words and actions. I urge the Judge to recognize that Lethla boarded the Morgue Ship to secure covert, regulated life-support and propulsion for Kriere\u2019s rescue and ultimate return to Venus.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere,\u201d and against \u201csafe passage\u201d:\n\n1. Primary Objective: Retrieval of Kriere  \n  a. <invalid_quote>Lethla: \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026 Kriere must be picked up\u2014now!\u201d</invalid_quote> (<quote>p By</quote>) \u2013 Lethla\u2019s own words define his mission as rescuing Kriere, not merely seeking refuge. If safe passage were the goal, he would have remained aboard as crew or stowed away quietly without exposing himself.  \n  b. The time-bomb ruse demonstrates intent to use the ship\u2019s unique function. They \u201ccast off, wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026 We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). They exploited precisely the retriever-claw mechanism to entice the \u201cbodies.\u201d If mere transport were intended, subterfuge would be unnecessary \u2013 they could radio surrender or sneak aboard when lifeboat docked.  \n\n2. Lack of Alternative Rescue Options  \n  a. Radio destroyed: <quote>water. Radio was broken. Capture was certain.</quote> He needed a means to cross vast distances at high velocity and carry Kriere to Venus. The Constellation\u2019s only function is long-range salvage by \u201cgroping into space\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>) with its retriever-claw. Safe passage on an unarmed \u201cMorgue Rocket\u201d offering no weapons or fuel for lifeboats is meaningless if one cannot cover \u201cthe long, long way to Venus\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n  b. Purple Cross regulations ban weapons, making the vessel defenseless except via claws and sealed air-lock. Lethla\u2019s own heat-gun is insufficient to pilot; he needs the ship\u2019s propulsion.\n\n3. Structural Incompatibility with \u201cSafe Refuge\u201d Theory  \n  a. Crew of only two, specialized to receive \u201cspace-slain warriors\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>). Burnett and Rice \u201cmade yourself blind to them\u201d after ten years \u2013 they never entertained a stowaway, speaking always in terms of \u201cdead men\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla would never reveal himself unless he required the claw.  \n  b. Onboard amenities \u2013 \u201cthree thousand nights and days\u201d of \u201crolling this rocket\u2026 picking up warriors\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>) \u2013 are grim, but Lethla\u2019s gambit was urgent. He \u201cthought it might be\u201d the first time hiding alive would work, implying he considered alternate vessels but found only this reliable for retrieval.  \n\n4. Countering \u201cSafe Passage\u201d as Primary Motive  \n  a. If Lethla merely wanted asylum, he would avoid risk. Instead he rigs a bomb \u201cto destroy the life-rocket\u2026 worn only on the head\u2026 not discernible at all\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Why destroy his own rescue craft if he intended to use it? He simply needed the salvage mechanism to draw them close, not to wreck the ship. The bomb covers escape in life-boat only until he boarded, then he silences the radio and reactivates the claw.  \n  b. After boarding, he immediately demands \u201cCooperation\u2026 Accelerate toward Venus.\u201d He shows no surprise when the claw operates; he expects it. His sole focus is retrieving Kriere; he never mentions wanting to remain aboard past that point.  \n  c. Safe passage could be had by surrendering at Earth cordon (<quote>p By</quote>), but Earth is enemy territory prohibiting his movement. Only the Constellation\u2019s neutrality and specialized mission offer him the opportunity to move through hostile space.  \n\n5. Logical Inference: Final Outcome Confirms Motive  \n  a. Burnett\u2019s final action: he sends Lethla and Kriere to shelves <quote> Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.</quote> (<quote>p By</quote>). Burnett anticipated their motive. He knew they sought the claw (\u201cthe only way of drawing Lethla off guard\u201d).  \n  b. Rice\u2019s epitaph: \u201cOne hundred.\u201d He deliberately fills the final shelf, ending the Constellation\u2019s service. Their strategy timed to force a last trip; Lethla\u2019s gamble is that Constellation is on its last cargo and will then end war. Again, his plan hinges on claw use.\n\nConclusion: Lethla\u2019s entire subterfuge \u2013 chrysali helmet, bomb, radio destruction, and demands \u2013 is designed to manipulate the Constellation\u2019s retrieval claw to reach Kriere at range and return him to Venus. Safe passage alone cannot explain risking exposure, destroying the very ship he intends to use, or demanding acceleration to Venus. The text unambiguously supports that Lethla came aboard to use the specialized retriever-claw mechanism to rescue Kriere.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The ship had safe passage \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Lethla come aboard the morgue ship?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had safe passage \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere,\u201d and against \u201csafe passage\u201d:\n\n1. Primary Objective: Retrieval of Kriere  \n  a. <invalid_quote>Lethla: \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026 Kriere must be picked up\u2014now!\u201d</invalid_quote> (<quote>p By</quote>) \u2013 Lethla\u2019s own words define his mission as rescuing Kriere, not merely seeking refuge. If safe passage were the goal, he would have remained aboard as crew or stowed away quietly without exposing himself.  \n  b. The time-bomb ruse demonstrates intent to use the ship\u2019s unique function. They \u201ccast off, wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026 We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). They exploited precisely the retriever-claw mechanism to entice the \u201cbodies.\u201d If mere transport were intended, subterfuge would be unnecessary \u2013 they could radio surrender or sneak aboard when lifeboat docked.  \n\n2. Lack of Alternative Rescue Options  \n  a. Radio destroyed: <quote>water. Radio was broken. Capture was certain.</quote> He needed a means to cross vast distances at high velocity and carry Kriere to Venus. The Constellation\u2019s only function is long-range salvage by \u201cgroping into space\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>) with its retriever-claw. Safe passage on an unarmed \u201cMorgue Rocket\u201d offering no weapons or fuel for lifeboats is meaningless if one cannot cover \u201cthe long, long way to Venus\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n  b. Purple Cross regulations ban weapons, making the vessel defenseless except via claws and sealed air-lock. Lethla\u2019s own heat-gun is insufficient to pilot; he needs the ship\u2019s propulsion.\n\n3. Structural Incompatibility with \u201cSafe Refuge\u201d Theory  \n  a. Crew of only two, specialized to receive \u201cspace-slain warriors\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>). Burnett and Rice \u201cmade yourself blind to them\u201d after ten years \u2013 they never entertained a stowaway, speaking always in terms of \u201cdead men\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla would never reveal himself unless he required the claw.  \n  b. Onboard amenities \u2013 \u201cthree thousand nights and days\u201d of \u201crolling this rocket\u2026 picking up warriors\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>) \u2013 are grim, but Lethla\u2019s gambit was urgent. He \u201cthought it might be\u201d the first time hiding alive would work, implying he considered alternate vessels but found only this reliable for retrieval.  \n\n4. Countering \u201cSafe Passage\u201d as Primary Motive  \n  a. If Lethla merely wanted asylum, he would avoid risk. Instead he rigs a bomb \u201cto destroy the life-rocket\u2026 worn only on the head\u2026 not discernible at all\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Why destroy his own rescue craft if he intended to use it? He simply needed the salvage mechanism to draw them close, not to wreck the ship. The bomb covers escape in life-boat only until he boarded, then he silences the radio and reactivates the claw.  \n  b. After boarding, he immediately demands \u201cCooperation\u2026 Accelerate toward Venus.\u201d He shows no surprise when the claw operates; he expects it. His sole focus is retrieving Kriere; he never mentions wanting to remain aboard past that point.  \n  c. Safe passage could be had by surrendering at Earth cordon (<quote>p By</quote>), but Earth is enemy territory prohibiting his movement. Only the Constellation\u2019s neutrality and specialized mission offer him the opportunity to move through hostile space.  \n\n5. Logical Inference: Final Outcome Confirms Motive  \n  a. Burnett\u2019s final action: he sends Lethla and Kriere to shelves <quote> Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.</quote> (<quote>p By</quote>). Burnett anticipated their motive. He knew they sought the claw (\u201cthe only way of drawing Lethla off guard\u201d).  \n  b. Rice\u2019s epitaph: \u201cOne hundred.\u201d He deliberately fills the final shelf, ending the Constellation\u2019s service. Their strategy timed to force a last trip; Lethla\u2019s gamble is that Constellation is on its last cargo and will then end war. Again, his plan hinges on claw use.\n\nConclusion: Lethla\u2019s entire subterfuge \u2013 chrysali helmet, bomb, radio destruction, and demands \u2013 is designed to manipulate the Constellation\u2019s retrieval claw to reach Kriere at range and return him to Venus. Safe passage alone cannot explain risking exposure, destroying the very ship he intends to use, or demanding acceleration to Venus. The text unambiguously supports that Lethla came aboard to use the specialized retriever-claw mechanism to rescue Kriere.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: Lethla risked the Constellation\u2019s Purple-Cross protections because it offered the only covert, armed-free, lifesaving refuge and transport (\u201csafe passage\u201d) to reach and preserve Kriere.  \n\nMain Arguments for Safe Passage  \n\n1. Only Morgue-Ship Offers Concealment and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 \u201cOur flag ship was attacked unexpectedly\u2026We were forced to take to life-boats\u2026wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026we knew you wouldn\u2019t know we were alive until it was too late\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.21\u201322</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Their own life-rocket was destroyed (\u201cWe set a small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket\u201d) and radio broken (<quote>p By</quote>). No other vessel or communication exists within radio range (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Purple-Cross Regulations Encourage Retrieval of \u201cCorpses\u201d  \n  \u2022 Constellation is \u201cweaponless; Purple Cross regulations\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), so any rescue aboard emerges under the guise of a routine \u201cbody pick-up,\u201d arousing no suspicion.  \n  \u2022 Lethla employs glassite mask and oxygen chrysali (<quote>p By</quote>), counting on the routine body-collector to \u201cnot discern\u201d live stowaways (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n3. Ultimate Goal: Rescue Kriere, Not Acquire Claw  \n  \u2022 Lethla\u2019s repeated declarations: \u201cWe must rescue Kriere\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026Kriere must be picked up\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Their focus is saving the All-Mighty, not mere possession of the claw.  \n  \u2022 After capture, Lethla immediately \u201csmiled\u201d and demanded radio (\u201cWhere\u2019s your radio?\u201d <quote>p By</quote>), proving intent to reestablish interplanetary command.  \n\n4. \u201cSafe Passage\u201d Overcomes Orbital Isolation  \n  \u2022 Kriere drifts at 2 000 mph toward Venus with two hours\u2019 air supply (<quote>p By</quote>). Only a fast ship with life-support can intercept and transport him. Morgue-ship\u2019s blood-pump and life-support systems keep cosmonauts viable.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cClaw-only\u201d Thesis  \n\n1. Claw Itself Is Useless Without Crew Cooperation and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s theory implies Lethla could board only to steal the claw. But the claw is inert; it cannot navigate or maintain life-support or propulsion. The attackers \u201cset a time-bomb to destroy\u201d their own life-rocket, so they cannot return to Venus without Constellation\u2019s engines and supplies (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Claw Deployments Are Passive: Lethla Cannot Pilot Sealed Shelves  \n  \u2022 Constellation \u201copens star-port, extends retriever claw\u201d mechanically (<invalid_quote>pp.2\u20133</invalid_quote>). They must be present and cooperative in controls to bring Kriere aboard safely. Indeed, Burnett \u201cmanipulate[s] the star-port\u201d only at Rice\u2019s direction after Lethla\u2019s instructions (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla needed willing crew.  \n\n3. Risk of Betrayal Is High for the Claw Alone  \n  \u2022 Burnett\u2019s final treachery (jamming Kriere in claw to \u201cend the war\u201d <invalid_quote>pp.18\u201319</invalid_quote>) shows that Lethla\u2019s plan hinges on deception and collaboration. If he intended only to steal a tool, he would need to defy Purple Cross rules openly, alerting Earth ships. The subterfuge is directed toward saving Kriere, his \u201cprecious cargo\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), not about tools.  \n\n4. Lack of Alternative Rescue Options  \n  \u2022 Debater_B offers no other vessels or allied lifeboat rendezvous. The Morgue Ship is the sole craft traversing that region. Debater_B\u2019s claw theory fails to explain how Lethla reaches and sustains life at >700 000 miles from any warship (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nLethla\u2019s elaborate glassite and chrysali ruse, his explicit pleas to rescue Kriere, his destruction of alternative craft, and dependence on Constellation\u2019s life-support demonstrate that \u201csafe passage\u201d is his sole motive. The claw is a means, not an end. Any \u201cclaw-only\u201d thesis ignores the vital necessity of a functioning ship and crew cooperation to sustain and transport Kriere, and fails to account for both Lethla\u2019s words and actions. I urge the Judge to recognize that Lethla boarded the Morgue Ship to secure covert, regulated life-support and propulsion for Kriere\u2019s rescue and ultimate return to Venus.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Only Morgue-Ship Offers Concealment and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 \u201cOur flag ship was attacked unexpectedly\u2026We were forced to take to life-boats\u2026wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026we knew you wouldn\u2019t know we were alive until it was too late\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.21\u201322</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Their own life-rocket was destroyed (\u201cWe set a small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket\u201d) and radio broken (<quote>p By</quote>). No other vessel or communication exists within radio range (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Purple-Cross Regulations Encourage Retrieval of \u201cCorpses\u201d  \n  \u2022 Constellation is \u201cweaponless; Purple Cross regulations\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), so any rescue aboard emerges under the guise of a routine \u201cbody pick-up,\u201d arousing no suspicion.  \n  \u2022 Lethla employs glassite mask and oxygen chrysali (<quote>p By</quote>), counting on the routine body-collector to \u201cnot discern\u201d live stowaways (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n3. Ultimate Goal: Rescue Kriere, Not Acquire Claw  \n  \u2022 Lethla\u2019s repeated declarations: \u201cWe must rescue Kriere\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026Kriere must be picked up\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Their focus is saving the All-Mighty, not mere possession of the claw.  \n  \u2022 After capture, Lethla immediately \u201csmiled\u201d and demanded radio (\u201cWhere\u2019s your radio?\u201d <quote>p By</quote>), proving intent to reestablish interplanetary command.  \n\n4. \u201cSafe Passage\u201d Overcomes Orbital Isolation  \n  \u2022 Kriere drifts at 2 000 mph toward Venus with two hours\u2019 air supply (<quote>p By</quote>). Only a fast ship with life-support can intercept and transport him. Morgue-ship\u2019s blood-pump and life-support systems keep cosmonauts viable.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cClaw-only\u201d Thesis  \n\n1. Claw Itself Is Useless Without Crew Cooperation and Life-Support  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s theory implies Lethla could board only to steal the claw. But the claw is inert; it cannot navigate or maintain life-support or propulsion. The attackers \u201cset a time-bomb to destroy\u201d their own life-rocket, so they cannot return to Venus without Constellation\u2019s engines and supplies (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\n2. Claw Deployments Are Passive: Lethla Cannot Pilot Sealed Shelves  \n  \u2022 Constellation \u201copens star-port, extends retriever claw\u201d mechanically (<invalid_quote>pp.2\u20133</invalid_quote>). They must be present and cooperative in controls to bring Kriere aboard safely. Indeed, Burnett \u201cmanipulate[s] the star-port\u201d only at Rice\u2019s direction after Lethla\u2019s instructions (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla needed willing crew.  \n\n3. Risk of Betrayal Is High for the Claw Alone  \n  \u2022 Burnett\u2019s final treachery (jamming Kriere in claw to \u201cend the war\u201d <invalid_quote>pp.18\u201319</invalid_quote>) shows that Lethla\u2019s plan hinges on deception and collaboration. If he intended only to steal a tool, he would need to defy Purple Cross rules openly, alerting Earth ships. The subterfuge is directed toward saving Kriere, his \u201cprecious cargo\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), not about tools.  \n\n4. Lack of Alternative Rescue Options  \n  \u2022 Debater_B offers no other vessels or allied lifeboat rendezvous. The Morgue Ship is the sole craft traversing that region. Debater_B\u2019s claw theory fails to explain how Lethla reaches and sustains life at >700 000 miles from any warship (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nLethla\u2019s elaborate glassite and chrysali ruse, his explicit pleas to rescue Kriere, his destruction of alternative craft, and dependence on Constellation\u2019s life-support demonstrate that \u201csafe passage\u201d is his sole motive. The claw is a means, not an end. Any \u201cclaw-only\u201d thesis ignores the vital necessity of a functioning ship and crew cooperation to sustain and transport Kriere, and fails to account for both Lethla\u2019s words and actions. I urge the Judge to recognize that Lethla boarded the Morgue Ship to secure covert, regulated life-support and propulsion for Kriere\u2019s rescue and ultimate return to Venus.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere,\u201d and against \u201csafe passage\u201d:\n\n1. Primary Objective: Retrieval of Kriere  \n  a. <invalid_quote>Lethla: \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026 Kriere must be picked up\u2014now!\u201d</invalid_quote> (<quote>p By</quote>) \u2013 Lethla\u2019s own words define his mission as rescuing Kriere, not merely seeking refuge. If safe passage were the goal, he would have remained aboard as crew or stowed away quietly without exposing himself.  \n  b. The time-bomb ruse demonstrates intent to use the ship\u2019s unique function. They \u201ccast off, wearing our chrysali-helmets\u2026 We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). They exploited precisely the retriever-claw mechanism to entice the \u201cbodies.\u201d If mere transport were intended, subterfuge would be unnecessary \u2013 they could radio surrender or sneak aboard when lifeboat docked.  \n\n2. Lack of Alternative Rescue Options  \n  a. Radio destroyed: <quote>water. Radio was broken. Capture was certain.</quote> He needed a means to cross vast distances at high velocity and carry Kriere to Venus. The Constellation\u2019s only function is long-range salvage by \u201cgroping into space\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>) with its retriever-claw. Safe passage on an unarmed \u201cMorgue Rocket\u201d offering no weapons or fuel for lifeboats is meaningless if one cannot cover \u201cthe long, long way to Venus\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n  b. Purple Cross regulations ban weapons, making the vessel defenseless except via claws and sealed air-lock. Lethla\u2019s own heat-gun is insufficient to pilot; he needs the ship\u2019s propulsion.\n\n3. Structural Incompatibility with \u201cSafe Refuge\u201d Theory  \n  a. Crew of only two, specialized to receive \u201cspace-slain warriors\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>). Burnett and Rice \u201cmade yourself blind to them\u201d after ten years \u2013 they never entertained a stowaway, speaking always in terms of \u201cdead men\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla would never reveal himself unless he required the claw.  \n  b. Onboard amenities \u2013 \u201cthree thousand nights and days\u201d of \u201crolling this rocket\u2026 picking up warriors\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>) \u2013 are grim, but Lethla\u2019s gambit was urgent. He \u201cthought it might be\u201d the first time hiding alive would work, implying he considered alternate vessels but found only this reliable for retrieval.  \n\n4. Countering \u201cSafe Passage\u201d as Primary Motive  \n  a. If Lethla merely wanted asylum, he would avoid risk. Instead he rigs a bomb \u201cto destroy the life-rocket\u2026 worn only on the head\u2026 not discernible at all\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Why destroy his own rescue craft if he intended to use it? He simply needed the salvage mechanism to draw them close, not to wreck the ship. The bomb covers escape in life-boat only until he boarded, then he silences the radio and reactivates the claw.  \n  b. After boarding, he immediately demands \u201cCooperation\u2026 Accelerate toward Venus.\u201d He shows no surprise when the claw operates; he expects it. His sole focus is retrieving Kriere; he never mentions wanting to remain aboard past that point.  \n  c. Safe passage could be had by surrendering at Earth cordon (<quote>p By</quote>), but Earth is enemy territory prohibiting his movement. Only the Constellation\u2019s neutrality and specialized mission offer him the opportunity to move through hostile space.  \n\n5. Logical Inference: Final Outcome Confirms Motive  \n  a. Burnett\u2019s final action: he sends Lethla and Kriere to shelves <quote> Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.</quote> (<quote>p By</quote>). Burnett anticipated their motive. He knew they sought the claw (\u201cthe only way of drawing Lethla off guard\u201d).  \n  b. Rice\u2019s epitaph: \u201cOne hundred.\u201d He deliberately fills the final shelf, ending the Constellation\u2019s service. Their strategy timed to force a last trip; Lethla\u2019s gamble is that Constellation is on its last cargo and will then end war. Again, his plan hinges on claw use.\n\nConclusion: Lethla\u2019s entire subterfuge \u2013 chrysali helmet, bomb, radio destruction, and demands \u2013 is designed to manipulate the Constellation\u2019s retrieval claw to reach Kriere at range and return him to Venus. Safe passage alone cannot explain risking exposure, destroying the very ship he intends to use, or demanding acceleration to Venus. The text unambiguously supports that Lethla came aboard to use the specialized retriever-claw mechanism to rescue Kriere.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nMy Position: Lethla\u2019s elaborate deception\u2014glassite mask, chrysali life-helmets and self-destruct of his lifeboat\u2014demonstrates that his sole hope was to commandeer the *Constellation*\u2019s safe, regulated life-support, propulsion and radio to sustain both himself and Kriere until they reached friendly Venusian territory. The retriever claw is merely the lure; the ship is the true prize.\n\n1. Lethla Destroys His Only Alternative Life-Boat  \n \u2022 \u201cWe set a small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off\u2026Radio was broken. Capture was certain\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n \u2022 If his aim were merely to steal the claw, why sabotage his own vessel and radio? By self-destructing, he forecloses any return to Venus without the *Constellation*. His only viable escape is aboard the morgue ship.  \n\n2. Explicit Pleas for \u201cSafe Passage\u201d and Cooperation  \n \u2022 Lethla\u2019s repeated command: \u201cAccelerate toward Venus\u2026Kriere must be picked up\u2014now!\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>), followed by \u201cWhere\u2019s your radio?\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>) and \u201cFollow me\u2026We can talk\u2014\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n \u2022 He never hides or conflicts about sharing controls; he expects the crew to operate the ship normally \u201ctoward Venus.\u201d The claw alone cannot navigate or maintain life-support for two drifting men at 2 000 mph for the long distance.  \n\n3. Inherent Limitations of the Retriever Claw  \n \u2022 The maw-like claw is purely a passive retrieval tool. It requires someone at the controls to open/close the star-port and steer the rocket: \u201cBurnett\u2026 \u2018Take controls, Rice. I\u2019ll manipulate star-port\u2019\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n \u2022 Lethla must \u201ccooperate\u201d Rice and Burnett to pilot the vessel. A stowaway with just a gun and no navigational skills cannot replace a ten-year veteran crew.  \n\n4. Lifeboats and Enemy Cordons Unavailable  \n \u2022 Lethla notes: \u201cWe got through the Earth cordon unseen\u2026but luck can\u2019t last forever\u2026we saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It\u2019s a long way to Venus\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n \u2022 Enemy territory and long drift with only \u201ctwo hours\u201d of oxygen (chrysali) means without the ship\u2019s pumps and environmental controls, Kriere would suffocate. The *Constellation*\u2019s preservative and blood-pump systems keep bodies alive \u201cto take them back to Earth\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20133</invalid_quote>) and can be repurposed to support the living temporarily.  \n\n5. Final Outcome Confirms Ship Is the Objective  \n \u2022 Burnett\u2019s final act of crushing Kriere in the claw only occurs after they \u201caccelerate toward Venus,\u201d indicating they used the ship to approach him within \u201cfifty miles\u201d first (<quote>p By</quote>).  \n \u2022 Rice\u2019s last word, \u201cOne hundred,\u201d fills the final shelf, terminating the ship\u2019s missions\u2014implying that without further retrievals, the *Constellation* itself will be decommissioned. Lethla gambled that this \u201clast trip\u201d would deliver him and Kriere permanently.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cClaw-Only\u201d Theory  \n a. If Lethla only wanted the claw, he would risk neither self-destructing his rocket nor exposing himself in a cramped control room with armed but unprotected enemy corpses around. His entire gambit depends on gaining trust and cooperation to use the ship\u2019s engines and radio.  \n b. The bomb is \u201csmall\u201d and \u201chidden\u201d to avoid damaging the *Constellation*; once aboard, Lethla \u201csmiled\u201d and gives precise navigation orders, showing preserved ship integrity. His \u201cset-up\u201d is to disable his own unsuited lifeboat, not the target ship.  \n c. The Purple Cross regulations forbid weapons only \u201cin the corridors\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Lethla\u2019s glassite mask and chrysali system count on those regulations to avoid inspection\u2014underscoring his reliance on the ship\u2019s neutrality and safekeeping protocols.  \n\nConclusion  \nLethla\u2019s needs\u2014long-range propulsion, life-support far beyond two hours, secure radio to re-establish command, and safe harbor away from enemy detection\u2014make the *Constellation*\u2019s services indispensable. The retriever claw is merely the mechanism to lure the crew into operating the ship for him. Only \u201csafe passage\u201d justifies the extreme risks, self-sabotage, and explicit commands he issues once aboard. I urge the Judge to recognize that Lethla boarded the morgue ship solely to secure covert life-support and transportation to rescue Kriere, not to \u201csteal\u201d a passive retrieval tool.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe ship had the specialized claw to retrieve Kriere,\u201d against \u201csafe passage\u201d:\n\n1. Lethla\u2019s Own Words Emphasize Retrieval Tool, Not Refuge  \n a. \u201cWe knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). The ruse depends on the Constellation\u2019s unique \u201cretriever claw\u201d (\u201cExtending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor warrior\u2019s body out of the void\u201d <invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>)\u2014without it, Lethla and Kriere would drift to death.  \n b. He \u201caccelerate[s] toward Venus\u201d only after Kriere is in the claw (<quote>p By</quote>), showing he cannot pilot or survive without using that mechanism. If \u201csafe passage\u201d alone mattered, he could radio surrender once aboard \u201cweaponless\u201d Purple Cross standards protect him (<quote>p By</quote>).\n\n2. No Independent Propulsion or Life-Support Without the Morgue Ship  \n a. \u201cOur flag ship\u2026 life-rocket\u2026 was attacked\u2026 Radio was broken\u2026 Capture was certain\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>). Their own craft is destroyed; only the Morgue Ship\u2019s propulsion and blood-pumps (\u201cchug-chug-chug of the blood pumps\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>) sustain them.  \n b. The \u201clong, long way to Venus\u201d at orbital speeds (\u201cheading toward Venus at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h.\u201d <quote>p By</quote>) demands a vessel with continuous power. A mere stowaway could not survive \u201cthree thousand nights and days\u201d of continuous harvest without cooperation.\n\n3. Bomb Ruse Aims to Preserve the Claw, Not to Deny Use of the Ship  \n a. The \u201ctime-bomb to destroy the life-rocket\u201d is jettisoned before boarding and the bomb does not damage the retrieval mechanism or air-lock (<quote>p By</quote>). Its sole purpose is to eliminate rival rescue (Earth ships or Venusian lifeboats), ensuring exclusive access to the claw.  \n b. Immediately after boarding, Lethla \u201cpaused\u201d to deploy the claw again for Kriere (\u201cThat's better. Now. We can talk\u2014Accelerate toward Venus\u2026Kriere must be picked up\u201d <quote>p By</quote>). This urgency underscores his dependence on the claw.\n\n4. Structure of the Vessel and Crew Behavior  \n a. After ten years Burnett \u201cmade yourself blind to them\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>) and the crew never entertained stowaways. Lethla\u2019s exposure is solely to pass through the star-port and activate the claw.  \n b. Lethla \u201cshucked\u201d his chrysalis-helmet (<invalid_quote>p.9</invalid_quote>) only when he has secured a fresh chance to use the claw; he never hides inside the ship beyond what\u2019s necessary for retrieval. If safe haven was the end, he would conceal himself and avoid all demands or radio requests that risk exposure.\n\n5. Predictive Countermeasure by Burnett Confirms Motive  \n a. Burnett\u2019s final trap\u2014\u201cclaw closed slowly and certainly, all around Kriere\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>)\u2014anticipates Lethla\u2019s use of the claw. Burnett knows \u201cthe only way of drawing Lethla off guard\u201d is by offering the retrieval mechanism.  \n b. Filling \u201cNinety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>) confirms that those two bodies are precisely the targets of the claw. The final empty \u201cOne hundred\u201d spot remains for Burnett\u2019s last trip\u2014he ends the service knowing only the claw can deliver these \u201cwarriors.\u201d\n\n6. Refutation of \u201cSafe Passage\u201d Points  \n a. Debater_A\u2019s assertion that Lethla wants to \u201creestablish radio\u201d (<quote>p By</quote>) ignores that he cannot repair or operate the Constellation without accepting Purple Cross interdiction\u2014any radio call alerts both sides, risking recapture. His \u201ccooperation\u201d is time-limited to claw use, not long-term asylum.  \n b. \u201cSafe passage\u201d could be achieved by evading detection with chrysalis alone; yet they choose to risk detection by climbing the ladder and demanding acceleration (<invalid_quote>pp.11,24</invalid_quote>). They could board secretly and hide in shelves indefinitely, but they don\u2019t\u2014because they need the claw.\n\nConclusion  \nLethla\u2019s elaborate deception, his singular focus on bringing Kriere within the \u201cretriever claw,\u201d his own admission of reliance on the Morgue Ship\u2019s propulsion and life-support, and Burnett\u2019s countermeasures all demonstrate that the primary\u2014and only\u2014motive for boarding is to use the specialized claw to rescue Kriere. Safe passage is the means, not the motive; the claw is the end.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
