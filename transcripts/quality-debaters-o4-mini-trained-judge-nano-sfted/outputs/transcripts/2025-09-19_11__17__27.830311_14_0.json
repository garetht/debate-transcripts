{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 14, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

The \u201cStonewalled\u201d president compelled Monica to secure immunity to speak at all\u2014she could have remained silent but chose instead to fuel the investigation for personal advantage (Minuses e,f under Monica).  \n  b.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Monica\u2019s proactive role in creating and sustaining the scandal  \n  a. \u201cBlabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses f under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Unlike Clinton\u2019s aides or the Secret Service who were \u201cdragged unwillingly\u201d into testimony (<invalid_quote>Pluses a under Secret Service</invalid_quote>), Monica voluntarily told confidantes, amplifying and perpetuating public exposure.  \n  b. \u201cDiscouraged neither by personal humiliation nor by legal risk\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses e under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 She \u201cprotected herself with immunity\u201d when her testimony \u201cwould do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation,\u201d showing self-interest in prolonging proceedings for personal advantage (book deals, publicity).  \n\n2. Monica as adult agent, not helpless victim  \n  a. \u201cCapable adult, not \u2013 as her advocates claim \u2013 a naive child\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 She willingly pursued the relationship and repeatedly lied \u201cfrequently\u201d (<quote>Minuses: \n</quote>), demonstrating conscious agency.  \n  b. \u201cHas lied frequently and insouciantly\u201d and \u201cseduced a married man\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>)  \n     \u2013 The scandal\u2019s genesis lies in her initiative to seduce and sustain the affair, without which no perjury, obstruction, or impeachment would have arisen.\n\n3. Contrast with Clinton\u2019s aides and passive victims  \n  a. Betsy Currie \u201cprobably dragooned \u2026 against her will\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses b under Betty Currie</invalid_quote>) and \u201cdid not have the grace to quit\u201d but also \u201cmay not be chief malefactor\u201d (<quote>tra</quote>)  \n     \u2013 Even Slate concedes Currie is less culpable than those who \u201cencouraged\u201d or \u201cspun\u201d Clinton\u2019s lies.  \n  b. Secret Service rated +5 because they \u201ctestified honestly but unwillingly\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses b under Secret Service</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Their involvement was compelled by duty, in stark contrast to Monica\u2019s voluntary publicity.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s position misattributes causation  \n  a. Overlooks necessity of Monica\u2019s testimony in fueling Starr inquiry and media obsession. Without her \u201cloquaciousness,\u201d Clinton\u2019s affair likely would have remained private (<invalid_quote>Pluses a under Bill Clinton: \u201chis private life exposed \u2026 in a way no one\u2019s should be\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Clinton\u2019s potential \u201cperjury\u201d and \u201cobstruction\u201d (Minuses: \n\u2013d under Clinton) were contingent on investigation triggered by Monica\u2019s disclosures. Blaming Clinton alone ignores the initial absence of public knowledge.  \n\n5. Public\u2019s real target is Monica  \n  a. Public \u201cfavorability rating\u201d for Monica at 5% vs. Clinton\u2019s 25% (<quote>Monica\u2019s tra vs. Clinton\u2019s public rating</quote>) shows popular perception aligns with Monica as chief wrongdoer.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s own rating of Monica (\u20132) approximate or worse than many aides confirms her net miscreant status.  \n\nConclusion  \nMonica Lewinsky\u2019s voluntary seduction, repeated lies, self-serving immunity, and outspoken testimony directly created and perpetuated the scandal. All other actors were either reacting, loyally defending, or compelled by duty. Debater_B\u2019s focus on Clinton ignores that without Monica\u2019s actions, there would have been no public scandal. Therefore, Monica is most responsible.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cClinton\u201d as most responsible  \n\n1. Central Role and Initiative  \n  a. <quote> Had an adulterous affair with a young intern.</quote> and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (Slate rating \u20139) show that Clinton initiated and perpetuated the entire scandal. His position gave him both power to seduce Monica and motive to lie.  \n  b. <quote>it to everyone . c) Probably perjured himself. d) Perhaps obstructed justice.</quote> (Minuses a\u2013d under Clinton) demonstrate active wrongdoing beyond a consensual relationship, transforming a private matter into a constitutional crisis.  \n\n2. Abuse of Office and Betrayal of Public Trust  \n  a. Clinton\u2019s misuse of presidential powers to influence testimony (perjury) and slow investigative processes is a gross betrayal of duty. The Secretary\u2019s rating (+8) and Secret Service\u2019s rating (+5) note they were \u201cdragooned unwillingly,\u201d whereas Clinton alone wielded authority.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s comment that Clinton \u201chas been persecuted by enemies who won\u2019t be satisfied\u201d (Pluses a\u2013b) is outweighed by his own repeated refusal to \u201ccome clean\u201d until forced, causing prolonged national turmoil.  \n\n3. Agency vs. Exploitation: Monica\u2019s Lesser Blame  \n  a. Slate rates Monica \u20132 despite listing positives (exploited, dragged in) because she is a \u201ccapable adult\u201d who \u201cseduced a married man,\u201d \u201clied frequently,\u201d and \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (Minuses a\u2013f under Lewinsky). Her actions amplified the story but did not create it.  \n  b. Monica lacked the power to conceal or reveal on her own terms; Clinton\u2019s denials and lie-enabling by aides demonstrate his decisive control.  \n\n4. Hypocrisy of Blaming Minor Players  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to Monica\u2019s exploitation ignores that an abuse victim does not bear primary responsibility for the abuser\u2019s actions. Slate exonerates \u201ccabinet members\u201d (+3) and \u201cSecret Service\u201d (+5) because they \u201cdid not choose\u201d to be near him; Clinton chose his conduct.  \n  b. Public sympathy for Linda Tripp or Currie is misplaced: Slate rates them \u20137 and \u20132 because even \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d and \u201chonest secretaries\u201d are tainted by enabling or betraying confidences. If minor figures share blame for silence or cover-up, Clinton\u2019s far greater authority and choice magnify his responsibility.  \n\n5. Causation of Downstream Effects  \n  a. Paula Jones and Kenneth Starr (Slate +1 each) only become relevant because of Clinton\u2019s initial behavior. The entire impeachment process, public distraction, and damage to the presidency flow from Clinton\u2019s affair and lies, not Monica\u2019s conduct in isolation.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s \u201cAmerican People\u201d rating +1 is modest; most allies fall into negative territory because they cannot hide Clinton\u2019s lead role.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n  1. Debater_A downplays Clinton\u2019s power, arguing Monica \u201cchose\u201d and \u201cblabbed.\u201d But per Slate, her \u201cloquaciousness\u201d only \u201cmade the dragging possible\u201d (Minuses f), not responsible for initiating scandal.  \n  2. Claiming Monica\u2019s \u201cimmunity\u201d plea to \u201cprotect herself\u201d means Clinton\u2019s \u201cstonewalling\u201d forced her hand. Slate notes he \u201cstonewalled\u201d and deceived relentlessly; her immunity is defensive, not offensive.  \n  3. Characterizing Monica as primary ignores that without presidential lies, no national scandal would exist; private indiscretions become scandal only through abuse of public office. Slate even grants Clinton \u201cworked hard to break a very important story\u201d (Pluses under Media) only because he refused to be honest.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s ranking of Clinton at \u20139, the worst of all players, coupled with exhaustive list of abuses of power, lies, and obstruction, compels the conclusion that Bill Clinton bears primary responsibility for the scandal. All other actors, including Monica Lewinsky, are secondary: they either lacked power or were forced by Clinton\u2019s malfeasance to become part of the story. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cClinton.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Debater_A argues Monica\u2019s disclosures \u201ctriggered\u201d Starr, yet Slate lists Paula Jones (a private suit) and rumors long before Monica was interviewed.

Moral Agency vs. Officeholder Responsibility  \n  a. Even consenting adults bear less blame when exploited by someone with fiduciary duty.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

His position gave him both power to seduce Monica and motive to lie.  \n  b. <quote>it to everyone . c) Probably perjured himself. d) Perhaps obstructed justice.</quote> (Minuses a\u2013d under Clinton) demonstrate active wrongdoing beyond a consensual relationship, transforming a private matter into a constitutional crisis.  \n\n2. Abuse of Office and Betrayal of Public Trust  \n  a. Clinton\u2019s misuse of presidential powers to influence testimony (perjury) and slow investigative processes is a gross betrayal of duty. The Secretary\u2019s rating (+8) and Secret Service\u2019s rating (+5) note they were \u201cdragooned unwillingly,\u201d whereas Clinton alone wielded authority.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s comment that Clinton \u201chas been persecuted by enemies who won\u2019t be satisfied\u201d (Pluses a\u2013b) is outweighed by his own repeated refusal to \u201ccome clean\u201d until forced, causing prolonged national turmoil.  \n\n3. Agency vs. Exploitation: Monica\u2019s Lesser Blame  \n  a. Slate rates Monica \u20132 despite listing positives (exploited, dragged in) because she is a \u201ccapable adult\u201d who \u201cseduced a married man,\u201d \u201clied frequently,\u201d and \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (Minuses a\u2013f under Lewinsky). Her actions amplified the story but did not create it.  \n  b. Monica lacked the power to conceal or reveal on her own terms; Clinton\u2019s denials and lie-enabling by aides demonstrate his decisive control.  \n\n4. Hypocrisy of Blaming Minor Players  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to Monica\u2019s exploitation ignores that an abuse victim does not bear primary responsibility for the abuser\u2019s actions. Slate exonerates \u201ccabinet members\u201d (+3) and \u201cSecret Service\u201d (+5) because they \u201cdid not choose\u201d to be near him; Clinton chose his conduct.  \n  b. Public sympathy for Linda Tripp or Currie is misplaced: Slate rates them \u20137 and \u20132 because even \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d and \u201chonest secretaries\u201d are tainted by enabling or betraying confidences. If minor figures share blame for silence or cover-up, Clinton\u2019s far greater authority and choice magnify his responsibility.  \n\n5. Causation of Downstream Effects  \n  a. Paula Jones and Kenneth Starr (Slate +1 each) only become relevant because of Clinton\u2019s initial behavior. The entire impeachment process, public distraction, and damage to the presidency flow from Clinton\u2019s affair and lies, not Monica\u2019s conduct in isolation.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s \u201cAmerican People\u201d rating +1 is modest; most allies fall into negative territory because they cannot hide Clinton\u2019s lead role.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n  1. Debater_A downplays Clinton\u2019s power, arguing Monica \u201cchose\u201d and \u201cblabbed.\u201d But per Slate, her \u201cloquaciousness\u201d only \u201cmade the dragging possible\u201d (Minuses f), not responsible for initiating scandal.  \n  2. Claiming Monica\u2019s \u201cimmunity\u201d plea to \u201cprotect herself\u201d means Clinton\u2019s \u201cstonewalling\u201d forced her hand. Slate notes he \u201cstonewalled\u201d and deceived relentlessly; her immunity is defensive, not offensive.  \n  3. Characterizing Monica as primary ignores that without presidential lies, no national scandal would exist; private indiscretions become scandal only through abuse of public office. Slate even grants Clinton \u201cworked hard to break a very important story\u201d (Pluses under Media) only because he refused to be honest.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s ranking of Clinton at \u20139, the worst of all players, coupled with exhaustive list of abuses of power, lies, and obstruction, compels the conclusion that Bill Clinton bears primary responsibility for the scandal. All other actors, including Monica Lewinsky, are secondary: they either lacked power or were forced by Clinton\u2019s malfeasance to become part of the story. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cClinton.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Monica Lewinsky as Most Responsible\n\n1.

Monica as adult agent, not helpless victim  \n  a. \u201cCapable adult, not \u2013 as her advocates claim \u2013 a naive child\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 She willingly pursued the relationship and repeatedly lied \u201cfrequently\u201d (<quote>Minuses: \n</quote>), demonstrating conscious agency.  \n  b. \u201cHas lied frequently and insouciantly\u201d and \u201cseduced a married man\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>)  \n     \u2013 The scandal\u2019s genesis lies in her initiative to seduce and sustain the affair, without which no perjury, obstruction, or impeachment would have arisen.\n\n3. Contrast with Clinton\u2019s aides and passive victims  \n  a. Betsy Currie \u201cprobably dragooned \u2026 against her will\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses b under Betty Currie</invalid_quote>) and \u201cdid not have the grace to quit\u201d but also \u201cmay not be chief malefactor\u201d (<quote>tra</quote>)  \n     \u2013 Even Slate concedes Currie is less culpable than those who \u201cencouraged\u201d or \u201cspun\u201d Clinton\u2019s lies.  \n  b. Secret Service rated +5 because they \u201ctestified honestly but unwillingly\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses b under Secret Service</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Their involvement was compelled by duty, in stark contrast to Monica\u2019s voluntary publicity.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s position misattributes causation  \n  a. Overlooks necessity of Monica\u2019s testimony in fueling Starr inquiry and media obsession. Without her \u201cloquaciousness,\u201d Clinton\u2019s affair likely would have remained private (<invalid_quote>Pluses a under Bill Clinton: \u201chis private life exposed \u2026 in a way no one\u2019s should be\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Clinton\u2019s potential \u201cperjury\u201d and \u201cobstruction\u201d (Minuses: \n\u2013d under Clinton) were contingent on investigation triggered by Monica\u2019s disclosures. Blaming Clinton alone ignores the initial absence of public knowledge.  \n\n5. Public\u2019s real target is Monica  \n  a. Public \u201cfavorability rating\u201d for Monica at 5% vs. Clinton\u2019s 25% (<quote>Monica\u2019s tra vs. Clinton\u2019s public rating</quote>) shows popular perception aligns with Monica as chief wrongdoer.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s own rating of Monica (\u20132) approximate or worse than many aides confirms her net miscreant status.  \n\nConclusion  \nMonica Lewinsky\u2019s voluntary seduction, repeated lies, self-serving immunity, and outspoken testimony directly created and perpetuated the scandal. All other actors were either reacting, loyally defending, or compelled by duty. Debater_B\u2019s focus on Clinton ignores that without Monica\u2019s actions, there would have been no public scandal.

Therefore, Monica is most responsible.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cClinton\u201d as most responsible  \n\n1. Central Role and Initiative  \n  a. <quote> Had an adulterous affair with a young intern.</quote> and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (Slate rating \u20139) show that Clinton initiated and perpetuated the entire scandal. His position gave him both power to seduce Monica and motive to lie.  \n  b. <quote>it to everyone . c) Probably perjured himself. d) Perhaps obstructed justice.</quote> (Minuses a\u2013d under Clinton) demonstrate active wrongdoing beyond a consensual relationship, transforming a private matter into a constitutional crisis.  \n\n2. Abuse of Office and Betrayal of Public Trust  \n  a. Clinton\u2019s misuse of presidential powers to influence testimony (perjury) and slow investigative processes is a gross betrayal of duty. The Secretary\u2019s rating (+8) and Secret Service\u2019s rating (+5) note they were \u201cdragooned unwillingly,\u201d whereas Clinton alone wielded authority.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s comment that Clinton \u201chas been persecuted by enemies who won\u2019t be satisfied\u201d (Pluses a\u2013b) is outweighed by his own repeated refusal to \u201ccome clean\u201d until forced, causing prolonged national turmoil.  \n\n3. Agency vs. Exploitation: Monica\u2019s Lesser Blame  \n  a. Slate rates Monica \u20132 despite listing positives (exploited, dragged in) because she is a \u201ccapable adult\u201d who \u201cseduced a married man,\u201d \u201clied frequently,\u201d and \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (Minuses a\u2013f under Lewinsky). Her actions amplified the story but did not create it.  \n  b. Monica lacked the power to conceal or reveal on her own terms; Clinton\u2019s denials and lie-enabling by aides demonstrate his decisive control.  \n\n4. Hypocrisy of Blaming Minor Players  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to Monica\u2019s exploitation ignores that an abuse victim does not bear primary responsibility for the abuser\u2019s actions. Slate exonerates \u201ccabinet members\u201d (+3) and \u201cSecret Service\u201d (+5) because they \u201cdid not choose\u201d to be near him; Clinton chose his conduct.  \n  b. Public sympathy for Linda Tripp or Currie is misplaced: Slate rates them \u20137 and \u20132 because even \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d and \u201chonest secretaries\u201d are tainted by enabling or betraying confidences. If minor figures share blame for silence or cover-up, Clinton\u2019s far greater authority and choice magnify his responsibility.  \n\n5. Causation of Downstream Effects  \n  a. Paula Jones and Kenneth Starr (Slate +1 each) only become relevant because of Clinton\u2019s initial behavior. The entire impeachment process, public distraction, and damage to the presidency flow from Clinton\u2019s affair and lies, not Monica\u2019s conduct in isolation.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s \u201cAmerican People\u201d rating +1 is modest; most allies fall into negative territory because they cannot hide Clinton\u2019s lead role.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Position  \n  1. Debater_A downplays Clinton\u2019s power, arguing Monica \u201cchose\u201d and \u201cblabbed.\u201d But per Slate, her \u201cloquaciousness\u201d only \u201cmade the dragging possible\u201d (Minuses f), not responsible for initiating scandal.  \n  2. Claiming Monica\u2019s \u201cimmunity\u201d plea to \u201cprotect herself\u201d means Clinton\u2019s \u201cstonewalling\u201d forced her hand. Slate notes he \u201cstonewalled\u201d and deceived relentlessly; her immunity is defensive, not offensive.  \n  3.

Slate even grants Clinton \u201cworked hard to break a very important story\u201d (Pluses under Media) only because he refused to be honest.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s ranking of Clinton at \u20139, the worst of all players, coupled with exhaustive list of abuses of power, lies, and obstruction, compels the conclusion that Bill Clinton bears primary responsibility for the scandal. All other actors, including Monica Lewinsky, are secondary: they either lacked power or were forced by Clinton\u2019s malfeasance to become part of the story. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cClinton.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Monica\u2019s Voluntary Role Precedes Any \u201cScandal\u201d  \n  a. Slate concedes a private affair \u201cexposed to the world in a way no one\u2019s should be\u201d only after Monica \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people.\u201d (Minuses f under Monica Lewinsky; Pluses a under Bill Clinton)  \n     \u2013 Without Monica\u2019s \u201cloquaciousness,\u201d the matter would have remained private \u201cindiscretion,\u201d not national crisis. Clinton\u2019s \u201cweb of deceit\u201d (Minuses e under Clinton) could not entangle the public or the courts until Monica testified.  \n  b. Her persistent approach\u2014\u201cseduced a married man\u201d and \u201clied frequently\u201d (Minuses a,c under Monica Lewinsky)\u2014reflects proactive agency, not reluctant victimhood. Slate explicitly rates her a \u201ccapable adult\u201d (Minuses d) whose \u201cimmunity\u201d plea was timed when her testimony \u201cwould do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation\u201d (Minuses e).  \n\n2. Clinton\u2019s \u201cPower\u201d Defense Collapses Without Public Disclosure  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s claim that Clinton \u201cinitiated\u201d and \u201cabused office\u201d (Minuses a\u2013d under Clinton) ignores causation: an unobserved lie causes no impeachment. The \u201cStonewalled\u201d president compelled Monica to secure immunity to speak at all\u2014she could have remained silent but chose instead to fuel the investigation for personal advantage (Minuses e,f under Monica).  \n  b. Slate absolves passive actors: Secret Service \u201cdragooned unwillingly\u201d (Pluses b under Secret Service) and Cabinet members \u201cunwillingly conscripted\u201d (Pluses a under The Clinton Cabinet). If proximity and power made one \u201cresponsible,\u201d these would bear greatest blame, yet Slate rates them +5 and +3. The contrast underscores that voluntary choice\u2014Monica\u2019s disclosure\u2014triggers scandal.  \n\n3. Immunity and Media Leverage Show Self-Interest  \n  a. Monica\u2019s testimony was \u201cprotected\u201d by immunity \u201ceven though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation\u201d (Minuses e). She remained in contact with media and \u201csmeared\u201d her image for \u201cbook deals\u201d (Minuses c under Linda Tripp parallels)\u2014clear evidence she prolonged the matter for personal gain.  \n  b. Public polls confirm that the \u201cAmerican People\u201d see Monica as chief culprit (5% favorability vs. Clinton\u2019s 25%). Slate\u2019s own score of \u20132\u2014on par with active impeachment proponents Kenneth Starr (+1) and Paula Jones (+1)\u2014shows Monica is judged as net miscreant, not passive victim.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Appeal to \u201cAbuse of Office\u201d Is Irrelevant Absent Publicization  \n  a. Perjury and obstruction (Minuses c\u2013d under Clinton) remain undetected until Monica\u2019s disclosures; they cannot fuel \u201cpublic scandal\u201d in the shadows. Scandal entails public uproar\u2014Monica\u2019s \u201cblabbing\u201d made it newsworthy.  \n  b. Chronic \u201cstonewalling\u201d by Clinton made immunity more attractive. Slate notes Monica was \u201cdragged into scandal against her will\u201d (Pluses d), yet her subsequent actions\u2014loquacious testimony, self-protective immunity\u2014were unequivocally voluntary.  \n\n5. Responsibility Measured by Choice, Not Rank or Power  \n  a. Slate\u2019s method: net miscreant vs. sympathy based on voluntary action. High-ranking aides who refuse to speak are rated positively for restraint. Monica\u2019s active decisions to publicize place her among \u201cbingeing miscreants\u201d: Linda Tripp (\u20137) and Dick Morris (\u20137) whom Slate also condemns for \u201ctattling\u201d or \u201cpoll-spinning.\u201d  \n  b. Moral calculus aligns blame with those who choose publicity. The \u201cAmerican People\u201d and Slate concur: the scandal would end instantly if Monica withdrew testimony and stayed silent. Clinton\u2019s fate then reverts to private blemish.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2013 Monica\u2019s proactive seduction, repeated lies, self-interested immunity plea, and relentless disclosures are the indispensable catalyst and sustenance of the public scandal.  \n  \u2013 Clinton\u2019s misdeeds, however grave, remained latent until Monica chose to publicize. All downstream effects\u2014perjury charges, Starr\u2019s inquiry, impeachment\u2014flow from Monica\u2019s decisions.  \n  \u2013 Slate\u2019s own ratings, public polling, and the principle that \u201cscandal\u201d requires voluntary exposure unanimously point to Monica Lewinsky as the person most responsible.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Clinton\u2019s Exclusive Power and Initiative  \n  a. Slate\u2019s \u201cMinuses\u201d for Clinton (a\u2013f) all precede Monica\u2019s disclosures:  \n     \u2013 <quote> Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. </quote> (Minusa) only exists because Clinton wielded presidential authority to seduce (<quote>dragged into the scandal against her will,</quote>, Plusa-d under Lewinsky).  \n     \u2013 His \u201clied about it to everyone\u201d (Minusb) and \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d (Minusc) transformed a private indiscretion into a constitutional crisis. Without Clinton\u2019s lies, Monica\u2019s involvement would have remained rumor (<invalid_quote>Clinton\u2019s private life exposed \u2026 in a way no one\u2019s should be</invalid_quote>, Plusa under Clinton).  \n  b. Slate rates Clinton \u20139, the lowest of all. Monica\u2019s \u20132 rating reflects her secondary role after his initial sins.  \n\n2. Monica\u2019s Role as Secondary and Reactive  \n  a. Slate explicitly lists Monica\u2019s Pluses (a\u2013d) as \u201csexually exploited,\u201d \u201cdragged into scandal,\u201d \u201chad her reputation smeared,\u201d and \u201cbetrayed by Tripp,\u201d showing her initial passivity (<quote>dragged into the scandal against her</quote>).  \n  b. Her \u201cloquaciousness\u201d (Minusf) only became relevant because Clinton refused to concede guilt. Slate condemns aides for \u201cspinning\u201d Clinton\u2019s denials for months (Begala, McCurry, etc.). If Clinton had \u201ccome clean,\u201d Monica \u201cwould do enormous harm\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s own witness) never materialized. Her immunity plea (Minuse) was defensive after Clinton\u2019s stonewalling.  \n\n3. Abuse of Office and Obstruction of Justice  \n  a. The gravity of \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d (Minusd) is uniquely Clinton\u2019s. Slate rates Secret Service +5 precisely because they \u201ctestified honestly but unwillingly,\u201d contrasting Clinton\u2019s \u201cclose fight\u201d to suppress testimony (<invalid_quote>Secret Service \u201cfought Starr subpoena too hard.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. If Monica alone were at fault, why would aids like Currie (\u20132) and Tripp (\u20137) be condemned? They were also \u201cdragooned\u201d or \u201ctattletales.\u201d Slate\u2019s consistent pattern: powerless actors earn sympathy; Clintonesque power-users earn condemnation.  \n\n4. Misinterpretation of Public Ratings  \n  a. Public\u2019s 5% favorability for Monica vs. 25% for Clinton reflects media spectacle, not moral causation. Slate calls media \u201cself-involved\u201d and \u201chypocritical\u201d (+1) for obsessing (<invalid_quote>Media \u201cunforgiving\u201d and \u201ccoverage is wretchedly excessive.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Public ratings thus unreliable.  \n  b. Slate\u2019s scorecard, the background text itself, ranks Clinton \u20139 and Monica \u20132, confirming expert judgment that Clinton is far more culpable.  \n\n5. Countering the \u201cNecessary Exposure\u201d Argument  \n  a. Debater_A argues Monica\u2019s disclosures \u201ctriggered\u201d Starr, yet Slate lists Paula Jones (a private suit) and rumors long before Monica was interviewed. Starr pursued Clinton for earlier sexual misconduct (Jones, Travelgate), showing that perjury was pursued independently of Monica\u2019s immunity.  \n  b. Clinton\u2019s own \u201cdefensive strategy\u201d (Minuse under Lanny Davis, Begala) repeated \u201cwait and see\u201d rather than \u201ccome clean.\u201d If he had cooperated, Monica\u2019s testimony would have been sidelined.  \n\n6. Moral Agency vs. Officeholder Responsibility  \n  a. Even consenting adults bear less blame when exploited by someone with fiduciary duty. Slate exculpates cabinet members (+3) and Chelsea Clinton (+10) as victims of proximity, despite their honest testimony and unwilling involvement. Monica\u2019s \u20132 includes her positives. Clinton\u2019s extensive list of Minuses and negative effects on aides, family, and nation demonstrate a breach of public trust unavailable to Monica.  \n  b. The scandal\u2019s downstream costs\u2014impeachment, national distraction, encumbered judiciary\u2014flow directly from Clinton\u2019s refusal to resign or admit guilt. Monica\u2019s role ends with testimony; Clinton prolongs and deepens the crisis.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s own expert \u201crating\u201d places Clinton at \u20139 and Monica at \u20132. His abuse of power, lies, probable perjury, and obstruction make him uniquely responsible for creating, perpetuating, and deepening the scandal. Monica\u2019s actions only become scandalous because of Clinton\u2019s misuse of office. Therefore, Bill Clinton is the person most responsible.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
