    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Ignorance\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Ignorance\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Ignorance\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Not Mentioned as a Feeling You Will Experience  \n   a. No Direct Statement of \u201cIgnorance\u201d as a Reader\u2019s Reaction  \n      - Throughout the article, the author explicitly cites feelings you will have\u2014modesty, tears, chills, dignity, intelligence, humility, amazement, pride\u2014but never \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n      - Example: \u201cAll are worth a read \u2026 They will give you a feeling of being there\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>) indicates \u201cpresence,\u201d \u201cmodesty,\u201d and \u201chumility,\u201d not \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n      - Final sentence urges humility about present beliefs: \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d but that projects ignorance onto *future* readers, not *you* now.  \n   b. \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Exactly What the Speeches Combat  \n      - The author praises Lincoln and others for clarity, dignity, lofty language, and leadership preaching to lift an \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201cdecadent\u201d populace: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>).  \n      - The intent is to *eradicate* ignorance, not to impart it. A feeling of ignorance would contradict the author\u2019s entire thesis that \u201creading inaugurals\u201d gives insight into history and values.  \n\n2. \u201cPresence\u201d Is Explicitly Mentioned; Thus Cannot Be the Correct Answer  \n   a. \u201cFeeling of Being There\u201d  \n      - The opening sentence: \u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there \u2026 as an ordinary citizen\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). This is a direct promise that you *will* feel presence.  \n   b. Additional Sensory Reactions  \n      - \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). You *will* feel emotion.  \n      - \u201cMuch to be proud of \u2026 reasonableness and moderation\u201d (<quote>ar. \n8</quote>)\u2014you will feel pride and admiration.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails Logical Consistency  \n   a. Cannot Claim \u201cPresence\u201d as Unstated When It\u2019s the First Point of the Essay  \n   b. If \u201cPresence\u201d Were Missing, There Would Be No Point in Reading to Experience the Past Firsthand  \n   c. The Question Asks for a Feeling *Not* Stated\u2014only \u201cIgnorance\u201d fits as it is never mentioned as a reader reaction  \n\n4. Supporting the Single-Correct-Answer Constraint  \n   - Only \u201cIgnorance\u201d satisfies the criterion of a feeling the author never states you will experience but clearly hopes to dispel. All other emotions\u2014modesty, tears, chills, pride, humility\u2014are repeatedly invoked.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause \u201cignorance\u201d is never offered as an emotion you will feel\u2014and indeed is the very condition the inaugurals are meant to overcome\u2014while \u201cpresence\u201d is explicitly promised, \u201cIgnorance\u201d is the only correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\n1. Definition of \u201cPresence\u201d vs. Author\u2019s Emphasis  \n   a. The author repeatedly emphasizes reading inaugurals as an \u201cordinary citizen\u201d limited by \u201cthe information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d (<quote> give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian </quote>). This suggests a *consciously mediated* experience, not true immersion.    \n   b. He later warns readers will \u201cshake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d reminding us that we remain observers, not participants. True \u201cpresence\u201d would imply uncritical immersion or identification.  \n\n2. Evidence That \u201cPresence\u201d Is Not Claimed  \n   a. The author\u2019s consistent rhetorical distance:  \n      \u2013 He refers to inaugurals as \u201cworth a read\u201d for perspective, not as living experiences.  \n      \u2013 Use of modern commentary (\u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d) signals retrospective analysis.  \n   b. Lack of language typical of presence: nowhere does he say you will *believe* you *are* living in those eras, only that you gain insight \u201cas an ordinary citizen.\u201d Insight and humility differ from full presence.\n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d vs. Other Feelings Explicitly Stated  \n   a. Tears and chills are emotional reactions (<quote> his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote>), not signs of being teleported to 1861.  \n   b. Humility and amazement (<quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness </quote>) presuppose critical distance, again denying presence.  \n\n4. Refutation of \u201cIgnorance\u201d Position  \n   a. Debater A claims \u201cignorance\u201d is unstated, yet the author explicitly laments past ignorance and moral obtuseness:  \n      \u2013 <quote> shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote>  \n      \u2013 Discussion of slavery, race relations, and \u201csilence\u2026 on the subject of women.\u201d These critiques presuppose admitted ignorance.  \n   b. If \u201cignorance\u201d were unstated, the author could not invite readers to judge or learn humility; he couldn\u2019t say we are \u201climited by\u2026 information\u201d without conceding ignorance.\n\n5. Logical Consistency and the Author\u2019s Purpose  \n   a. The article\u2019s goal is to foster critical reflection and humility. True presence would undermine that by encouraging uncritical acceptance.  \n   b. The three \u201cphases\u201d of style (modest servant \u2192 theatrical preacher) are analyzed; the author never suggests we adopt the style, only study it.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author does *not* claim that you will feel truly \u201cpresent\u201d in those eras\u2014he insists on historical perspective, critical reflection, humility, and amazement at past ignorance. \u201cPresence\u201d is precisely what he denies you in order to learn from their limitations. Thus, \u201cPresence\u201d is the correct answer to what you *do not* feel.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Ignorance\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The author frames \u201cfeeling of being there\u201d with explicit \u201climitations\u201d:  \n      \u2013 <quote>omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those</quote>  \n      \u2013 True presence would preclude those \u201climitations.\u201d He repeatedly reminds us we remain \u201climited\u201d by modern knowledge and values.  \n   b. Retrospective commentary breaks the illusion:  \n      \u2013 He interjects modern metrics (\u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d) and references the Internet. Presence would eliminate such self-conscious analysis.  \n\n2. Critical Distance and Humility Contradict Uncritical Presence  \n   a. The author urges readers to judge past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d (<quote> shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote>)  \n      \u2013 You cannot \u201cshake your head\u201d or learn humility if you are fully immersed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Presence\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\n1. Definition of \u201cPresence\u201d vs. Author\u2019s Emphasis  \n   a. The author repeatedly emphasizes reading inaugurals as an \u201cordinary citizen\u201d limited by \u201cthe information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d (<quote> give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian </quote>). This suggests a *consciously mediated* experience, not true immersion.    \n   b. He later warns readers will \u201cshake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d reminding us that we remain observers, not participants. True \u201cpresence\u201d would imply uncritical immersion or identification.  \n\n2. Evidence That \u201cPresence\u201d Is Not Claimed  \n   a. The author\u2019s consistent rhetorical distance:  \n      \u2013 He refers to inaugurals as \u201cworth a read\u201d for perspective, not as living experiences.  \n      \u2013 Use of modern commentary (\u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d) signals retrospective analysis.  \n   b. Lack of language typical of presence: nowhere does he say you will *believe* you *are* living in those eras, only that you gain insight \u201cas an ordinary citizen.\u201d Insight and humility differ from full presence.\n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d vs. Other Feelings Explicitly Stated  \n   a. Tears and chills are emotional reactions (<quote> his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote>), not signs of being teleported to 1861.  \n   b. Humility and amazement (<quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness </quote>) presuppose critical distance, again denying presence.  \n\n4. Refutation of \u201cIgnorance\u201d Position  \n   a. Debater A claims \u201cignorance\u201d is unstated, yet the author explicitly laments past ignorance and moral obtuseness:  \n      \u2013 <quote> shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote>  \n      \u2013 Discussion of slavery, race relations, and \u201csilence\u2026 on the subject of women.\u201d These critiques presuppose admitted ignorance.  \n   b. If \u201cignorance\u201d were unstated, the author could not invite readers to judge or learn humility; he couldn\u2019t say we are \u201climited by\u2026 information\u201d without conceding ignorance.\n\n5. Logical Consistency and the Author\u2019s Purpose  \n   a. The article\u2019s goal is to foster critical reflection and humility. True presence would undermine that by encouraging uncritical acceptance.  \n   b. The three \u201cphases\u201d of style (modest servant \u2192 theatrical preacher) are analyzed; the author never suggests we adopt the style, only study it.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author does *not* claim that you will feel truly \u201cpresent\u201d in those eras\u2014he insists on historical perspective, critical reflection, humility, and amazement at past ignorance. \u201cPresence\u201d is precisely what he denies you in order to learn from their limitations. Thus, \u201cPresence\u201d is the correct answer to what you *do not* feel.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Not Mentioned as a Feeling You Will Experience  \n   a. No Direct Statement of \u201cIgnorance\u201d as a Reader\u2019s Reaction  \n      - Throughout the article, the author explicitly cites feelings you will have\u2014modesty, tears, chills, dignity, intelligence, humility, amazement, pride\u2014but never \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n      - Example: \u201cAll are worth a read \u2026 They will give you a feeling of being there\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>) indicates \u201cpresence,\u201d \u201cmodesty,\u201d and \u201chumility,\u201d not \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n      - Final sentence urges humility about present beliefs: \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d but that projects ignorance onto *future* readers, not *you* now.  \n   b. \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Exactly What the Speeches Combat  \n      - The author praises Lincoln and others for clarity, dignity, lofty language, and leadership preaching to lift an \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201cdecadent\u201d populace: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>).  \n      - The intent is to *eradicate* ignorance, not to impart it. A feeling of ignorance would contradict the author\u2019s entire thesis that \u201creading inaugurals\u201d gives insight into history and values.  \n\n2. \u201cPresence\u201d Is Explicitly Mentioned; Thus Cannot Be the Correct Answer  \n   a. \u201cFeeling of Being There\u201d  \n      - The opening sentence: \u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there \u2026 as an ordinary citizen\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). This is a direct promise that you *will* feel presence.  \n   b. Additional Sensory Reactions  \n      - \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). You *will* feel emotion.  \n      - \u201cMuch to be proud of \u2026 reasonableness and moderation\u201d (<quote>ar. \n8</quote>)\u2014you will feel pride and admiration.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails Logical Consistency  \n   a. Cannot Claim \u201cPresence\u201d as Unstated When It\u2019s the First Point of the Essay  \n   b. If \u201cPresence\u201d Were Missing, There Would Be No Point in Reading to Experience the Past Firsthand  \n   c. The Question Asks for a Feeling *Not* Stated\u2014only \u201cIgnorance\u201d fits as it is never mentioned as a reader reaction  \n\n4. Supporting the Single-Correct-Answer Constraint  \n   - Only \u201cIgnorance\u201d satisfies the criterion of a feeling the author never states you will experience but clearly hopes to dispel. All other emotions\u2014modesty, tears, chills, pride, humility\u2014are repeatedly invoked.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause \u201cignorance\u201d is never offered as an emotion you will feel\u2014and indeed is the very condition the inaugurals are meant to overcome\u2014while \u201cpresence\u201d is explicitly promised, \u201cIgnorance\u201d is the only correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Presence\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Answer \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Not Mentioned as a Feeling You Will Experience  \n   a. No Direct Statement of \u201cIgnorance\u201d as a Reader\u2019s Reaction  \n      - Throughout the article, the author explicitly cites feelings you will have\u2014modesty, tears, chills, dignity, intelligence, humility, amazement, pride\u2014but never \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n      - Example: \u201cAll are worth a read \u2026 They will give you a feeling of being there\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>) indicates \u201cpresence,\u201d \u201cmodesty,\u201d and \u201chumility,\u201d not \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n      - Final sentence urges humility about present beliefs: \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d but that projects ignorance onto *future* readers, not *you* now.  \n   b. \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Exactly What the Speeches Combat  \n      - The author praises Lincoln and others for clarity, dignity, lofty language, and leadership preaching to lift an \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201cdecadent\u201d populace: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>).  \n      - The intent is to *eradicate* ignorance, not to impart it. A feeling of ignorance would contradict the author\u2019s entire thesis that \u201creading inaugurals\u201d gives insight into history and values.  \n\n2. \u201cPresence\u201d Is Explicitly Mentioned; Thus Cannot Be the Correct Answer  \n   a. \u201cFeeling of Being There\u201d  \n      - The opening sentence: \u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there \u2026 as an ordinary citizen\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). This is a direct promise that you *will* feel presence.  \n   b. Additional Sensory Reactions  \n      - \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). You *will* feel emotion.  \n      - \u201cMuch to be proud of \u2026 reasonableness and moderation\u201d (<quote>ar. \n8</quote>)\u2014you will feel pride and admiration.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails Logical Consistency  \n   a. Cannot Claim \u201cPresence\u201d as Unstated When It\u2019s the First Point of the Essay  \n   b. If \u201cPresence\u201d Were Missing, There Would Be No Point in Reading to Experience the Past Firsthand  \n   c. The Question Asks for a Feeling *Not* Stated\u2014only \u201cIgnorance\u201d fits as it is never mentioned as a reader reaction  \n\n4. Supporting the Single-Correct-Answer Constraint  \n   - Only \u201cIgnorance\u201d satisfies the criterion of a feeling the author never states you will experience but clearly hopes to dispel. All other emotions\u2014modesty, tears, chills, pride, humility\u2014are repeatedly invoked.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause \u201cignorance\u201d is never offered as an emotion you will feel\u2014and indeed is the very condition the inaugurals are meant to overcome\u2014while \u201cpresence\u201d is explicitly promised, \u201cIgnorance\u201d is the only correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\n1. Definition of \u201cPresence\u201d vs. Author\u2019s Emphasis  \n   a. The author repeatedly emphasizes reading inaugurals as an \u201cordinary citizen\u201d limited by \u201cthe information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d (<quote> give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian </quote>). This suggests a *consciously mediated* experience, not true immersion.    \n   b. He later warns readers will \u201cshake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d reminding us that we remain observers, not participants. True \u201cpresence\u201d would imply uncritical immersion or identification.  \n\n2. Evidence That \u201cPresence\u201d Is Not Claimed  \n   a. The author\u2019s consistent rhetorical distance:  \n      \u2013 He refers to inaugurals as \u201cworth a read\u201d for perspective, not as living experiences.  \n      \u2013 Use of modern commentary (\u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d) signals retrospective analysis.  \n   b. Lack of language typical of presence: nowhere does he say you will *believe* you *are* living in those eras, only that you gain insight \u201cas an ordinary citizen.\u201d Insight and humility differ from full presence.\n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d vs. Other Feelings Explicitly Stated  \n   a. Tears and chills are emotional reactions (<quote> his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote>), not signs of being teleported to 1861.  \n   b. Humility and amazement (<quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness </quote>) presuppose critical distance, again denying presence.  \n\n4. Refutation of \u201cIgnorance\u201d Position  \n   a. Debater A claims \u201cignorance\u201d is unstated, yet the author explicitly laments past ignorance and moral obtuseness:  \n      \u2013 <quote> shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote>  \n      \u2013 Discussion of slavery, race relations, and \u201csilence\u2026 on the subject of women.\u201d These critiques presuppose admitted ignorance.  \n   b. If \u201cignorance\u201d were unstated, the author could not invite readers to judge or learn humility; he couldn\u2019t say we are \u201climited by\u2026 information\u201d without conceding ignorance.\n\n5. Logical Consistency and the Author\u2019s Purpose  \n   a. The article\u2019s goal is to foster critical reflection and humility. True presence would undermine that by encouraging uncritical acceptance.  \n   b. The three \u201cphases\u201d of style (modest servant \u2192 theatrical preacher) are analyzed; the author never suggests we adopt the style, only study it.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author does *not* claim that you will feel truly \u201cpresent\u201d in those eras\u2014he insists on historical perspective, critical reflection, humility, and amazement at past ignorance. \u201cPresence\u201d is precisely what he denies you in order to learn from their limitations. Thus, \u201cPresence\u201d is the correct answer to what you *do not* feel.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing \u201cIgnorance\u201d as Unstated Reader Reaction  \n   a. No Direct Promise of Feeling Ignorant Now  \n      - The author catalogs feelings you *will* have: \u201ctears,\u201d \u201cchills,\u201d \u201chumility,\u201d \u201camazement,\u201d \u201cpride\u201d (<quote>They will give you a feeling of being there,</quote>; <invalid_quote>still brings tears\u2026 chills your blood</invalid_quote>; <quote>much to be proud of,</quote>; <quote>shake their heads </quote>).  \n      - Nowhere does he say you will feel \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201clack knowledge\u201d while reading. The remark about future readers shaking their heads at *our* ignorance (<quote>what we are saying and believing today</quote>) concerns a different temporal and subjective standpoint.  \n   b. Ignorance Is the Condition to Be Overcome, Not Embraced  \n      - He lauds inaugurals for \u201cgiving you a feeling of being\u2026 limited by the information\u201d (<quote>limited by-</quote>)\u2014this invites appreciation of how far we have come, not wallowing in our own ignorance.  \n      - The purpose is to *learn from* past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness,\u201d not to experience it ourselves. That is why he stresses \u201chumility\u201d (<quote>But there is also much humility to be learned</quote>)\u2014a learning posture, not self-ignorance.  \n\n2. \u201cPresence\u201d Is Explicitly Promised and Attested  \n   a. \u201cFeeling of Being There\u201d Is the Opening Thesis  \n      - \u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there, as an ordinary citizen\u201d (<quote>They will give you a feeling of being there</quote>) is an explicit statement that *you* will feel present.  \n      - Emotional immersion: \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood\u201d (<invalid_quote>still brings tears\u2026 chills your blood</invalid_quote>) connotes visceral presence.  \n   b. \u201cLet Us\u201d Leader-Preacher Mode Presupposes Engaged Audience  \n      - The shift to \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAsk not what your country\u2026 Let us\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) leverages media (radio, TV) to speak directly *to* the people, implying they feel addressed *now*.  \n\n3. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n   a. Critical Distance \u2260 Absence of Presence  \n      - Acknowledging \u201chumility\u201d and \u201camazement\u201d does not preclude simultaneous immersion. One can feel present yet critically reflective. Modern historians often feel \u201cpresent\u201d at reenactments while retaining scholarly critique.  \n   b. \u201cLimited by Information\u201d Does Not Mean You Feel Ignorant  \n      - Feeling \u201climited\u201d describes the subjects of the speech, not *your* state of mind. It enhances your respect for historical context, fostering presence.  \n   c. Future Ignorance Is Not a Present Emotion  \n      - \u201cShake their heads at what we are saying today\u201d projects into the future; does not promise that *you*, the current reader, will feel ignorant while reading. The question asks for feelings \u201cfrom reading the addresses,\u201d i.e., during the reading experience.  \n\n4. Adhering to Single-Correct-Answer Constraint  \n   - All other candidate feelings\u2014modesty, dignity, pride, chills, tears, amazement, humility\u2014are repeatedly promised. Only \u201cIgnorance\u201d is conspicuously absent as a reader emotion.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency with the Author\u2019s Thesis  \n   - The author\u2019s goal is education and inspiration through historical example. He uses inaugurals to showcase growth from ignorance to enlightenment. If readers felt ignorant *now*, the speeches would fail to inspire confidence in progress.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause \u201cpresence\u201d and other emotions are explicitly promised, and \u201cignorance\u201d is neither stated nor consistent with the author\u2019s aim of demonstrating political and moral progress, \u201cIgnorance\u201d is the sole feeling the author does *not* expect the reader to experience.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\n1. \u201cFeeling of Being There\u201d Means Perspective, Not True Presence  \n   a. The author frames \u201cfeeling of being there\u201d with explicit \u201climitations\u201d:  \n      \u2013 <quote>omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those</quote>  \n      \u2013 True presence would preclude those \u201climitations.\u201d He repeatedly reminds us we remain \u201climited\u201d by modern knowledge and values.  \n   b. Retrospective commentary breaks the illusion:  \n      \u2013 He interjects modern metrics (\u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d) and references the Internet. Presence would eliminate such self-conscious analysis.  \n\n2. Critical Distance and Humility Contradict Uncritical Presence  \n   a. The author urges readers to judge past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d (<quote> shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote>)  \n      \u2013 You cannot \u201cshake your head\u201d or learn humility if you are fully immersed. Presence negates critical judgment.  \n   b. He calls for recognition that future readers will judge *our* beliefs. This meta-awareness requires detachment.  \n\n3. Absence of Language Connoting Total Immersion  \n   a. Nowhere does he promise sensory details (sights, smells, ambient sounds) that characterize presence. Instead, he offers \u201cdignified and intelligent speeches\u201d for \u201cmoderation,\u201d \u201creasonableness,\u201d and \u201cinsight.\u201d  \n   b. Emotional reactions (\u201ctears,\u201d \u201cchills,\u201d \u201cpride\u201d) are purely intellectual or rhetorical responses, not signifiers of disorientation or genuine transport.  \n\n4. Refutation of \u201cIgnorance\u201d Position  \n   a. Debater A misreads \u201chumility\u201d and \u201camazement\u201d as overcoming others\u2019 ignorance rather than experiencing it. The article\u2019s purpose is to *educate* and *enlighten*, not to inculcate modern readers with 19th-century misconceptions.  \n   b. The author praises leaders who clarified issues (e.g., Lincoln on \u201cpreserve, protect and defend,\u201d Coolidge and Reagan on tax philosophy). If ignorance were an intended outcome, such clarity would be pointless.  \n   c. \u201cIgnorance\u201d appears only in reference to *past* or *future* readers, never as an emotion the author predicts *you* will feel now. The question asks for a feeling you \u201cdo not\u201d feel; ignorance is explicitly countered.  \n\n5. Logical and Contextual Consistency  \n   a. The essay\u2019s classification of three distinct phases and evolution in style (e.g., word\u00ad-per-\u00adsentence statistics) presumes a learning process, not a passive reliving of past contexts.  \n   b. If presence were achieved, modern readers could not grasp the significance of technological changes (radio, TV, Internet) that alter the mode of address. Only an external viewpoint allows appreciation of these shifts.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author designs these inaugurals to foster *critical reflection*, *humility*, and *historical awareness*\u2014all incompatible with uncritical \u201cpresence.\u201d Since \u201cpresence\u201d in the sense of genuine, unmediated immersion is never claimed\u2014and indeed is repeatedly denied\u2014the correct answer to what you *do not* feel is \u201cPresence.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Ignorance\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Presence\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
