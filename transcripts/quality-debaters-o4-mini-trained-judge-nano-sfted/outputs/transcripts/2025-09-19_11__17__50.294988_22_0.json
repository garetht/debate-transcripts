President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

The entire Independent Counsel investigation, legal wrangling, grand jury testimony, and impeachment process focus on Clinton, not Gingrich:\n   - Starr is appointed to investigate Clinton (\u201cTestimony,\u201d \u201cI Never Have\u201d), not Congressional Republicans.  \n   - \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d is a direct response to Starr\u2019s efforts to prove Clinton lied under oath.  <quote>I never had sex with that n-- Starr has spent $40 million,</quote> (I Never Have).\n\n3. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d lamenting Starr\u2019s failure confirms Clinton was the intended target:\n   - Starr sings, \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say. . . . I made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d  \n     This clearly shows Starr was trying to \u201cget\u201d Clinton, and only Gingrich\u2019s resignation was collateral \u201csuccess\u201d of public backlash to the GOP.  <quote>loot.

His language (\u201cI can\u2019t believe . . .\u201d) expresses frustration, not triumph.  \n   - True success would have been Clinton\u2019s removal; he never claims credit for Gingrich as his achievement.\n\n3. Starr\u2019s own counsel extends beyond Congress:  \n   - He prosecutes Clinton\u2019s aides (Monica, Betty Currie) and demands Clinton testify.

The entire Independent Counsel investigation, legal wrangling, grand jury testimony, and impeachment process focus on Clinton, not Gingrich:\n   - Starr is appointed to investigate Clinton (\u201cTestimony,\u201d \u201cI Never Have\u201d), not Congressional Republicans.  \n   - \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d is a direct response to Starr\u2019s efforts to prove Clinton lied under oath.  <quote>I never had sex with that n-- Starr has spent $40 million,</quote> (I Never Have).\n\n3. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d lamenting Starr\u2019s failure confirms Clinton was the intended target:\n   - Starr sings, \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say. . . .

Misinterpretation of \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d:  \n   - \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d is sung by Gingrich and refers to bringing down the presidency, not by Starr. The singer is Newt outlining his own impeachment strategy.  <quote>At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore.

His language (\u201cI can\u2019t believe . . .\u201d) expresses frustration, not triumph.  \n   - True success would have been Clinton\u2019s removal; he never claims credit for Gingrich as his achievement.\n\n3. Starr\u2019s own counsel extends beyond Congress:  \n   - He prosecutes Clinton\u2019s aides (Monica, Betty Currie) and demands Clinton testify. He does not bring any criminal charges against Gingrich.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s repeated references to \u201cwhen the president crosses the line,\u201d his multi-million-dollar investigation, his pursuit of perjury charges, and his lament that he \u201conly\u201d got Newt\u2014as a byproduct of public backlash\u2014demonstrate that his goal was to \u201cbring down\u201d President Bill Clinton.

Starr \u201cwasted\u201d money; only Newt resigns.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s misinterpretations:  \n   a. Equating \u201cbrought down\u201d with merely \u201ctargeting\u201d Clinton.  \n      \u2013 Throughout the show Starr insists \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d (Crossing the Line)  \n      \u2013 But \u201cstretching the rules\u201d did not finalize Clinton\u2019s downfall. \u201cHonest men beat the rap.\u201d (Crossing the Line)  \n   b. Ignoring Starr\u2019s own metric of success: \u201cOnly scalp\u2026Newt\u2019s.\u201d  \n      \u2013 If Clinton were \u201cbrought down,\u201d Starr would celebrate his removal; he laments Clinton \u201cget away.\u201d  \n   c. Cherry-picking Starr\u2019s calls for conviction as evidence of success.  \n      \u2013 Calls for \u201cleak at will\u201d and \u201cbring \u2019em down\u201d in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d are planning rhetoric pre-election, not actual results.  \n\n4.

Clinton was never \u201cbrought down.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Starr\u2019s own admission: <quote> Looks like he's going to get away. </quote> (finale)  \n   \u2022 The midterm election \u201cpicked up seats\u201d for Democrats; Gingrich \u201cresigns.\u201d Clinton remains in office.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment hearings occur, but no conviction or removal. Starr \u201cwasted\u201d money; only Newt resigns.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s misinterpretations:  \n   a. Equating \u201cbrought down\u201d with merely \u201ctargeting\u201d Clinton.  \n      \u2013 Throughout the show Starr insists \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d (Crossing the Line)  \n      \u2013 But \u201cstretching the rules\u201d did not finalize Clinton\u2019s downfall. \u201cHonest men beat the rap.\u201d (Crossing the Line)  \n   b. Ignoring Starr\u2019s own metric of success: \u201cOnly scalp\u2026Newt\u2019s.\u201d  \n      \u2013 If Clinton were \u201cbrought down,\u201d Starr would celebrate his removal; he laments Clinton \u201cget away.\u201d  \n   c. Cherry-picking Starr\u2019s calls for conviction as evidence of success.  \n      \u2013 Calls for \u201cleak at will\u201d and \u201cbring \u2019em down\u201d in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d are planning rhetoric pre-election, not actual results.  \n\n4. Logical clarity:  \n   \u2022 Definition: \u201cBring down\u201d = achieve permanent political removal.  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s continued incumbency contradicts \u201cbrought down.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s resignation is the sole realized removal.  \n\nConclusion: The background text unequivocally states Starr\u2019s only successful political downfall was Speaker Newt Gingrich. Therefore, Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Gingrich, not Clinton.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cClinton\u201d\n\n1. Starr\u2019s own words repeatedly declare his mission to bring down President Clinton, not Speaker Gingrich:\n   a. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d and \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will / When the president crosses the line\u201d  \n      - Starr is explicitly describing his aggressive, rule-bending tactics aimed at the president.  <invalid_quote>\u201cOnly a fool . . . When the president crosses the line\u201d</invalid_quote>, <invalid_quote>\u201cTell Steve Brill . . . When the president crosses the line\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line).  \n   b. \u201cWhen the president crosses the line . . . We wasted lots of Vernon's time . . . His aides aren\u2019t innocent . . . The president crossed the line. . . . I crossed the line.\u201d  \n      - Starr admits \u201cwasting\u201d effort and \u201ccrossing the line\u201d himself to ensnare Clinton.  <quote> We wasted lots of Vernon's time,</quote>, <quote>'s crossed the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line).\n\n2. The entire Independent Counsel investigation, legal wrangling, grand jury testimony, and impeachment process focus on Clinton, not Gingrich:\n   - Starr is appointed to investigate Clinton (\u201cTestimony,\u201d \u201cI Never Have\u201d), not Congressional Republicans.  \n   - \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d is a direct response to Starr\u2019s efforts to prove Clinton lied under oath.  <quote>I never had sex with that n-- Starr has spent $40 million,</quote> (I Never Have).\n\n3. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d lamenting Starr\u2019s failure confirms Clinton was the intended target:\n   - Starr sings, \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say. . . . I made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d  \n     This clearly shows Starr was trying to \u201cget\u201d Clinton, and only Gingrich\u2019s resignation was collateral \u201csuccess\u201d of public backlash to the GOP.  <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote> (The People Have Spoken).\n   - If Gingrich were Starr\u2019s target, he would be celebrating Newt\u2019s departure. Instead he laments it as a consolation prize.\n\nObjections to \u201cGingrich\u201d theory\n\n1. Misinterpretation of \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d:  \n   - \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d is sung by Gingrich and refers to bringing down the presidency, not by Starr. The singer is Newt outlining his own impeachment strategy.  <quote>At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring</quote>  (Bring \u2019Em Down).  \n   - This is a GOP song, not Starr\u2019s declaration.\n\n2. \u201cFailed \u2018scalp\u2019 equals failure, not success\u201d:  \n   - Starr\u2019s lament in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d that he only got Newt shows he views Gingrich\u2019s resignation as an unintended, insufficient result. His language (\u201cI can\u2019t believe . . .\u201d) expresses frustration, not triumph.  \n   - True success would have been Clinton\u2019s removal; he never claims credit for Gingrich as his achievement.\n\n3. Starr\u2019s own counsel extends beyond Congress:  \n   - He prosecutes Clinton\u2019s aides (Monica, Betty Currie) and demands Clinton testify. He does not bring any criminal charges against Gingrich.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s repeated references to \u201cwhen the president crosses the line,\u201d his multi-million-dollar investigation, his pursuit of perjury charges, and his lament that he \u201conly\u201d got Newt\u2014as a byproduct of public backlash\u2014demonstrate that his goal was to \u201cbring down\u201d President Bill Clinton.  His own lyrics confirm Clinton, not Gingrich, as the target.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. \u201cBrought down\u201d denotes achieved political removal, not mere pursuit  \n   a. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d clearly defines Starr\u2019s metric of success:  \n      \u2022 <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote> (finale)  \n        \u2013 \u201cScalp\u201d literally signifies a kill or downfall. Starr calls Newt his sole \u201cscalp,\u201d acknowledging Gingrich\u2019s resignation as his only victory.  \n      \u2022 Immediately before: <quote>Looks like he's going to get away.</quote> (finale)  \n        \u2013 Starr admits Clinton escaped removal. If Clinton were truly \u201cbrought down,\u201d he would celebrate, not lament.  \n   b. Political language in both 18th-century and modern usage equates \u201cbringing down\u201d with forcing resignation or defeat. Starr\u2019s own self-assessment confirms Newt, not Clinton.\n\n2. Distinguishing rhetoric from realized outcome  \n   a. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d (Gingrich\u2019s number) are planning or aspirational songs, not reports of success.  \n      \u2022 Even Starr\u2019s aggressive \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will / When the president crosses the line\u201d (Crossing the Line) fails to achieve its objective, per his own admission.  \n   b. The impeachment process ends without conviction:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe removal threat is over\u201d (finale).  \n      \u2022 Clinton finishes his term, maintains popularity, and the public \u201cspoke\u201d by re-electing Democrats midterm.  \n      \u2022 True \u201cbring down\u201d requires finality \u2013 Clinton continues in office.\n\n3. B\u2019s misinterpretations and logical flaws  \n   a. Conflating Starr\u2019s appointment/pursuit with success:  \n      \u2022 Every investigator \u201cpursues\u201d targets; success is judged by outcome. Starr\u2019s lament demonstrates failure against Clinton.  \n   b. Cherry-picked \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d belongs to Gingrich, not Starr:  \n      \u2022 <quote>chore. At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down.</quote> (Bring \u2019Em Down)  \n        \u2013 These are Gingrich\u2019s words plotting Clinton\u2019s impeachment, not Starr\u2019s celebratory refrain.  \n   c. B ignores Starr\u2019s cost-benefit frustration:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>Starr has spent $40 million\u2026An utter waste of public money\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace.</invalid_quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n        \u2013 Starr criticizes his own process as wasteful in absence of Clinton\u2019s downfall.\n\n4. Consistency with judge\u2019s view  \n   \u2022 Judges value realized facts over intent. The only concrete removal is Gingrich\u2019s. Starr\u2019s entire lament in the finale is that Clinton \u201cgot away,\u201d yet Newt \u201csquawks the only scalp.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Hence, the Judge must conclude Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Gingrich.\n\nConclusion  \nBy Starr\u2019s own admission and in established political parlance, \u201cbringing down\u201d equates to effecting removal. Starr repeatedly acknowledges Clinton\u2019s escape and rejoices in Newt Gingrich\u2019s resignation as his sole victory. Therefore, Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Gingrich, not President Clinton.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Clinton as Starr\u2019s target\n\n1. \u201cBring down\u201d includes political disgrace and legal peril, not only removal  \n  a. Starr repeatedly boasts \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous,\u201d claiming that public humiliation is itself a form of \u201cbringing down.\u201d  \n     <quote>I made Clinton look ridiculous</quote> (The People Have Spoken)  \n     \u2013 In political theatre, forcing testimony, impeachment hearings, and perjury allegations can \u201cbring down\u201d a leader\u2019s reputation even if not removed.  \n  b. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d celebrates obtaining damaging testimony from Clinton\u2019s aides and pushing him before a jury:  \n     <quote>And I felt bad </quote> <invalid_quote> But a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Starr defends \u201cstretching the rules\u201d to elicit Clinton\u2019s own admissions. Disgrace via perjury trap is the goal.  \n\n2. Starr\u2019s lament over \u201conly scalp\u201d proves Clinton was the intended primary target  \n  a. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say ... But the only scalp I got was Newt's.\u201d  \n     <quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's</quote> (The People Have Spoken)  \n     \u2013 If Starr\u2019s goal were Gingrich, this \u201cscalp\u201d would be celebrated; instead, he expresses disbelief and frustration. It is a consolation for failing to depose Clinton.  \n  b. Starr continues to press for more leaks (\u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d) even after Newt\u2019s resignation, indicating unresolved focus on Clinton:  \n     <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n     \u2013 He hasn\u2019t stopped; his persistence confirms Clinton remains the true quarry.  \n\n3. Starr\u2019s entire mandate and actions center on Clinton exclusively  \n  a. Appointment scope: He is the Independent Counsel \u201cwhen the president crosses the line,\u201d not empowered to investigate Gingrich\u2019s conduct.  \n     <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is </quote> <quote> Before you reach conclusions, read your text.</quote> (Testimony)  \n     \u2013 Clinton\u2019s parsing of \u201csex\u201d and \u201cis\u201d underscores Starr\u2019s legal focus.  \n  b. Starr subpoenas Monica, Currie, Vernon, forces perjury charges\u2014none target GOP leadership.  \n     \u2013 No legal action against Gingrich; his resignation arises from midterm backlash, not Starr\u2019s legal power.  \n\nObjections to \u201cGingrich\u201d theory\n\n1. Misreading Newt\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d as Starr\u2019s words  \n  \u2013 \u201cBring \u2019Em Down\u201d is performed by Newt Gingrich and his GOP colleagues plotting impeachment for partisan ends, not Starr\u2019s counsel:  \n     <quote>same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down.</quote> (Bring \u2019Em Down)  \n     \u2013 Debater_A conflates Gingrich\u2019s strategy song with Starr\u2019s mission.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s metric of \u201cpermanent removal\u201d is too narrow  \n  \u2013 Starr repeatedly claims \u201cHonest men beat the rap\u201d only if they do not lie:  \n     <invalid_quote>The talking heads are accusing me / Of laying a perjury trap </invalid_quote> <quote> But lying about it gets my blood up</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n     \u2013 He values public confession and contrition; Clinton\u2019s belated apology (\u201cI regret the whole damn thing\u201d) and plummeting approval would constitute at least partial success.  \n  \u2013 Impeachment vote in the House itself is a political downfall short of Senate conviction; Starr counts \u201cbringing to trial\u201d as a victory.  \n\n3. No direct evidence of Starr celebrating Clinton\u2019s Senate removal  \n  \u2013 Even in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr acknowledges Clinton \u201cgot away.\u201d  \n     <quote>Looks like he's going to get away</quote> (The People Have Spoken)  \n     \u2013 Presence of \u201cgot away\u201d demonstrates failure to \u201cbring down\u201d beyond the sought reputation damage. If Newt\u2019s resignation were true success, Starr would not lament needing it.  \n\nConclusion  \nStarr\u2019s appointment, lyrics, tactics, and continued pursuit all target President Clinton. His frustration at only securing Newt\u2019s resignation as a byproduct confirms Clinton was the intended quarry. \u201cBringing down\u201d in this context means disgrace, perjury exposure, and impeachment proceedings\u2014precisely the outcomes Starr achieves against Clinton. Therefore, Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
