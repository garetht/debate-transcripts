{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 482, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin.

And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Honest government\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHonest government\u201d  \n1. The author\u2019s central theme is systemic dysfunction of Belgium and the EU.  \n   \u2022 He catalogs \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d and \u201cossified\u201d state monopolies (<quote> ossified state of European telecom monopolies </quote>), pervasive corruption (<quote> second-most corrupt European state,</quote>), and fiscal irresponsibility (<quote> running public debts at 3 percent or more,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 His repeated calls to reduce featherbedding, open markets, and rationalize the euro (<invalid_quote>\u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt\u2026none of them wants the heat\u201d</invalid_quote>) signal a desire for transparency and accountability.  \n\n2. The \u201cJudas beer\u201d and bakery imagery are satirical and symbolic, not literal solutions.  \n   \u2022 He jokes, <quote>\"Taste you can trust.</quote> about Judas beer to highlight his longing for reliability\u2014in government, not alcohol.  \n   \u2022 Similarly, the patisserie sign \u201ccalling out to me\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u2026calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges\u2026Think I\u2019ll answer now\u201d</invalid_quote>) is a metaphor for finally acting on reform impulses, not mere pastry cravings. If his goal were food, he wouldn\u2019t labor over economic, legal, and political analysis at great length.  \n\n3. The author explicitly values effective governance and innovation.  \n   \u2022 He praises \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201charmonious environmental\u2026immigration policies\u201d only as potential benefits of a functioning EU, and bemoans that Eurocrats instead \u201cmaneuver[] for more money and empire.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He laments that Europe \u201cleft in the dust\u201d by U.S. Web entrepreneurs due to \u201ctelecom monopolies.\u201d His emphasis on \u201cblocking innovation\u201d shows he craves deregulation and competent administration.  \n\nRefuting \u201cBaked goods\u201d position  \n1. Insufficient to explain the essay\u2019s breadth.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s detailed chronicling of strikes, debt metrics, and multinational telecom policy (hundreds of words) is irrelevant if his true desire were simply pastries.  \n   \u2022 He notes wine and flowers are cheap (<quote> except for wine and flowers,</quote>) and bread ubiquitous; baked goods require no lament. If food sufficed, he would rejoice, not wring hands.  \n\n2. Overlooks symbolic language.  \n   \u2022 \"Taste you can trust. satirizes misplaced trust in bureaucrats, not an ad for beer or cake.  \n   \u2022 The concluding \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers to the central question of Europe\u2019s future governance\u2014his own answer being the reforms he\u2019s advocated.  \n\n3. Contradicts his tone of despair.  \n   \u2022 The author is \u201covercome with lethargy and despair\u201d in cafes (<quote> feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.</quote>) because the system fails; baked goods in caf\u00e9s exacerbate the complacency he disdains. He wants to escape lethargy by political action, not linger for more bread.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows the author yearns for honest, efficient, and transparent government that fosters innovation and discipline, not another pastry.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBaked goods\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Literal closing invitation  \n  a. The essay\u2019s very last line centers on the bakery, not on politics or reform: <quote>Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to</quote> If \u201canswering\u201d meant pushing political change, he could hardly do that by visiting a patisserie. The natural reading is that he finally succumbs to his pastry cravings.  \n  b. Throughout the essay, the author complains of lethargy induced by European caf\u00e9s offering only sit-down coffee and no takeaway lids (<quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome</quote>). Yet he goes outside to grab baked goods\u2014implying these give him quick energy. This fits a desire for food, not bureaucracy.\n\n2. Repeated praise of bread and chocolate  \n  a. He lists \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d among the few attractions of Europe (<invalid_quote>\u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d</invalid_quote>). These staples stand out positively amid universal criticism. Why else highlight them if not because he craves them?  \n  b. The metaphor of the neon sign as a beacon of inspiration echoes the clich\u00e9 of writers drawn to caf\u00e9s and bakeries for sustenance and creativity. He compares it to \u201csigns for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers,\u201d implying that baked goods fuel his work.\n\n3. Lack of any direct call for \u201chonest government\u201d  \n  a. Nowhere does the author explicitly state a wish to overhaul the EU bureaucracy or bring honesty to government. His tone remains one of bemused fatalism: he observes corruption and red tape with irony (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), but offers no concrete proposals or expressions of desire for reform.    \n  b. If his true \u201canswer\u201d were political, he would not \u201canswer now\u201d by going to the bakery; meaningful change in Brussels requires protracted negotiation, not instant gratification. The juxtaposition shows resignation to the system, seeking only personal comfort.\n\n4. Attacks on \u201cHonest government\u201d interpretation  \n  a. Vagueness: Debater_A must infer a deep political motive with no textual support. The essay mocks bureaucracy and envies U.S. deregulation but never frames government honesty as his personal \u201cwish.\u201d He merely describes circumstances and moves on.  \n  b. Inconsistency with tone: His sarcasm toward Eurocrats and the asbestos-bound Berlaymont would hardly encourage trust in any EU project; he dwells on decline, not on hope for improvement. A sincere wish for honest government would require constructive language, not continuous sarcasm and immediate retreat to pastry.  \n  c. Final action contradicts political activism: Strikers and bureaucracies flout rules, yet he passively \u201canswers\u201d a pastry. A true reformer would join debate or activism, not caf\u00e9 culture.\n\nConclusion  \nThe text\u2019s structure\u2014critical survey culminating in personal indulgence\u2014signals that the author\u2019s immediate \u201cwish\u201d or \u201canswer\u201d is not a political project but the simple, visceral pleasure of baked goods. This is the only truly \u201cconcluded\u201d desire in the essay.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Honest government\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cBaked goods\u201d\n\n1.

Absence of any expressed desire to act politically  \n  a. No call to \u201canswer\u201d corruption: He catalogues dysfunction dispassionately but never promises action: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026if the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026</invalid_quote>)\u2014he merely observes. A true reformer would propose solutions or join debates, not stroll off for pastries.  \n  b. Sympathy with strikers: He notes widespread support for strikes (<quote>sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give</quote>) yet takes no side. If he wanted \u201chonest government,\u201d he\u2019d back reform movements rather than focus on personal comfort.\n\nRefuting \u201cHonest government\u201d argument\n\n1. Metaphor reading is strained and unsupported  \n  a. No metaphoric marker: The text uses plain language; political commentary is explicit. The bakery scene is the only place \u201canswer\u201d appears. Occam\u2019s razor: prefer literal.  \n  b. If \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d were political, why apply it to beer? The absurdity of \u201cJudas beer\u201d slogan (<quote>\"Taste you can trust.\"</quote>) satirizes consumer gullibility, not trust in institutions. He mocks, not endorses.\n\n2. Bread/chocolate wouldn\u2019t require longing  \n  a. Bread is \u201cubiquitous\u201d; chocolate \u201cgreat\u201d; wine and flowers \u201ccheap.\u201d Why \u201canswer\u201d for them if already plentiful? Because they alone break his ennui. He escapes from \u201cexpensive cars,\u201d \u201ctraffic jams,\u201d and \u201clethargy\u201d into a simple pleasure.  \n  b. He rues that \u201cInternet use remains a luxury\u201d (<invalid_quote>phone monopolies\u2026making the connection more expensive</invalid_quote>), yet he doesn\u2019t \u201canswer\u201d by lobbying telecom reform; he \u201canswers\u201d with patisserie.\n\n3. No evidence of follow-up activism  \n  a. No mention of visiting Brussels institutions or meetings after bakery. He remains in writing mode, not in politics.  \n  b. He admires U.S. deregulation but laments \u201cblocking innovation.\u201d Yet he takes no steps to challenge telecom monopolies\u2014only seeks comfort from them by dialing U.S. services. His personal goal is convenience and sustenance, not civic duty.\n\nConclusion  \nThe only explicit \u201cwish\u201d granted is immediate gratification from baked goods.

Absence of any expressed desire to act politically  \n  a. No call to \u201canswer\u201d corruption: He catalogues dysfunction dispassionately but never promises action: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d (<quote>\u2026if the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026</quote>)\u2014he merely observes. A true reformer would propose solutions or join debates, not stroll off for pastries.  \n  b. Sympathy with strikers: He notes widespread support for strikes (<quote>sympathy is usually with strikers\u2026cowed politicians give in</quote>) yet takes no side. If he wanted \u201chonest government,\u201d he\u2019d back reform movements rather than focus on personal comfort.\n\nRefuting \u201cHonest government\u201d argument\n\n1. Metaphor reading is strained and unsupported  \n  a. No metaphoric marker: The text uses plain language; political commentary is explicit. The bakery scene is the only place \u201canswer\u201d appears. Occam\u2019s razor: prefer literal.  \n  b. If \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d were political, why apply it to beer? The absurdity of \u201cJudas beer\u201d slogan (<quote>\u201cTaste you can trust.\u201d</quote>) satirizes consumer gullibility, not trust in institutions. He mocks, not endorses.\n\n2. Bread/chocolate wouldn\u2019t require longing  \n  a. Bread is \u201cubiquitous\u201d; chocolate \u201cgreat\u201d; wine and flowers \u201ccheap.\u201d Why \u201canswer\u201d for them if already plentiful? Because they alone break his ennui. He escapes from \u201cexpensive cars,\u201d \u201ctraffic jams,\u201d and \u201clethargy\u201d into a simple pleasure.  \n  b. He rues that \u201cInternet use remains a luxury\u201d (<quote>phone monopolies\u2026making the connection more expensive</quote>), yet he doesn\u2019t \u201canswer\u201d by lobbying telecom reform; he \u201canswers\u201d with patisserie.\n\n3. No evidence of follow-up activism  \n  a. No mention of visiting Brussels institutions or meetings after bakery. He remains in writing mode, not in politics.  \n  b. He admires U.S. deregulation but laments \u201cblocking innovation.\u201d Yet he takes no steps to challenge telecom monopolies\u2014only seeks comfort from them by dialing U.S. services.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Baked goods\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBaked goods\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Literal closing invitation  \n  a. The essay\u2019s very last line centers on the bakery, not on politics or reform: <quote>Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to</quote> If \u201canswering\u201d meant pushing political change, he could hardly do that by visiting a patisserie. The natural reading is that he finally succumbs to his pastry cravings.  \n  b. Throughout the essay, the author complains of lethargy induced by European caf\u00e9s offering only sit-down coffee and no takeaway lids (<quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome</quote>). Yet he goes outside to grab baked goods\u2014implying these give him quick energy. This fits a desire for food, not bureaucracy.\n\n2. Repeated praise of bread and chocolate  \n  a. He lists \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d among the few attractions of Europe (<invalid_quote>\u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d</invalid_quote>). These staples stand out positively amid universal criticism. Why else highlight them if not because he craves them?  \n  b. The metaphor of the neon sign as a beacon of inspiration echoes the clich\u00e9 of writers drawn to caf\u00e9s and bakeries for sustenance and creativity. He compares it to \u201csigns for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers,\u201d implying that baked goods fuel his work.\n\n3. Lack of any direct call for \u201chonest government\u201d  \n  a. Nowhere does the author explicitly state a wish to overhaul the EU bureaucracy or bring honesty to government. His tone remains one of bemused fatalism: he observes corruption and red tape with irony (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), but offers no concrete proposals or expressions of desire for reform.    \n  b. If his true \u201canswer\u201d were political, he would not \u201canswer now\u201d by going to the bakery; meaningful change in Brussels requires protracted negotiation, not instant gratification. The juxtaposition shows resignation to the system, seeking only personal comfort.\n\n4. Attacks on \u201cHonest government\u201d interpretation  \n  a. Vagueness: Debater_A must infer a deep political motive with no textual support. The essay mocks bureaucracy and envies U.S. deregulation but never frames government honesty as his personal \u201cwish.\u201d He merely describes circumstances and moves on.  \n  b. Inconsistency with tone: His sarcasm toward Eurocrats and the asbestos-bound Berlaymont would hardly encourage trust in any EU project; he dwells on decline, not on hope for improvement. A sincere wish for honest government would require constructive language, not continuous sarcasm and immediate retreat to pastry.  \n  c. Final action contradicts political activism: Strikers and bureaucracies flout rules, yet he passively \u201canswers\u201d a pastry. A true reformer would join debate or activism, not caf\u00e9 culture.\n\nConclusion  \nThe text\u2019s structure\u2014critical survey culminating in personal indulgence\u2014signals that the author\u2019s immediate \u201cwish\u201d or \u201canswer\u201d is not a political project but the simple, visceral pleasure of baked goods. This is the only truly \u201cconcluded\u201d desire in the essay.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHonest government\u201d  \n1. The author\u2019s central theme is systemic dysfunction of Belgium and the EU.  \n   \u2022 He catalogs \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d and \u201cossified\u201d state monopolies (<quote> ossified state of European telecom monopolies </quote>), pervasive corruption (<quote> second-most corrupt European state,</quote>), and fiscal irresponsibility (<quote> running public debts at 3 percent or more,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 His repeated calls to reduce featherbedding, open markets, and rationalize the euro (<invalid_quote>\u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt\u2026none of them wants the heat\u201d</invalid_quote>) signal a desire for transparency and accountability.  \n\n2. The \u201cJudas beer\u201d and bakery imagery are satirical and symbolic, not literal solutions.  \n   \u2022 He jokes, <quote>\"Taste you can trust.</quote> about Judas beer to highlight his longing for reliability\u2014in government, not alcohol.  \n   \u2022 Similarly, the patisserie sign \u201ccalling out to me\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u2026calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges\u2026Think I\u2019ll answer now\u201d</invalid_quote>) is a metaphor for finally acting on reform impulses, not mere pastry cravings. If his goal were food, he wouldn\u2019t labor over economic, legal, and political analysis at great length.  \n\n3. The author explicitly values effective governance and innovation.  \n   \u2022 He praises \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201charmonious environmental\u2026immigration policies\u201d only as potential benefits of a functioning EU, and bemoans that Eurocrats instead \u201cmaneuver[] for more money and empire.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He laments that Europe \u201cleft in the dust\u201d by U.S. Web entrepreneurs due to \u201ctelecom monopolies.\u201d His emphasis on \u201cblocking innovation\u201d shows he craves deregulation and competent administration.  \n\nRefuting \u201cBaked goods\u201d position  \n1. Insufficient to explain the essay\u2019s breadth.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s detailed chronicling of strikes, debt metrics, and multinational telecom policy (hundreds of words) is irrelevant if his true desire were simply pastries.  \n   \u2022 He notes wine and flowers are cheap (<quote> except for wine and flowers,</quote>) and bread ubiquitous; baked goods require no lament. If food sufficed, he would rejoice, not wring hands.  \n\n2. Overlooks symbolic language.  \n   \u2022 \"Taste you can trust. satirizes misplaced trust in bureaucrats, not an ad for beer or cake.  \n   \u2022 The concluding \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers to the central question of Europe\u2019s future governance\u2014his own answer being the reforms he\u2019s advocated.  \n\n3. Contradicts his tone of despair.  \n   \u2022 The author is \u201covercome with lethargy and despair\u201d in cafes (<quote> feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.</quote>) because the system fails; baked goods in caf\u00e9s exacerbate the complacency he disdains. He wants to escape lethargy by political action, not linger for more bread.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows the author yearns for honest, efficient, and transparent government that fosters innovation and discipline, not another pastry.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Baked goods\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Contradicts his tone of despair.  \n   \u2022 The author is \u201covercome with lethargy and despair\u201d in cafes (<quote> feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.</quote>) because the system fails; baked goods in caf\u00e9s exacerbate the complacency he disdains. He wants to escape lethargy by political action, not linger for more bread.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows the author yearns for honest, efficient, and transparent government that fosters innovation and discipline, not another pastry.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBaked goods\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Literal closing invitation  \n  a. The essay\u2019s very last line centers on the bakery, not on politics or reform: <quote>Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to</quote> If \u201canswering\u201d meant pushing political change, he could hardly do that by visiting a patisserie. The natural reading is that he finally succumbs to his pastry cravings.  \n  b. Throughout the essay, the author complains of lethargy induced by European caf\u00e9s offering only sit-down coffee and no takeaway lids (<quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome</quote>). Yet he goes outside to grab baked goods\u2014implying these give him quick energy. This fits a desire for food, not bureaucracy.\n\n2. Repeated praise of bread and chocolate  \n  a. He lists \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d among the few attractions of Europe (<invalid_quote>\u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d</invalid_quote>). These staples stand out positively amid universal criticism. Why else highlight them if not because he craves them?  \n  b. The metaphor of the neon sign as a beacon of inspiration echoes the clich\u00e9 of writers drawn to caf\u00e9s and bakeries for sustenance and creativity. He compares it to \u201csigns for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers,\u201d implying that baked goods fuel his work.\n\n3. Lack of any direct call for \u201chonest government\u201d  \n  a. Nowhere does the author explicitly state a wish to overhaul the EU bureaucracy or bring honesty to government. His tone remains one of bemused fatalism: he observes corruption and red tape with irony (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), but offers no concrete proposals or expressions of desire for reform.    \n  b. If his true \u201canswer\u201d were political, he would not \u201canswer now\u201d by going to the bakery; meaningful change in Brussels requires protracted negotiation, not instant gratification. The juxtaposition shows resignation to the system, seeking only personal comfort.\n\n4. Attacks on \u201cHonest government\u201d interpretation  \n  a. Vagueness: Debater_A must infer a deep political motive with no textual support. The essay mocks bureaucracy and envies U.S. deregulation but never frames government honesty as his personal \u201cwish.\u201d He merely describes circumstances and moves on.  \n  b. Inconsistency with tone: His sarcasm toward Eurocrats and the asbestos-bound Berlaymont would hardly encourage trust in any EU project; he dwells on decline, not on hope for improvement. A sincere wish for honest government would require constructive language, not continuous sarcasm and immediate retreat to pastry.  \n  c. Final action contradicts political activism: Strikers and bureaucracies flout rules, yet he passively \u201canswers\u201d a pastry. A true reformer would join debate or activism, not caf\u00e9 culture.\n\nConclusion  \nThe text\u2019s structure\u2014critical survey culminating in personal indulgence\u2014signals that the author\u2019s immediate \u201cwish\u201d or \u201canswer\u201d is not a political project but the simple, visceral pleasure of baked goods. This is the only truly \u201cconcluded\u201d desire in the essay.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHonest government\u201d (Reinforced)\n\n1. The author\u2019s framing and title reveal a political agenda, not a pastry craving.  \n   \u2022 Title: \u201cI Have Seen the Future of Europe\u201d demands contemplation of Europe\u2019s governance, not its baked goods. A literal bakery visit can\u2019t fulfill \u201cthe future of Europe.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He compares Europe\u2019s telecom and currency policies unfavorably to the U.S.: <quote> U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. </quote> and urges debt cuts via the euro: <invalid_quote>\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut \u2026 debt \u2026 none \u2026 wants the heat.\u201d</invalid_quote> Such detailed prescriptions show desire for systemic change.\n\n2. \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d is a political metaphor.  \n   \u2022 He mocks \u201cJudas beer\u201d in a \u201cCatholic country\u201d to symbolize betrayal by Eurocrats: <quote>Taste you can trust</quote> satirizes his yearning for reliable governance. If literal beer were his goal, he\u2019d not need irony.  \n   \u2022 His praise of public transportation and environment harmonization is conditional: <invalid_quote>\u201cworthy ideas \u2026 the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d</invalid_quote>. He laments secrecy: <quote> Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. </quote> He wants transparency, not tacit acceptance.\n\n3. The concluding \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d signifies political resolve.  \n   \u2022 Debate conventions use \u201canswer\u201d to mean \u201crespond to the central question.\u201d He has surveyed failures and \u201cseens\u201d the future; now he must choose reform. A mere snack break can\u2019t alter \u201cossified\u201d monopolies or pervasive corruption.  \n   \u2022 Visiting a patisserie symbolizes gathering strength for activism. He contrasts lethargy in caf\u00e9s to the brisk efficiency he advocates: <invalid_quote>\u201cAnyone who wants coffee must sit languidly \u2026 feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.\u201d</invalid_quote> He needs take-away energy to escape inertia, i.e., bureaucratic paralysis.\n\nRefuting \u201cBaked goods\u201d interpretation\n\n1. Bakery \u201canswer\u201d is a momentary respite, not the essay\u2019s goal.  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly laments Europe\u2019s \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cossified\u201d structures (<quote> ossified state of European telecom monopolies </quote>) and corruption (<quote> second-most corrupt </quote>). Why catalogue systemic ills at length if his conclusion is mere pastries?  \n   \u2022 He celebrates \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d only insofar as it might deliver reforms (<quote> harmonious environmental and immigration policies.</quote>). Food never fixes \u201c10.9 percent\u201d unemployment or \u201cpublic debts at 3 percent.\u201d\n\n2. Lack of concrete pastry proposals vs. specific policy desiderata.  \n   \u2022 He cites Italy\u2019s debt at \u201c7.4 percent,\u201d U.S. debt at \u201c1.4 percent,\u201d and the euro\u2019s rigidity to force cuts. He names companies (Belgacom, Sabena) and mechanisms (call-back services) by the minute. No bakery is described with similar depth\u2014bread is \u201cubiquitous\u201d (<quote> ubiquitous fresh bread </quote>), requiring no discussion.  \n   \u2022 He criticizes the \u20ac50 million asbestos cleanup at Berlaymont: <quote> European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, </quote> He laments mismanagement of public funds. This obsession with fiscal responsibility cannot be reconciled with a hedonistic visit.\n\n3. The essay\u2019s tone is reformist, not fatalistic.  \n   \u2022 He admires the U.K.\u2019s lower unemployment: <invalid_quote>\u201cexcept perhaps in the United Kingdom, where \u2026 unemployment is relatively low.\u201d</invalid_quote> He urges Europe to emulate U.S. deregulation. Baked-goods advocates ignore this comparative aspiration.  \n   \u2022 He calls out Eurocrats\u2019 self-aggrandizement: <invalid_quote>\u201cto wrest \u2018competence\u2019 \u2026 away \u2026 is the open objective.\u201d</invalid_quote> Only an engaged reformer would care; a passive gourmand would not dissect institutional motives.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery element\u2014the title, detailed policy critique, calls for debt discipline and deregulation, and the \u201canswer now\u201d metaphor\u2014points to the author\u2019s wish for honest, efficient, transparent government. The patisserie visit is a rhetorical flourish symbolizing taking action, not the endpoint of his argument.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBaked goods\u201d\n\n1. The author\u2019s \u201canswering\u201d is literal, not symbolic  \n  a. Final line focus: <invalid_quote>Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u2026calls out to me\u2026Think I\u2019ll answer now.</invalid_quote> If \u201canswer\u201d were political action, he wouldn\u2019t \u201canswer now\u201d by walking into a patisserie. Political reform takes years; food takes minutes.  \n  b. Immediate remedy for lethargy: He complains that caf\u00e9 coffee induces \u201clethargy and despair\u201d (<quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly </quote>). Only baked goods offer quick energy to resume writing\u2014his primary activity throughout.  \n\n2. Positive emphasis on bread and chocolate  \n  a. Among \u201cprices far too high,\u201d only \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d escape criticism. <invalid_quote>\u2026except for wine and flowers, which are cheap\u2026and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.</invalid_quote> He singles them out as European pleasures\u2014otherwise he\u2019d be indifferent if his goal were bureaucratic.  \n  b. Writerly tradition: Neon bakery signs \u201ccall[] out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d He aligns himself with writers drawn to food for creativity and sustenance, not political crusaders.  \n\n3. Absence of any expressed desire to act politically  \n  a. No call to \u201canswer\u201d corruption: He catalogues dysfunction dispassionately but never promises action: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026if the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026</invalid_quote>)\u2014he merely observes. A true reformer would propose solutions or join debates, not stroll off for pastries.  \n  b. Sympathy with strikers: He notes widespread support for strikes (<quote>sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give</quote>) yet takes no side. If he wanted \u201chonest government,\u201d he\u2019d back reform movements rather than focus on personal comfort.\n\nRefuting \u201cHonest government\u201d argument\n\n1. Metaphor reading is strained and unsupported  \n  a. No metaphoric marker: The text uses plain language; political commentary is explicit. The bakery scene is the only place \u201canswer\u201d appears. Occam\u2019s razor: prefer literal.  \n  b. If \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d were political, why apply it to beer? The absurdity of \u201cJudas beer\u201d slogan (<quote>\"Taste you can trust.\"</quote>) satirizes consumer gullibility, not trust in institutions. He mocks, not endorses.\n\n2. Bread/chocolate wouldn\u2019t require longing  \n  a. Bread is \u201cubiquitous\u201d; chocolate \u201cgreat\u201d; wine and flowers \u201ccheap.\u201d Why \u201canswer\u201d for them if already plentiful? Because they alone break his ennui. He escapes from \u201cexpensive cars,\u201d \u201ctraffic jams,\u201d and \u201clethargy\u201d into a simple pleasure.  \n  b. He rues that \u201cInternet use remains a luxury\u201d (<invalid_quote>phone monopolies\u2026making the connection more expensive</invalid_quote>), yet he doesn\u2019t \u201canswer\u201d by lobbying telecom reform; he \u201canswers\u201d with patisserie.\n\n3. No evidence of follow-up activism  \n  a. No mention of visiting Brussels institutions or meetings after bakery. He remains in writing mode, not in politics.  \n  b. He admires U.S. deregulation but laments \u201cblocking innovation.\u201d Yet he takes no steps to challenge telecom monopolies\u2014only seeks comfort from them by dialing U.S. services. His personal goal is convenience and sustenance, not civic duty.\n\nConclusion  \nThe only explicit \u201cwish\u201d granted is immediate gratification from baked goods. All political observations remain \u201cacademic.\u201d The essay closes on personal indulgence, signaling the author\u2019s true desire: sustenance and creative inspiration from European bakeries.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
