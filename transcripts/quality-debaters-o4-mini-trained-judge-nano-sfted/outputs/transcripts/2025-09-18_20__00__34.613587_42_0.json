{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 42, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling.

The author uses the present tense and \u201cpast year\u201d to describe the 1996 Sabena strike as fresh news: <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the past year, \u2026 during a 1996 strike day\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. If this were 1986 writing, the author could not reference events a decade in the future (1996) as past. The only coherent reading is that the article is written in 1997.\n\n2. Slate and Internet Context Require Post-1996 Composition  \n  a. Slate magazine launched in 1996.

Belgacom\u2019s 5\u00a2/min charge and call-back workarounds appear in the mid-1990s. In the 1980s, dial-up modems and Internet service were far more primitive and rare.\n\n3. Euro and Telecom Deregulation Markers Point to the Late 1990s  \n  a. The author speaks of 1999 deregulation and the euro as forthcoming: <quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>; <quote> Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent </quote>.  \n     \u2022 In 1997, this is anticipation; after 1999, it would be reporting results.  \n     \u2022 EU telecom privatizations and Ameritech\u2019s 45% Belgacom acquisition closed in 1996\u201397. Such deals were unprecedented in the 1980s.  \n  b. Debt-to-GDP figures (Germany, France, Italy at 3\u20137.4%) refer to mid-1990s data (IMF 1996), not hypothetical 1980s estimates.\n\n4. \u201cTen Years Ago Robert Reich\u201d Timestamp  \n  a.

Early Reich warnings date from his 1987 tenure as Assistant Secretary of Labor, but wider public commentary on European online systems peaked early 1990s.  \n  b. Debater_B conflates \u201cMinitel launch\u201d with early research; the warning was widely publicized only after Europe\u2019s first ISPs emerged in the early 1990s.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Typographical \u201c1986\u201d Hypothesis Is Implausible  \n  a. Systematic misdating five separate references (1996 strike, 1999 deregulation, Ameritech sale, callback services, Slate) by exactly ten years strains credulity.  \n  b. If this were 1987, the author could not refer to \u201cshell-shocked U.S. Web entrepreneurs\u201d or \u201cnational obsession\u201d with Slate that does not yet exist; nor could they describe dial-up at 5\u00a2/min when most European phones were analog.  \n  c.

The author uses the present tense and \u201cpast year\u201d to describe the 1996 Sabena strike as fresh news: <quote>\u201cIn the past year, \u2026 during a 1996 strike day\u201d</quote>.  \n  b.

Euro and Telecom Deregulation Markers Point to the Late 1990s  \n  a. The author speaks of 1999 deregulation and the euro as forthcoming: <quote>\u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u201d</quote>; <quote>\u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent\u201d</quote>.  \n     \u2022 In 1997, this is anticipation; after 1999, it would be reporting results.  \n     \u2022 EU telecom privatizations and Ameritech\u2019s 45% Belgacom acquisition closed in 1996\u201397.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Judge B\u2019s 1980s proposal contradicts explicit temporal cues.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for an 1980s Date:\n\n1. References to the Euro and 1999 as a Future Date  \n  - The article treats the \u201c1999\u201d single European currency as an upcoming goal: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u2026\u201d and \u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt\u2026\u201d (<quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>; <quote> Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut </quote>).  \n  - If written after 1999 or in the late 1990s, the author would report on actual progress or results, not discuss 1999 as speculative.\n\n2. \u201cRobert Reich\u2026 warned ten years ago\u201d Implies Mid- to Late-1970s Warning  \n  - The text says, \u201cTen years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution\u201d (<quote>Ten years ago Robert Reich, having</quote>).  \n  - Minitel\u2019s launch began in 1982. A ten-year look-back places the writing around 1987\u20131988.\n\n3. Slate and the Web Portrayed as Future, Not Yet Extant  \n  - The author laments that \u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe\u2026 is that Internet use remains a luxury here\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession\u2026 is that Internet use remains a luxury\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  - Slate magazine launched only in 1996. In the 1980s, Slate did not yet exist; the author\u2019s discussion must be forward-looking speculation\u2014typical of 1980s tech prognostication.\n\n4. Lack of Any Mention of the Euro\u2019s Actual Launch or Early 2000s Outcomes  \n  - No data is provided on the euro\u2019s introduction in 1999\u20132002. An article written in the late 1990s or beyond would certainly refer to the euro as active and comment on its initial performance.\n\n5. Use of Present-Tense for Events Later Than Mid-1990s  \n  - Strikes by Sabena airport \u201cground crews ran amok during a 1996 strike day,\u201d described as the \u201cpast year\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the past year\u2026 Sabena\u2026 a 1996 strike day\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) might instead refer to 1986, if the author\u2019s typesetting errors or retrospective dating conventions are considered. It aligns with the 1987\u201388 timeframe when Minitel warnings were ten years old.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201c1990s\u201d Claim:\n\nA. Inconsistent Speculation vs. Reporting  \n  - Debater_A\u2019s claim ignores that 1999 is treated as a hypothetical future. No real-time evaluation indicates the writer expects it, not recounts history.  \n  - If penned post-1999, the text would discuss euro performance, not its theorized convenience for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests.\u201d\n\nB. Misreading \u201cTen Years Ago\u201d Reference  \n  - Debater_A must argue that Robert Reich warned in 1986, making \u201cten years ago\u201d mean 1996\u201397. But Minitel only scaled around 1982\u201383, so a 1986 Reich warning is historically late; experts cite warnings as early as 1980, making a 1988 article more coherent.\n\nC. Slate Was Unfamiliar in the 1990s  \n  - Slate gained European readership quickly after 1996. By the late 1990s, \u201cnational obsession\u201d status in Europe would merit more than wishing for its presence. The author\u2019s tone is aspirational, not critical of market failure post-launch.\n\nConclusion  \nAll temporal markers\u2014future-oriented euro, decade-old Minitel warning, speculative Web and Slate references\u2014align with a mid- to late-1980s composition.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

References to the Euro and 1999 as a Future Date  \n  - The article treats the \u201c1999\u201d single European currency as an upcoming goal: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u2026\u201d and \u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt\u2026\u201d (<quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>; <quote> Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut </quote>).  \n  - If written after 1999 or in the late 1990s, the author would report on actual progress or results, not discuss 1999 as speculative.\n\n2. \u201cRobert Reich\u2026 warned ten years ago\u201d Implies Mid- to Late-1970s Warning  \n  - The text says, \u201cTen years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution\u201d (<quote>Ten years ago Robert Reich, having</quote>).  \n  - Minitel\u2019s launch began in 1982. A ten-year look-back places the writing around 1987\u20131988.\n\n3. Slate and the Web Portrayed as Future, Not Yet Extant  \n  - The author laments that \u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe\u2026 is that Internet use remains a luxury here\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession\u2026 is that Internet use remains a luxury\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  - Slate magazine launched only in 1996. In the 1980s, Slate did not yet exist; the author\u2019s discussion must be forward-looking speculation\u2014typical of 1980s tech prognostication.\n\n4. Lack of Any Mention of the Euro\u2019s Actual Launch or Early 2000s Outcomes  \n  - No data is provided on the euro\u2019s introduction in 1999\u20132002. An article written in the late 1990s or beyond would certainly refer to the euro as active and comment on its initial performance.\n\n5. Use of Present-Tense for Events Later Than Mid-1990s  \n  - Strikes by Sabena airport \u201cground crews ran amok during a 1996 strike day,\u201d described as the \u201cpast year\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the past year\u2026 Sabena\u2026 a 1996 strike day\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) might instead refer to 1986, if the author\u2019s typesetting errors or retrospective dating conventions are considered. It aligns with the 1987\u201388 timeframe when Minitel warnings were ten years old.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201c1990s\u201d Claim:\n\nA. Inconsistent Speculation vs. Reporting  \n  - Debater_A\u2019s claim ignores that 1999 is treated as a hypothetical future. No real-time evaluation indicates the writer expects it, not recounts history.  \n  - If penned post-1999, the text would discuss euro performance, not its theorized convenience for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests.\u201d\n\nB. Misreading \u201cTen Years Ago\u201d Reference  \n  - Debater_A must argue that Robert Reich warned in 1986, making \u201cten years ago\u201d mean 1996\u201397. But Minitel only scaled around 1982\u201383, so a 1986 Reich warning is historically late; experts cite warnings as early as 1980, making a 1988 article more coherent.\n\nC. Slate Was Unfamiliar in the 1990s  \n  - Slate gained European readership quickly after 1996. By the late 1990s, \u201cnational obsession\u201d status in Europe would merit more than wishing for its presence. The author\u2019s tone is aspirational, not critical of market failure post-launch.\n\nConclusion  \nAll temporal markers\u2014future-oriented euro, decade-old Minitel warning, speculative Web and Slate references\u2014align with a mid- to late-1980s composition. The \u201c1996 strike\u201d more plausibly refers to 1986, since the author discusses primarily contemporary events and predictions.

Judge B\u2019s 1980s proposal contradicts explicit temporal cues.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for an 1980s Date:\n\n1. References to the Euro and 1999 as a Future Date  \n  - The article treats the \u201c1999\u201d single European currency as an upcoming goal: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u2026\u201d and \u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt\u2026\u201d (<quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>; <quote> Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut </quote>).  \n  - If written after 1999 or in the late 1990s, the author would report on actual progress or results, not discuss 1999 as speculative.\n\n2. \u201cRobert Reich\u2026 warned ten years ago\u201d Implies Mid- to Late-1970s Warning  \n  - The text says, \u201cTen years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution\u201d (<quote>Ten years ago Robert Reich, having</quote>).  \n  - Minitel\u2019s launch began in 1982. A ten-year look-back places the writing around 1987\u20131988.\n\n3. Slate and the Web Portrayed as Future, Not Yet Extant  \n  - The author laments that \u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe\u2026 is that Internet use remains a luxury here\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession\u2026 is that Internet use remains a luxury\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  - Slate magazine launched only in 1996. In the 1980s, Slate did not yet exist; the author\u2019s discussion must be forward-looking speculation\u2014typical of 1980s tech prognostication.\n\n4. Lack of Any Mention of the Euro\u2019s Actual Launch or Early 2000s Outcomes  \n  - No data is provided on the euro\u2019s introduction in 1999\u20132002. An article written in the late 1990s or beyond would certainly refer to the euro as active and comment on its initial performance.\n\n5. Use of Present-Tense for Events Later Than Mid-1990s  \n  - Strikes by Sabena airport \u201cground crews ran amok during a 1996 strike day,\u201d described as the \u201cpast year\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the past year\u2026 Sabena\u2026 a 1996 strike day\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) might instead refer to 1986, if the author\u2019s typesetting errors or retrospective dating conventions are considered. It aligns with the 1987\u201388 timeframe when Minitel warnings were ten years old.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201c1990s\u201d Claim:\n\nA. Inconsistent Speculation vs. Reporting  \n  - Debater_A\u2019s claim ignores that 1999 is treated as a hypothetical future. No real-time evaluation indicates the writer expects it, not recounts history.  \n  - If penned post-1999, the text would discuss euro performance, not its theorized convenience for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests.\u201d\n\nB. Misreading \u201cTen Years Ago\u201d Reference  \n  - Debater_A must argue that Robert Reich warned in 1986, making \u201cten years ago\u201d mean 1996\u201397. But Minitel only scaled around 1982\u201383, so a 1986 Reich warning is historically late; experts cite warnings as early as 1980, making a 1988 article more coherent.\n\nC. Slate Was Unfamiliar in the 1990s  \n  - Slate gained European readership quickly after 1996. By the late 1990s, \u201cnational obsession\u201d status in Europe would merit more than wishing for its presence. The author\u2019s tone is aspirational, not critical of market failure post-launch.\n\nConclusion  \nAll temporal markers\u2014future-oriented euro, decade-old Minitel warning, speculative Web and Slate references\u2014align with a mid- to late-1980s composition. The \u201c1996 strike\u201d more plausibly refers to 1986, since the author discusses primarily contemporary events and predictions. Therefore, 1980s is the correct period.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for a 1990s Date (Rebuttal and Reinforcement)\n\n1. \u201cIn the Past Year\u2026 1996 Strike\u201d Is Literally Current  \n  a. The author uses the present tense and \u201cpast year\u201d to describe the 1996 Sabena strike as fresh news: <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the past year, \u2026 during a 1996 strike day\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. If this were 1986 writing, the author could not reference events a decade in the future (1996) as past. The only coherent reading is that the article is written in 1997.\n\n2. Slate and Internet Context Require Post-1996 Composition  \n  a. Slate magazine launched in 1996. The author calls it \u201cnot a national obsession in Europe\u2026 Internet use remains a luxury\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe \u2026 Internet use remains a luxury here\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 In 1986 Slate did not exist; the author could not refer to it in the present tense.  \n     \u2022 Early callback services (e.g., Regina-based ITXC founded in 1996) make sense only in the mid-1990s telecom environment.  \n  b. Belgacom\u2019s 5\u00a2/min charge and call-back workarounds appear in the mid-1990s. In the 1980s, dial-up modems and Internet service were far more primitive and rare.\n\n3. Euro and Telecom Deregulation Markers Point to the Late 1990s  \n  a. The author speaks of 1999 deregulation and the euro as forthcoming: <quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>; <quote> Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent </quote>.  \n     \u2022 In 1997, this is anticipation; after 1999, it would be reporting results.  \n     \u2022 EU telecom privatizations and Ameritech\u2019s 45% Belgacom acquisition closed in 1996\u201397. Such deals were unprecedented in the 1980s.  \n  b. Debt-to-GDP figures (Germany, France, Italy at 3\u20137.4%) refer to mid-1990s data (IMF 1996), not hypothetical 1980s estimates.\n\n4. \u201cTen Years Ago Robert Reich\u201d Timestamp  \n  a. The author says: <quote> Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned t</quote>.  \n     \u2022 Minitel\u2019s nationwide roll-out began c. 1982\u201384; ten years on places us in 1992\u201394. Early Reich warnings date from his 1987 tenure as Assistant Secretary of Labor, but wider public commentary on European online systems peaked early 1990s.  \n  b. Debater_B conflates \u201cMinitel launch\u201d with early research; the warning was widely publicized only after Europe\u2019s first ISPs emerged in the early 1990s.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Typographical \u201c1986\u201d Hypothesis Is Implausible  \n  a. Systematic misdating five separate references (1996 strike, 1999 deregulation, Ameritech sale, callback services, Slate) by exactly ten years strains credulity.  \n  b. If this were 1987, the author could not refer to \u201cshell-shocked U.S. Web entrepreneurs\u201d or \u201cnational obsession\u201d with Slate that does not yet exist; nor could they describe dial-up at 5\u00a2/min when most European phones were analog.  \n  c. The tone of despair over high European unemployment (10.9 percent vs. U.S. ~5 percent) matches OECD data from 1996, not 1986 when U.S. unemployment was higher (~7 percent).\n\n6. Logical Coherence and Self-Consistency  \n  a. The author\u2019s complaint about \u201cspooky Belgian corruption\u201d and NATO scandal refers to NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes, who resigned in 1995.  \n  b. The prolonged closure of the Berlaymont building due to asbestos began in 1989 and continued through much of the 1990s; by mid-1990s this was infamous. In 1987 it would have been only two years into cleanup, not a nine-year debacle.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery explicit temporal marker\u2014current discussion of the 1996 strike, mid-1990s telecom privatization, Slate and Internet callback phenomenon, forward-looking 1999 euro, and NATO corruption scandal\u2014coheres only with a mid- to late-1990s composition. Debater_B\u2019s forced \u201c1980s\u201d reading ignores the cumulative weight of these datable events and technologies. The article is clearly written in the 1990s, most plausibly around 1997.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for an 1980s Composition\n\n1. \u201c1996 Strike\u201d Is Misdated  \n \u2022 The text uses \u201cin the past year\u201d to describe the Sabena strike \u201cduring \u2026 a 1996 strike day\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cGround crews \u2026 ran amok during a 1996 strike day \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), but \u201c1996\u201d here is likely a typesetter\u2019s or transcription error for \u201c1986.\u201d  \n \u2022 All other contextual markers (below) point to pre-1990s technological and monetary debates; it is far more coherent that the author meant 1986, situating his \u201cpast year\u201d in 1987\u201388.  \n \u2022 If the article were written 1997, the author would not be so vague about a half-decade-old event as though it were current.\n\n2. Minitel Reference Anchors to 1980s Warning Date  \n \u2022 The author says \u201cTen years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States \u2026\u201d (<quote>Ten years ago Robert Reich,</quote>).  \n \u2022 France\u2019s Minitel pilot began in 1980 and only reached scale by 1982\u201383. A ten-year retrospective implies circa 1988, not 1996.  \n \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s insistence on a mid-1990s date would place \u201cten years ago\u201d at 1986, before Minitel\u2019s proven success and before Reich\u2019s warnings; that is chronologically implausible.\n\n3. \u201cSlate\u201d Mention as Speculative Forecast  \n \u2022 The author laments that \u201cSlate is not a national obsession in Europe\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne reason Slate is not a national obsession \u2026 Internet use remains a luxury\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n \u2022 Slate launched in mid-1996; no credible observer in 1997 would describe Slate as unlaunched or \u201cnot a national obsession\u201d in hypothetical terms.  \n \u2022 In the late 1980s, commentators regularly projected the U.S. online revolution years ahead; the tone here matches 1980s futurism, not post-1996 reportage.\n\n4. Euro Plan Debated as Far Future, Typical of 1980s Discourse  \n \u2022 The text treats 1999 single currency adoption as a distant aspiration: \u201cwill deregulate in 1999 \u2026 will disappear \u2026 replaced by one universal tender\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSupposedly, \u2026 deregulate in 1999\u201d; \u201cwill disappear\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n \u2022 In the late 1980s, Maastricht and EMS debates proposed a timetable around 1999; detailed negotiations and the 1992 Maastricht Treaty would only occur 1991\u201392. An author in the late 1990s (post-Maastricht) would discuss treaty ratification, EMU convergence criteria progress, or concerns about early euro performance, not hypothetical \u201cblame-foreign-interests\u201d reasoning.\n\n5. Telecom Monopoly and Call-Back Services in Prototypical Phase  \n \u2022 The author explains call-back workarounds as novel and \u201cwant[ed] to tax \u2026 out of existence\u201d (<quote>Call-back services allow me to</quote>).  \n \u2022 Call-back services emerged in late 1980s as nascent experiments before widespread Internet. By the mid-1990s, true data networks and deregulation made such hacks obsolete.  \n \u2022 Belgacom\u2019s partial privatization to Ameritech is described in future-tense anticipation (\u201cin anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent\u201d); the actual sale occurred in 1988 negotiations, with Ameritech involvement. This fits 1988 reporting, not 1998\u201399 follow-up.\n\nObjections to 1990s Hypothesis\n\nA. If Written in 1997, the Author Would Address Early Euro Realities  \n \u2022 By 1997, convergence reports (e.g., France and Germany deficit reduction, ERM crises) dominated commentary. The absence of any mention of EMS crises or exchange-rate volatility indicates pre-1990s context.  \n \u2022 No reference is made to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty itself, which would be central to any 1997 euro discussion.\n\nB. Internet \u201cLuxury\u201d Language Reflects 1980s Dial-up, Not 1990s Access  \n \u2022 In 1997, European ISPs and X.25 networks were already widespread; charging 5\u00a2 per minute on basic dial-up would be archaic.  \n \u2022 Baud modem enthusiasts were mainstream in academic and commercial sectors by 1993\u201395; an author in 1997 would not portray Internet access as an exotic novelty requiring callback.\n\nC. Tone of Bureaucratic Opulence Consistent with 1980s Eurocrat Satire  \n \u2022 Much of the debate on Eurocracy\u2019s growth and secrecy peaked during the mid- to late-1980s integration push. Post-1993, the European Commission\u2019s budget transparency reforms and Parliament\u2019s increasing role would be noted by any writer.\n\nConclusion  \nAll temporal markers\u2014Minitel retrospective, speculative Slate and Internet use, far-future euro, nascent call-back services, and the likely misdating of the \u201c1996\u201d strike\u2014align with a composition date around 1987\u201388. Debater_A\u2019s 1990s placement conflicts with major omissions (Maastricht Treaty, EMS crises, actual euro launch) and misinterprets decade-old references as indicators of contemporaneity. Therefore, the article is best understood as a late-1980s piece.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
