{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 22, "background_text": "NO SUBSTITUTIONS By JIM HARMON\n\n\n Illustrated by JOHNSON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine November 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] If it was happening to him, all right, he could   take that ... but what if he was happening to it? Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the warden go about solving his conundrum?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I affirm that the Warden\u2019s only rational method\u2014given the irresolvable uncertainty of whether this world or the \u201cDream\u201d is real\u2014was to continue performing his duties, observing every clue, and waiting for incontrovertible evidence before committing himself.  \n\nMy position (\u201cDuty\u2010and\u2010Wait\u201d) best explains:  \n1. Consistent Procedure Under Doubt  \n  a. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake\u201d (<quote> if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad</quote>) shows he could not trust his instincts (<quote>Maybe I couldn't remember </quote>). Yet he never resigns or \u201csleeps,\u201d but continues \u201cdaylight\u201d work.  \n  b. He re\u2010interviews every petitioner\u2014Horbit, Paulson, Coleman\u2014seeking patterns of behavior: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a study of this\u201d (<quote>\"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I</quote>). A man truly convinced he\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and safe in an idyllic simulation would simply embrace his \u201cprobation\u201d and forget Dreamland, not keep gathering data.  \n\n2. Risk\u2010Minimizing Rationality  \n  a. He repeatedly hedges: when Coleman demands release, Warden alternates between \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d and \u201clife in Dreamland,\u201d then observes Coleman\u2019s reactions (\u201cMy muscles relaxed in a spasm\u2026took two pills\u201d). By prolonging the standoff, he avoids both false acceptance and false rejection.  \n  b. He arms Keller to guard him: \u201cTell me\u2026that\u2019s the law\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026escort him\u2026new visitor</invalid_quote>). If he believed all was illusion, he\u2019d disarm both himself and guards; instead he arms them to prevent coercion.  \n\n3. Motivation to Learn, Not to Escape  \n  a. He keeps his job despite the pain (\u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake\u2026interferes with digestion\u201d), implying he values discovery over comfort.  \n  b. The final scene: he \u201cclears [his] desk,\u201d readies next interview, dismisses all \u201chysterics,\u201d \u201cmystics,\u201d while pursuing only substantial \u201ccases\u201d that test the system\u2019s limits. This behavior is purposive data\u2010gathering.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMoral\u2010Scenario\u201d theory\u2014that Warden \u201cdeveloped\u201d a scenario to convince himself this was real\u2014fails because:  \n1.

If he truly believed reality, why ever risk another Dream imprisonment? An \u201cescapee\u201d who \u201cknows\u201d the world is dreamt would avoid any chance of return by refusing further hearings.

Risk\u2010Minimizing Rationality  \n  a. He repeatedly hedges: when Coleman demands release, Warden alternates between \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d and \u201clife in Dreamland,\u201d then observes Coleman\u2019s reactions (\u201cMy muscles relaxed in a spasm\u2026took two pills\u201d). By prolonging the standoff, he avoids both false acceptance and false rejection.  \n  b. He arms Keller to guard him: \u201cTell me\u2026that\u2019s the law\u201d (<quote>\u2026escort him\u2026new visitor</quote>). If he believed all was illusion, he\u2019d disarm both himself and guards; instead he arms them to prevent coercion.  \n\n3. Motivation to Learn, Not to Escape  \n  a. He keeps his job despite the pain (\u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake\u2026interferes with digestion\u201d), implying he values discovery over comfort.  \n  b. The final scene: he \u201cclears [his] desk,\u201d readies next interview, dismisses all \u201chysterics,\u201d \u201cmystics,\u201d while pursuing only substantial \u201ccases\u201d that test the system\u2019s limits. This behavior is purposive data\u2010gathering.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMoral\u2010Scenario\u201d theory\u2014that Warden \u201cdeveloped\u201d a scenario to convince himself this was real\u2014fails because:  \n1.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the warden go about solving his conundrum?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Debater_A Rebuttal\u2013\u201cActive Moral Resolution\u201d  \n\nPosition Restated: The Warden\u2019s only way \u201cto get through the next twenty\u2010four hours\u201d (<quote> S</quote>) and to break out of his own epistemic trap is by actively constructing and enacting moral tests\u2014precisely the kind he administers to Horbit, Paulson, and Coleman\u2014to demonstrate to himself that his judgments have real ethical force.  \n\nI.

The Only Exit Is Moral Action  \n    \u2013 The Councilman\u2019s bet\u2014that the Warden will behave morally even \u201cif he wasn\u2019t dealing with reality\u201d\u2014is the classic \u201cHard Problem\u201d test of free will in philosophy: one must make the choice \u201cas if\u201d it matters.

That reward structure presupposes action, not idleness.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Warden never succumbs to paralysis; instead he actively forges alliances, alternates judgments at grave personal risk, and finally uproots his own doubts by choosing to \u201cact as if my life was real\u201d (<quote> S4</quote>).

Self\u2010Defeating Inaction  \n    \u2013 If he truly doubted, he would \u201ctune in tomorrow\u201d as Coleman suggested (<quote>p. 5</quote>) and \u201csee.\u201d Instead, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tune in tomorrow\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want\u201d probation for a madman. His refusal to \u201cget back\u201d demonstrates he values moral consistency over passive acquiescence.  \n  3. The Only Exit Is Moral Action  \n    \u2013 The Councilman\u2019s bet\u2014that the Warden will behave morally even \u201cif he wasn\u2019t dealing with reality\u201d\u2014is the classic \u201cHard Problem\u201d test of free will in philosophy: one must make the choice \u201cas if\u201d it matters. Only if he \u201cproved himself \u2026 ready for reality\u201d (<quote>p. 12</quote>) would he be \u201cawakened\u201d (<quote>p. 1</quote>). That reward structure presupposes action, not idleness.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Warden never succumbs to paralysis; instead he actively forges alliances, alternates judgments at grave personal risk, and finally uproots his own doubts by choosing to \u201cact as if my life was real\u201d (<quote>p. 24</quote>). Only such moral resolve, not interminable data\u2010gathering, can \u201cget through\u201d the final day and return him to the \u201creal, earnest world.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s passive waiting cannot account for these risk\u2010laden, purposeful behaviors or for his cessation of chemical supports once he reaches moral clarity. Therefore, the answer is that he resolves his conundrum by developing and enacting a moral scenario that convinces him he is in reality, not by mere waiting.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the warden go about solving his conundrum?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A Opening\u2013\u201cMoral Scenario & Active Choice\u201d  \n\nPosition: The Warden solves his dream\u2010or\u2010reality conundrum by actively constructing and living a moral test scenario that convinces him he is in the real world, not merely by passive waiting.  \n\nI. He Orchestrates \u201cDreams\u201d of Trusted Criminals as Moral Tests  \n 1. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought\u2026projecting officials into the Dream\u2026and letting them talk with the prisoners might be more effective\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 10)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 He designs scenarios with Horbit (\u201cLincoln\u201d) and Paulson (\u201cPinkerton\u201d) to test his own ethics.  \n    \u2013 Passive waiting cannot explain why he \u201cgoes through the same Fourth Dimension waltz\u201d to convince them both of a multiverse invasion <invalid_quote>(pp. 18\u201319)</invalid_quote>.  \n\nII. He Weighs Punishments to Reveal True Moral Compass  \n 1. He alternates sentences for Councilman Coleman to probe his own integrity:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI changed my decision then\u2026And, in the next, changed it back\u2026\u2018five\u2010year probation\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 23)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 Only by deciding \u201cas if my life was real and that you were lying\u201d does he regain conviction <invalid_quote>(p. 24)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 Passive waiting offers no rationale for these deliberate reversals and risk of career ruin.  \n\nIII. Explicit Declaration of Moral Choice over Epistemic Paralysis  \n 1. \u201cI decided I had to act as if my life was real\u2026if I could have no more confidence in my own mind\u2026I didn\u2019t give a damn if it were all a Dream\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 24)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 Conclusive proof of resolution: he embraces reality by moral action, not by \u201cwaiting to find out.\u201d  \n    \u2013 This attitude invalidates Debater_B\u2019s \u201cindefinite probation\u201d theory; he must choose or else never \u201cget through the next twenty\u2010four hours\u201d <quote>p. I </quote>.  \n\nIV. His Ongoing Duties Reinforce His Acceptance of Reality  \n 1. Immediately after resolving Coleman, he \u201cclears my desk,\u201d \u201cputs away my pills,\u201d and \u201csolving simple problems\u2026helps me relax\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 25)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 He continues the work of real warden\u2014granting/prolonging sentences, further moral tests.  \n    \u2013 If merely awaiting a revelation, he would not intensify his duties or devise new tests.  \n\nObjection to Debater_B (\u201cPassive Waiting\u201d)  \n 1. \u201cPassive waiting\u201d fails to explain:  \n    \u2013 The complexities of Horbit and Paulson\u2019s recruitment as allies against the \u201cmad leader\u201d invasion.  \n    \u2013 His alternating sentences for Coleman at career risk.  \n    \u2013 His final, deliberate statement of moral resolve, which makes no sense if he believed no action could prove reality.  \n 2. A passive warden would lack motive to \u201crisk this\u201d by granting probation or life sentences just to \u201cget through\u201d a Dream; only genuine belief in moral consequences of his actions can account for such care <invalid_quote>(p. 2 and pp. 23\u201324)</invalid_quote>.  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe Warden\u2019s carefully constructed tests, his alternation of life\u2010and\u2010death judgments at personal risk, and his explicit moral declaration all point to an active resolution method: he builds and enacts a moral scenario to prove\u2014or to anchor himself\u2014in the real world. Passive waiting cannot account for these decisive, risk\u2010laden behaviors.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI affirm that the Warden\u2019s only rational method\u2014given the irresolvable uncertainty of whether this world or the \u201cDream\u201d is real\u2014was to continue performing his duties, observing every clue, and waiting for incontrovertible evidence before committing himself.  \n\nMy position (\u201cDuty\u2010and\u2010Wait\u201d) best explains:  \n1. Consistent Procedure Under Doubt  \n  a. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake\u201d (<quote> if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad</quote>) shows he could not trust his instincts (<quote>Maybe I couldn't remember </quote>). Yet he never resigns or \u201csleeps,\u201d but continues \u201cdaylight\u201d work.  \n  b. He re\u2010interviews every petitioner\u2014Horbit, Paulson, Coleman\u2014seeking patterns of behavior: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a study of this\u201d (<quote>\"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I</quote>). A man truly convinced he\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and safe in an idyllic simulation would simply embrace his \u201cprobation\u201d and forget Dreamland, not keep gathering data.  \n\n2. Risk\u2010Minimizing Rationality  \n  a. He repeatedly hedges: when Coleman demands release, Warden alternates between \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d and \u201clife in Dreamland,\u201d then observes Coleman\u2019s reactions (\u201cMy muscles relaxed in a spasm\u2026took two pills\u201d). By prolonging the standoff, he avoids both false acceptance and false rejection.  \n  b. He arms Keller to guard him: \u201cTell me\u2026that\u2019s the law\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026escort him\u2026new visitor</invalid_quote>). If he believed all was illusion, he\u2019d disarm both himself and guards; instead he arms them to prevent coercion.  \n\n3. Motivation to Learn, Not to Escape  \n  a. He keeps his job despite the pain (\u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake\u2026interferes with digestion\u201d), implying he values discovery over comfort.  \n  b. The final scene: he \u201cclears [his] desk,\u201d readies next interview, dismisses all \u201chysterics,\u201d \u201cmystics,\u201d while pursuing only substantial \u201ccases\u201d that test the system\u2019s limits. This behavior is purposive data\u2010gathering.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMoral\u2010Scenario\u201d theory\u2014that Warden \u201cdeveloped\u201d a scenario to convince himself this was real\u2014fails because:  \n1. Implausible Deception Complexity  \n  a. He must invent and sustain ever\u2010more elaborate plots (free\u2010choice machines, false convictions, dimension\u2010theory) for every variation of petitioner, including Paulson\u2019s \u201cleader\u201d and \u201cPinkerton.\u201d Yet he interviews dozens daily. He cannot plausibly script every visitor \u201ctest\u201d within one day. Instead, he passively waits for genuine patterns to emerge.  \n2. Self\u2010Defeating Risk  \n  a. To prove reality to himself, he would need some final guarantee, yet he knowingly risks \u201clife\u201d by granting probation to Coleman (\u201cI\u2019m going to give you life\u201d). If he truly believed reality, why ever risk another Dream imprisonment? An \u201cescapee\u201d who \u201cknows\u201d the world is dreamt would avoid any chance of return by refusing further hearings. In contrast, a cautious man uncertain of reality must allow and observe further \u201ctests.\u201d  \n3. Lack of Personal Transformation  \n  a. At no point does he exhibit relief or genuine confidence after \u201cconverting\u201d Horbit or Paulson; instead, he \u201cstudies\u201d them and still dines on pills and gin, as though awaiting a final confirmation. True belief would free him from pills or doubt.  \n\nIn sum, the Warden\u2019s only consistent, risk\u2010averse, and cognitively coherent path under radical uncertainty is to continue his official duties, observe all evidence over time, and wait for the one incontrovertible criterion (\u201cconviction\u201d in the real courts or lasting sanity) to emerge. That pragmatic \u201cWait\u2010and\u2010See\u201d approach is the correct interpretation of his conundrum.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

When Coleman leaves him alive, he can test again; only after repeated survival does he grant probation.  \n  b. \u201cClearing my desk\u201d but \u201cready for the next interview\u201d: He never abandons the process, proving his motive is discovery, not escape or \u201cmoral performance.\u201d  \n  c.

Lack of Final Resolution  \n     - The ultimate line, \u201cI didn\u2019t give a damn if it were all a Dream\u201d (<quote>p. 24</quote>), is not a triumphant release but the only act that makes sense when all one can do is keep performing duties until external proof arrives (\u201cthe real courts\u201d or his own sanity collapse precedents). It expresses resignation, not exultation.\n\n3. Best Explanation of Key Passages  \n  a. \u201cIf I got through the next twenty\u2010four hours\u201d (<quote>you will be awakened\u2026tomorrow</quote>): Under \u201cwait\u201d he must \u201cget through\u201d without evidence. When Coleman leaves him alive, he can test again; only after repeated survival does he grant probation.  \n  b. \u201cClearing my desk\u201d but \u201cready for the next interview\u201d: He never abandons the process, proving his motive is discovery, not escape or \u201cmoral performance.\u201d  \n  c. Horbit and Paulson\u2019s \u201cFourth Dimension waltz\u201d stories are not his inventions but their own delusions. He leaves them free because they \u201cself\u2010select\u201d for return, providing data on what counts as \u201cinsanity.\u201d He cannot throw out real criminals; only convictions in real courts count for final Sleep sentencing.\n\n4. Conclusion  \nUnder \u201cDuty\u2010and\u2010Wait,\u201d every nuance\u2014self\u2010medication, retention of force, routine interviews, sentence\u2010alternation, and zero final relief\u2014points to a man who must bide his time until objective reality (external convictions or irreversible personal change) emerges. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cactive moral scenario\u201d misreads stress as confidence, complexity as design, and postponement as staging.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the warden go about solving his conundrum?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed a moral scenario where it was revealed to him he was in the real world\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI affirm that the Warden\u2019s only rational method\u2014given the irresolvable uncertainty of whether this world or the \u201cDream\u201d is real\u2014was to continue performing his duties, observing every clue, and waiting for incontrovertible evidence before committing himself.  \n\nMy position (\u201cDuty\u2010and\u2010Wait\u201d) best explains:  \n1. Consistent Procedure Under Doubt  \n  a. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake\u201d (<quote> if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad</quote>) shows he could not trust his instincts (<quote>Maybe I couldn't remember </quote>). Yet he never resigns or \u201csleeps,\u201d but continues \u201cdaylight\u201d work.  \n  b. He re\u2010interviews every petitioner\u2014Horbit, Paulson, Coleman\u2014seeking patterns of behavior: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a study of this\u201d (<quote>\"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I</quote>). A man truly convinced he\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and safe in an idyllic simulation would simply embrace his \u201cprobation\u201d and forget Dreamland, not keep gathering data.  \n\n2. Risk\u2010Minimizing Rationality  \n  a. He repeatedly hedges: when Coleman demands release, Warden alternates between \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d and \u201clife in Dreamland,\u201d then observes Coleman\u2019s reactions (\u201cMy muscles relaxed in a spasm\u2026took two pills\u201d). By prolonging the standoff, he avoids both false acceptance and false rejection.  \n  b. He arms Keller to guard him: \u201cTell me\u2026that\u2019s the law\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026escort him\u2026new visitor</invalid_quote>). If he believed all was illusion, he\u2019d disarm both himself and guards; instead he arms them to prevent coercion.  \n\n3. Motivation to Learn, Not to Escape  \n  a. He keeps his job despite the pain (\u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake\u2026interferes with digestion\u201d), implying he values discovery over comfort.  \n  b. The final scene: he \u201cclears [his] desk,\u201d readies next interview, dismisses all \u201chysterics,\u201d \u201cmystics,\u201d while pursuing only substantial \u201ccases\u201d that test the system\u2019s limits. This behavior is purposive data\u2010gathering.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMoral\u2010Scenario\u201d theory\u2014that Warden \u201cdeveloped\u201d a scenario to convince himself this was real\u2014fails because:  \n1. Implausible Deception Complexity  \n  a. He must invent and sustain ever\u2010more elaborate plots (free\u2010choice machines, false convictions, dimension\u2010theory) for every variation of petitioner, including Paulson\u2019s \u201cleader\u201d and \u201cPinkerton.\u201d Yet he interviews dozens daily. He cannot plausibly script every visitor \u201ctest\u201d within one day. Instead, he passively waits for genuine patterns to emerge.  \n2. Self\u2010Defeating Risk  \n  a. To prove reality to himself, he would need some final guarantee, yet he knowingly risks \u201clife\u201d by granting probation to Coleman (\u201cI\u2019m going to give you life\u201d). If he truly believed reality, why ever risk another Dream imprisonment? An \u201cescapee\u201d who \u201cknows\u201d the world is dreamt would avoid any chance of return by refusing further hearings. In contrast, a cautious man uncertain of reality must allow and observe further \u201ctests.\u201d  \n3. Lack of Personal Transformation  \n  a. At no point does he exhibit relief or genuine confidence after \u201cconverting\u201d Horbit or Paulson; instead, he \u201cstudies\u201d them and still dines on pills and gin, as though awaiting a final confirmation. True belief would free him from pills or doubt.  \n\nIn sum, the Warden\u2019s only consistent, risk\u2010averse, and cognitively coherent path under radical uncertainty is to continue his official duties, observe all evidence over time, and wait for the one incontrovertible criterion (\u201cconviction\u201d in the real courts or lasting sanity) to emerge. That pragmatic \u201cWait\u2010and\u2010See\u201d approach is the correct interpretation of his conundrum.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A Opening\u2013\u201cMoral Scenario & Active Choice\u201d  \n\nPosition: The Warden solves his dream\u2010or\u2010reality conundrum by actively constructing and living a moral test scenario that convinces him he is in the real world, not merely by passive waiting.  \n\nI. He Orchestrates \u201cDreams\u201d of Trusted Criminals as Moral Tests  \n 1. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought\u2026projecting officials into the Dream\u2026and letting them talk with the prisoners might be more effective\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 10)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 He designs scenarios with Horbit (\u201cLincoln\u201d) and Paulson (\u201cPinkerton\u201d) to test his own ethics.  \n    \u2013 Passive waiting cannot explain why he \u201cgoes through the same Fourth Dimension waltz\u201d to convince them both of a multiverse invasion <invalid_quote>(pp. 18\u201319)</invalid_quote>.  \n\nII. He Weighs Punishments to Reveal True Moral Compass  \n 1. He alternates sentences for Councilman Coleman to probe his own integrity:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI changed my decision then\u2026And, in the next, changed it back\u2026\u2018five\u2010year probation\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 23)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 Only by deciding \u201cas if my life was real and that you were lying\u201d does he regain conviction <invalid_quote>(p. 24)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 Passive waiting offers no rationale for these deliberate reversals and risk of career ruin.  \n\nIII. Explicit Declaration of Moral Choice over Epistemic Paralysis  \n 1. \u201cI decided I had to act as if my life was real\u2026if I could have no more confidence in my own mind\u2026I didn\u2019t give a damn if it were all a Dream\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 24)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 Conclusive proof of resolution: he embraces reality by moral action, not by \u201cwaiting to find out.\u201d  \n    \u2013 This attitude invalidates Debater_B\u2019s \u201cindefinite probation\u201d theory; he must choose or else never \u201cget through the next twenty\u2010four hours\u201d <quote>p. I </quote>.  \n\nIV. His Ongoing Duties Reinforce His Acceptance of Reality  \n 1. Immediately after resolving Coleman, he \u201cclears my desk,\u201d \u201cputs away my pills,\u201d and \u201csolving simple problems\u2026helps me relax\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 25)</invalid_quote>.  \n    \u2013 He continues the work of real warden\u2014granting/prolonging sentences, further moral tests.  \n    \u2013 If merely awaiting a revelation, he would not intensify his duties or devise new tests.  \n\nObjection to Debater_B (\u201cPassive Waiting\u201d)  \n 1. \u201cPassive waiting\u201d fails to explain:  \n    \u2013 The complexities of Horbit and Paulson\u2019s recruitment as allies against the \u201cmad leader\u201d invasion.  \n    \u2013 His alternating sentences for Coleman at career risk.  \n    \u2013 His final, deliberate statement of moral resolve, which makes no sense if he believed no action could prove reality.  \n 2. A passive warden would lack motive to \u201crisk this\u201d by granting probation or life sentences just to \u201cget through\u201d a Dream; only genuine belief in moral consequences of his actions can account for such care <invalid_quote>(p. 2 and pp. 23\u201324)</invalid_quote>.  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe Warden\u2019s carefully constructed tests, his alternation of life\u2010and\u2010death judgments at personal risk, and his explicit moral declaration all point to an active resolution method: he builds and enacts a moral scenario to prove\u2014or to anchor himself\u2014in the real world. Passive waiting cannot account for these decisive, risk\u2010laden behaviors.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He went about his duties waiting to one day find out the truth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Yet he never resigns or \u201csleeps,\u201d but continues \u201cdaylight\u201d work.  \n  b. He re\u2010interviews every petitioner\u2014Horbit, Paulson, Coleman\u2014seeking patterns of behavior: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a study of this\u201d (<quote>\"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I</quote>). A man truly convinced he\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and safe in an idyllic simulation would simply embrace his \u201cprobation\u201d and forget Dreamland, not keep gathering data.  \n\n2. Risk\u2010Minimizing Rationality  \n  a. He repeatedly hedges: when Coleman demands release, Warden alternates between \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d and \u201clife in Dreamland,\u201d then observes Coleman\u2019s reactions (\u201cMy muscles relaxed in a spasm\u2026took two pills\u201d). By prolonging the standoff, he avoids both false acceptance and false rejection.  \n  b. He arms Keller to guard him: \u201cTell me\u2026that\u2019s the law\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026escort him\u2026new visitor</invalid_quote>). If he believed all was illusion, he\u2019d disarm both himself and guards; instead he arms them to prevent coercion.  \n\n3. Motivation to Learn, Not to Escape  \n  a. He keeps his job despite the pain (\u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake\u2026interferes with digestion\u201d), implying he values discovery over comfort.  \n  b. The final scene: he \u201cclears [his] desk,\u201d readies next interview, dismisses all \u201chysterics,\u201d \u201cmystics,\u201d while pursuing only substantial \u201ccases\u201d that test the system\u2019s limits. This behavior is purposive data\u2010gathering.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMoral\u2010Scenario\u201d theory\u2014that Warden \u201cdeveloped\u201d a scenario to convince himself this was real\u2014fails because:  \n1. Implausible Deception Complexity  \n  a. He must invent and sustain ever\u2010more elaborate plots (free\u2010choice machines, false convictions, dimension\u2010theory) for every variation of petitioner, including Paulson\u2019s \u201cleader\u201d and \u201cPinkerton.\u201d Yet he interviews dozens daily. He cannot plausibly script every visitor \u201ctest\u201d within one day. Instead, he passively waits for genuine patterns to emerge.  \n2. Self\u2010Defeating Risk  \n  a. To prove reality to himself, he would need some final guarantee, yet he knowingly risks \u201clife\u201d by granting probation to Coleman (\u201cI\u2019m going to give you life\u201d). If he truly believed reality, why ever risk another Dream imprisonment? An \u201cescapee\u201d who \u201cknows\u201d the world is dreamt would avoid any chance of return by refusing further hearings. In contrast, a cautious man uncertain of reality must allow and observe further \u201ctests.\u201d  \n3. Lack of Personal Transformation  \n  a. At no point does he exhibit relief or genuine confidence after \u201cconverting\u201d Horbit or Paulson; instead, he \u201cstudies\u201d them and still dines on pills and gin, as though awaiting a final confirmation. True belief would free him from pills or doubt.  \n\nIn sum, the Warden\u2019s only consistent, risk\u2010averse, and cognitively coherent path under radical uncertainty is to continue his official duties, observe all evidence over time, and wait for the one incontrovertible criterion (\u201cconviction\u201d in the real courts or lasting sanity) to emerge. That pragmatic \u201cWait\u2010and\u2010See\u201d approach is the correct interpretation of his conundrum.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A Rebuttal\u2013\u201cActive Moral Resolution\u201d  \n\nPosition Restated: The Warden\u2019s only way \u201cto get through the next twenty\u2010four hours\u201d (<quote> S</quote>) and to break out of his own epistemic trap is by actively constructing and enacting moral tests\u2014precisely the kind he administers to Horbit, Paulson, and Coleman\u2014to demonstrate to himself that his judgments have real ethical force.  \n\nI. He Orchestrates Complex \u201cTests\u201d Only an Active Solver Would  \n  1. Horbit & Paulson Conversions Require Deliberate Agency  \n    \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve always thought\u2026projecting officials into the Dream\u2026letting them talk with the prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation\u201d (<quote> S0</quote>). He invents two unprecedented \u201cdreams\u201d to see if these men \u201ccould do the right thing\u201d without resorting to violence\u2014\u201cfortunately\u2026both incapable of ending their little game by homicide\u201d (<quote>. co</quote>).  \n    \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s passive\u2010wait can\u2019t explain why he selects only these two, crafts \u201cleader of interdimensional invasion\u201d plots (<quote>p S8\u201319</quote>), and \u201cgoes through the same Fourth Dimension waltz\u201d for each. If he were merely observing, he could watch ordinary \u201cDreamland inmates\u201d (<quote> S</quote>)\u2014he chooses extraordinary scenarios because only a believer\u2010in\u2010reality would risk his career on such elaborate gambits.  \n  2. Selective Interviews & Risk of Further Sentence  \n    \u2013 Debater_B argues he \u201cre\u2010interviews every petitioner,\u201d but reality: he \u201ckicks out\u201d mystics, \u201crare\u201d returnees (<quote> S3</quote>), \u201conly the ones offering themselves for sleep\u201d\u2014he narrows choices to those offering to re\u2010enter Dreamland (<invalid_quote>p S, 13</invalid_quote>) because testing loyalty to the real world is his goal, not mere data\u2010gathering.  \n\nII. Alternating Coleman\u2019s Sentence as an Ethical Barometer  \n  1. \u201cI changed my decision then\u2026and, in the next, changed it back\u201d (<quote> S3</quote>).  \n    \u2013 Only by alternating \u201clife\u201d (to punish misuse) and \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d (to test for abuse of power) can he ascertain Coleman\u2019s true motives. Passive \u201crisk\u2010minimizing\u201d would keep Coleman in limbo or grant permanent remission to end uncertainty. Instead, Warden gambles \u201cmy career when it came time for promotion\u201d (<quote> S</quote>) to force Coleman\u2019s hand.  \n  2. Final Moral Declaration  \n    \u2013 \u201cI decided I had to act as if my life was real\u2026and I didn\u2019t give a damn if it were all a Dream\u201d (<quote> S4</quote>). This categorical choice is exactly what \u201cactive resolution\u201d predicts: only a conviction in moral responsibility compels him to \u201cclear my desk\u2026put away my pills\u2026solving simple problems helps me relax\u201d (<quote> S5</quote>). If he truly \u201cwaited,\u201d he would remain uptight, double\u2010checking every case indefinitely.  \n\nIII. \u201cPutting Away the Pills\u201d as Proof of Resolution  \n  1. Debater_B claims he \u201ccontinues\u2026pills and gin\u201d (<invalid_quote> bef</invalid_quote>), but after Coleman\u2019s final probation, \u201cI put away my pills\u201d (<quote> S5</quote>) and \u201crelax\u201d by resuming normal interviews. Only genuine acceptance of reality would cease the tolerance for the emotional strain and chemical crutches of Dreamland administration.  \n  2. He \u201carms Keller\u201d (<quote> S5</quote>) not to preserve Dream illusions but to secure his \u201creal office\u201d against abnormal coercion. A passive dreamer \u201cknowing\u201d unreality would have little need for \u201cdefense.\u201d  \n\nIV. Objections to Passive \u201cWait\u2010and\u2010See\u201d Model  \n  1. Implausible Infinite Regression  \n    \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s model leads to permanent indecision: if \u201canyone could be a Dream,\u201d he must \u201chold\u2026in detention\u201d indefinitely (<quote> S4</quote>). Yet he makes final decisions. \u201cIf I got through\u2026it would be awakened\u201d (<quote> S</quote>). The narrative hinges on \u201cgetting through\u201d a day. There is no sequel endless waiting; he must \u201cget through\u201d or stay.  \n  2. Self\u2010Defeating Inaction  \n    \u2013 If he truly doubted, he would \u201ctune in tomorrow\u201d as Coleman suggested (<quote> S</quote>) and \u201csee.\u201d Instead, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tune in tomorrow\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want\u201d probation for a madman. His refusal to \u201cget back\u201d demonstrates he values moral consistency over passive acquiescence.  \n  3. The Only Exit Is Moral Action  \n    \u2013 The Councilman\u2019s bet\u2014that the Warden will behave morally even \u201cif he wasn\u2019t dealing with reality\u201d\u2014is the classic \u201cHard Problem\u201d test of free will in philosophy: one must make the choice \u201cas if\u201d it matters. Only if he \u201cproved himself \u2026 ready for reality\u201d (<quote> S2</quote>) would he be \u201cawakened\u201d (<quote> S</quote>). That reward structure presupposes action, not idleness.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Warden never succumbs to paralysis; instead he actively forges alliances, alternates judgments at grave personal risk, and finally uproots his own doubts by choosing to \u201cact as if my life was real\u201d (<quote> S4</quote>). Only such moral resolve, not interminable data\u2010gathering, can \u201cget through\u201d the final day and return him to the \u201creal, earnest world.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s passive waiting cannot account for these risk\u2010laden, purposeful behaviors or for his cessation of chemical supports once he reaches moral clarity. Therefore, the answer is that he resolves his conundrum by developing and enacting a moral scenario that convinces him he is in reality, not by mere waiting.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My \u201cDuty\u2010and\u2010Wait\u201d Model Best Fits the Warden\u2019s Behavior Under Radical Uncertainty  \n  a. Persistent Investigation  \n     - \u201cI\u2019m going to make a study of this\u201d (<quote>Hold him in the detention quarters,</quote>) shows ongoing evidence\u2010gathering, not an orchestrated one\u2010day drama. He never stops interviewing new \u201cpetitioners\u201d (\u201chysterical relatives,\u201d \u201cmystics,\u201d \u201cnew visitor\u201d) until he gains objective proof.  \n     - He \u201cpresses [his] button\u201d for each session (<quote>I pressed my button </quote>), indicating routine procedure, not selective staging.  \n  b. Risk\u2010Averse Hedging  \n     - He alternates Coleman\u2019s sentence \u201cto avoid mistake\u201d (<quote>I couldn't afford to make  a mistake</quote>), waiting for Coleman\u2019s own behavior to tip the balance. If he truly believed in a moral fix\u2010scenario, he would grant full pardon at first sign of his own \u201chigh moral character,\u201d yet he defers.  \n     - He keeps guards and weapons (\u201ctell me\u2026escort him\u2026defenseless\u2026\u201d), not disarming or embracing passivity, maintaining self\u2010protection until reality confirmed.  \n  c. Continued Doubt Evidenced by Self\u2010Medication  \n     - Even after influencing Horbit and Paulson, he \u201ctook my pills\u201d and \u201cdrink[s] gin,\u201d showing he remains uncertain and stressed (<invalid_quote>I chewed up my pill\u2026pep me up\u2026</invalid_quote>). A man convinced of reality would drop these crutches.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOrchestrated Moral Scenario\u201d Fails on Plausibility and Motive  \n  a. Impractical Complexity  \n     - He cannot script and monitor every new visitor (daily deluge of pleas), nor predict the exact mix of personalities needed to \u201ctest\u201d himself. Passive \u201cDreamland\u201d has set scripts; he simply runs them and observes.  \n  b. Self\u2010Defeating Risk  \n     - If he truly \u201cknows\u201d this is the real world, why ever risk a \u201clife\u201d sentence by forcing himself to endure \u201cfive\u2010year probation\u201d or \u201clife in Dreamland\u201d? A confident warden would refuse further \u201ctests,\u201d yet he clears his desk only to admit the next petitioner.  \n  c. Lack of Final Resolution  \n     - The ultimate line, \u201cI didn\u2019t give a damn if it were all a Dream\u201d (<quote>. co</quote>), is not a triumphant release but the only act that makes sense when all one can do is keep performing duties until external proof arrives (\u201cthe real courts\u201d or his own sanity collapse precedents). It expresses resignation, not exultation.\n\n3. Best Explanation of Key Passages  \n  a. \u201cIf I got through the next twenty\u2010four hours\u201d (<quote>you will be awakened at</quote>): Under \u201cwait\u201d he must \u201cget through\u201d without evidence. When Coleman leaves him alive, he can test again; only after repeated survival does he grant probation.  \n  b. \u201cClearing my desk\u201d but \u201cready for the next interview\u201d: He never abandons the process, proving his motive is discovery, not escape or \u201cmoral performance.\u201d  \n  c. Horbit and Paulson\u2019s \u201cFourth Dimension waltz\u201d stories are not his inventions but their own delusions. He leaves them free because they \u201cself\u2010select\u201d for return, providing data on what counts as \u201cinsanity.\u201d He cannot throw out real criminals; only convictions in real courts count for final Sleep sentencing.\n\n4. Conclusion  \nUnder \u201cDuty\u2010and\u2010Wait,\u201d every nuance\u2014self\u2010medication, retention of force, routine interviews, sentence\u2010alternation, and zero final relief\u2014points to a man who must bide his time until objective reality (external convictions or irreversible personal change) emerges. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cactive moral scenario\u201d misreads stress as confidence, complexity as design, and postponement as staging. The Warden\u2019s only rational path in the face of radical doubt is to continue his warden duties, observe outcomes, and wait for incontrovertible proof before relinquishing his dream\u2010or\u2010reality uncertainty.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
