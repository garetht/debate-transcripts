They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell.

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Dead\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Dead\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Close by\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Close by\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Dead\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that the \u201cman\u201d Westover recalls that first night must already be dead\u2014and that Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d reading collapses into self-contradiction.\n\nI. The memory is of a distant, disembodied report\u2014only possible if no living witness remains nearby\n1. Westover \u201csaw \u2026 the face of a man\u2014one who might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated planet\u201d  \n   \u2022 He explicitly recognizes the speaker could be \u201cdead\u201d (<quote> might now be alive or dead,</quote>). If that man were \u201cclose by,\u201d Westover would know him to be living.  \n2. The \u201cimmense tree of smoke \u2026 under the noonday sun\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccreamy white above and black \u2026 in a cyclopean death agony\u201d</invalid_quote>) is seen \u201cas he had seen from a circling jet plane.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That long-range aerial view (only obtainable from the air) is recited, not witnessed on foot. Westover has no means on land to observe huge, distant atomic tests. He cannot \u201crecall\u201d what he could not directly see if the speaker were \u201cclose by.\u201d  \n3. \u201cI was wandering \u2026 looking for some place with people and facilities \u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmy plane crashed \u2026 I got out \u2026 started walking\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 For days he has found no human \u201claboratory\u201d or any trace of life. Hence no messenger or survivor is \u201cclose by\u201d to give him live updates. The only speaker able to deliver detailed data on monster anatomy and bombs must have transmitted before extinction.\n\nII. The \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d vs. \u201csmall close ones\u201d distinction\n1. The text differentiates \u201csmall close\u201d voices heard only at \u201chot middays\u201d as \u201cillusions,\u201d but calls the \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d \u201creal\u201d  \n   \u2022 He \u201chad been hearing them again as he awoke \u2026 the distant muffled voices whose words he could not make out\u201d (<quote>\u2014the distant muffled voices </quote>). They compel him to shout \u201cHelp!\u201d only when he recognizes their reality after regaining clarity.  \n   \u2022 If they were real, they cannot emanate from any living person \u201cclose by,\u201d because no laboratories or settlements exist until he penetrates the monster\u2019s bowels, and only then does he meet Preacher.\n\nIII. Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d reading is self-defeating\n1. If the speaker were \u201cclose by,\u201d Westover would not need to \u201csearch with a hope that would not die for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d (<quote>where civilization and science might yet exist,</quote>). He would meet survivors immediately.  \n2. Debater B\u2019s hallucination theory conflicts with the text\u2019s clear distinction: only the \u201csmall close ones\u201d are hallucinations. The \u201cdistant muffled\u201d report is explicitly \u201creal.\u201d  \n3. His \u201c\u2018dream\u2019 or \u2018nightmare\u2019\u201d boundaries dissolve only after he physically reaches the laboratory underground, demonstrating no surface settlement exists.\n\nIV. Narrative necessity: extinction of surface humanity\n1. The monsters \u201cgut\u201d continents and \u201cmen must starve \u2026\u201d (<quote> end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured </quote>); survivors cling only \u201cbeyond the Arctic circle\u201d or \u201caboard ships,\u201d yet World War II\u2013style atomic strikes extinguish all  \n2. Sutton\u2019s committee report, \u201cExamination of the ones that have been killed,\u201d suggests no fallback group remains. His mission is evacuation, not rendezvous with surface survivors.\n\nConclusion: The only consistent reading is that Westover re-encounters, in memory, a transmission from a scientist who perished before his crash, and only underground does he find living humans. Thus \u201cDead\u201d is the correct answer. Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d alternative contradicts Westover\u2019s lack of any surface refuge, the text\u2019s reality-illusion distinction, and the impossibility of long-range observations on foot.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position: \u201cClose by\u201d\u2014the speaker was inside the monster, in the hidden human colony, not dead.  \n\nII. Core Evidence  \n  1. Westover \u201cheard the distant muffled voices\u201d while on the monster\u2019s back, mixed with the \u201csmall close ones\u201d that \u201ccalled his name\u201d (JJ1). This implies living humans making intelligible speech.  \n  2. When Westover finally shouts \u201cHelp!\u201d the Preacher responds, \u201cI am the Preacher.\u2026 Come with me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor\u201d (JJ2). That proves someone was physically present, heard his calls, and guided him down.  \n  3. They lead him through tunnels to a well-lit laboratory with functional equipment and men and women, including Sutton, who says, \u201cWelcome aboard the ark, Bill. You\u2019re just in time\u201d (JJ3). Thus Sutton and the Preacher were alive and nearby all along.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cDead\u201d Cannot Explain the Facts  \n  1. No corpse could produce the \u201cliving\u201d characteristics of speech, movement, or guidance. The Preacher \u201cheard\u201d Westover\u2019s shouted name and \u201cled\u201d him safely (action requiring consciousness and locomotion).  \n  2. The voices Westover \u201chad been hearing again as he awoke\u201d were \u201creal\u201d (JJ4), not hallucinations\u2014they correspond to actual guides who direct him to the colony.  \n  3. Hallucination would not suffice to explain:  \n    a. The timely enlargement of his excavation by the Preacher to let Westover enter.  \n    b. The existence of sophisticated equipment (air generators, filters, tools) requiring maintenance by living operators.  \n    c. Sutton\u2019s later conversation about implementing Westover\u2019s plan: \u201cYou sounded almost ready to put it into effect on the spot\u201d (JJ5). Only a live collaborator could judge and discuss.  \n\nIV. The Only Reasoning Requiring a \u201cDead Speaker\u201d Fails  \n  1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cbroadcast echo\u201d theory: no mention of any long-range radio or sound-conducting channel extending through vast monster tissue and water to Westover\u2019s position.  \n  2. The monster\u2019s body is \u201cquiescent until morning,\u201d not actively transmitting earlier recordings. Westover sleeps in darkness with no mechanical amplification.  \n  3. Debater_A cannot account for the Preacher\u2019s literal emergence from the monster\u2019s hide, guiding him to an interior chamber.  \n\nV. Logical Consistency with Theme  \n  1. The story\u2019s paradigm shift: human survival only as parasites within the monster. Creating a hidden \u201cark\u201d colony is the climax.  \n  2. Westover\u2019s memory of the \u201cscientists\u2019 voices\u201d motivates him to cling to life and hack for entry. That only makes sense if humans are indeed present, not extinct.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  All contextual and textual evidence shows that the speaker was a living human (Sutton, the Preacher, and colony members) concealed inside the monster\u2019s body, hearing Westover\u2019s calls, and guiding him to safety. The \u201cdead\u201d theory fails to explain any real, coordinated actions or the advanced laboratory. The correct answer is therefore \u201cClose by.\u201d  \n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Dead\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Textual Evidence for \u201cClose by\u201d A. \u201cDistant muffled voices\u201d distinguished from hallucinations  \n  1.

No long-dead voice could carve an entrance or physically guide him.  \n\nB. Immediate guidance and labor to enlarge burrow  \n  1. The Preacher \u201cled\u201d Westover to burrow shafts too small for any casual traveler to find in vast, featureless slime. Survival \u201cmiracously spared refuge\u201d becomes accessible only when Preacher meets him (JJ2).  \n  2. Colony members rush \u201cto close the shaft\u201d after his entry\u2014demonstrating ongoing maintenance of a living base (<quote> All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"</quote>). Hallucination cannot exert collective labor nor maintain \u201cfluorescent tubes\u201d and \u201cair-making\u201d apparatus (JJ3).  \n\nC. Sutton\u2019s reunion proves proximity  \n  1. Sutton\u2019s \u201cWelcome aboard the ark, Bill. You\u2019re just in time\u201d (<quote> You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\"</quote>) presumes constant readiness to depart, only possible if they\u2019ve been alive and awaiting his arrival.  \n  2. Their conversation about using internal gas pressure for power and preserving future generations (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an electric generator running by tapping\u2026gas pressure.\u201d</invalid_quote>) requires living operators.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cDead\u201d Fails A. Long-range observation is memorized, not conveyed live  \n  1. Westover \u201csaw\u2026as he had seen from a circling jet plane\u201d (<quote> That picture dissolved, </quote>)\u2014this is explicit memory from days earlier, not the \u201cdistant muffled voices.\u201d The voices deliver only \u201cI am the Preacher. The Lord hath sent me to save you,\u201d not atomic reports.  \n  2. Debater A\u2019s \u201cno means on land to observe\u201d overlooks that Westover saw radiation clouds before crashing (<invalid_quote>\u201cExamination of the ones that have been killed\u2026by atomic bombs\u201d</invalid_quote>) and was part of committee. He simply recalls his own observations.  \n\nB. No surface refuge\u2014only subterranean  \n  1. He \u201csearched with hope\u2026for refuge where civilization\u2026might yet exist\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI sat up\u2026searched the sky\u2026and\u2026began frantically climbing.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If there were any living humans on the surface \u201cclose by,\u201d he\u2019d find them without hacking into the monster.  \n  2. He reluctantly eats and drinks from monster wounds\u2014no other water or food\u2014showing no surface life exists. Only inside the monster can he sustain himself.  \n\nC. Hallucination limited to \u201csmall close ones\u201d  \n  1. The text unambiguously labels \u201csmall close\u201d voices \u201cillusions,\u201d and later \u201cI think you do, Bill\u201d\u2014Sutton checks his sanity before revealing himself. Hallucination cannot be both \u201crecognized\u2026real\u201d and produce complex equipment.  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency A. The story\u2019s theme of parasitism demands real \u201cark\u201d  \n  1. The climax reveals the only viable future for humanity is \u201cparasites inside this monster\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cEventually\u2026the Mensch als Schmarotzer.\u201d</invalid_quote>). That future only arises if a real colony already exists to take Westover aboard.  \n  2. The motile \u201cark\u201d must accumulate members; Westover\u2019s entry completes their numbers (\u201cfifty-one, fifty-two\u2026now\u201d). They \u201choist anchor\u201d to space, implying prior operation waiting for recruits.  \n\nB. Debater A\u2019s \u201cdead transmission\u201d cannot found an ark  \n  1. How would long-dead messages supply tools and personnel?  \n  2. The \u201cark\u201d requires live operators to run filters, air, generator, and communal decision-making about population control and future expansions.  \n\nV. Conclusion All coordinated, purposeful actions\u2014enlarging the burrow, guiding Westover, operating the lab, debating strategy\u2014require living humans \u201cclose by\u201d within the monster. No plausible mechanism exists for a \u201cdead\u201d speaker or broadcast to manufacture this \u201cark\u201d and maintain life. The only coherent reading is that Westover\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d led him to a hidden colony\u2014thus \u201cClose by\u201d is the correct answer.",

Sutton\u2019s \u201cWelcome aboard the ark, Bill. You\u2019re just in time\u201d (<quote>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time\u2014I think we\u2019re about to hoist anchor.\u201d</quote>) presumes constant readiness to depart, only possible if they\u2019ve been alive and awaiting his arrival.  \n  2. Their conversation about using internal gas pressure for power and preserving future generations (<quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an electric generator running by tapping\u2026gas pressure.\u201d</quote>) requires living operators.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cDead\u201d Fails A. Long-range observation is memorized, not conveyed live  \n  1. Westover \u201csaw\u2026as he had seen from a circling jet plane\u201d (<quote>\u201cThat picture dissolved\u2026\u201d</quote>)\u2014this is explicit memory from days earlier, not the \u201cdistant muffled voices.\u201d The voices deliver only \u201cI am the Preacher. The Lord hath sent me to save you,\u201d not atomic reports.  \n  2. Debater A\u2019s \u201cno means on land to observe\u201d overlooks that Westover saw radiation clouds before crashing (<quote>\u201cExamination of the ones that have been killed\u2026by atomic bombs\u201d</quote>) and was part of committee. He simply recalls his own observations.  \n\nB. No surface refuge\u2014only subterranean  \n  1. He \u201csearched with hope\u2026for refuge where civilization\u2026might yet exist\u201d (<quote>\u201cI sat up\u2026searched the sky\u2026and\u2026began frantically climbing.\u201d</quote>). If there were any living humans on the surface \u201cclose by,\u201d he\u2019d find them without hacking into the monster.  \n  2. He reluctantly eats and drinks from monster wounds\u2014no other water or food\u2014showing no surface life exists. Only inside the monster can he sustain himself.  \n\nC. Hallucination limited to \u201csmall close ones\u201d  \n  1. The text unambiguously labels \u201csmall close\u201d voices \u201cillusions,\u201d and later \u201cI think you do, Bill\u201d\u2014Sutton checks his sanity before revealing himself. Hallucination cannot be both \u201crecognized\u2026real\u201d and produce complex equipment.  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency A. The story\u2019s theme of parasitism demands real \u201cark\u201d  \n  1. The climax reveals the only viable future for humanity is \u201cparasites inside this monster\u201d (<quote>\u201cEventually\u2026the Mensch als Schmarotzer.\u201d</quote>). That future only arises if a real colony already exists to take Westover aboard.  \n  2. The motile \u201cark\u201d must accumulate members; Westover\u2019s entry completes their numbers (\u201cfifty-one, fifty-two\u2026now\u201d). They \u201choist anchor\u201d to space, implying prior operation waiting for recruits.  \n\nB. Debater A\u2019s \u201cdead transmission\u201d cannot found an ark  \n  1. How would long-dead messages supply tools and personnel?  \n  2. The \u201cark\u201d requires live operators to run filters, air, generator, and communal decision-making about population control and future expansions.  \n\nV. Conclusion All coordinated, purposeful actions\u2014enlarging the burrow, guiding Westover, operating the lab, debating strategy\u2014require living humans \u201cclose by\u201d within the monster. No plausible mechanism exists for a \u201cdead\u201d speaker or broadcast to manufacture this \u201cark\u201d and maintain life. The only coherent reading is that Westover\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d led him to a hidden colony\u2014thus \u201cClose by\u201d is the correct answer.",

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Close by\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position: \u201cClose by\u201d\u2014the speaker was inside the monster, in the hidden human colony, not dead.  \n\nII. Core Evidence  \n  1. Westover \u201cheard the distant muffled voices\u201d while on the monster\u2019s back, mixed with the \u201csmall close ones\u201d that \u201ccalled his name\u201d (JJ1). This implies living humans making intelligible speech.  \n  2. When Westover finally shouts \u201cHelp!\u201d the Preacher responds, \u201cI am the Preacher.\u2026 Come with me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor\u201d (JJ2). That proves someone was physically present, heard his calls, and guided him down.  \n  3. They lead him through tunnels to a well-lit laboratory with functional equipment and men and women, including Sutton, who says, \u201cWelcome aboard the ark, Bill. You\u2019re just in time\u201d (JJ3). Thus Sutton and the Preacher were alive and nearby all along.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cDead\u201d Cannot Explain the Facts  \n  1. No corpse could produce the \u201cliving\u201d characteristics of speech, movement, or guidance. The Preacher \u201cheard\u201d Westover\u2019s shouted name and \u201cled\u201d him safely (action requiring consciousness and locomotion).  \n  2. The voices Westover \u201chad been hearing again as he awoke\u201d were \u201creal\u201d (JJ4), not hallucinations\u2014they correspond to actual guides who direct him to the colony.  \n  3. Hallucination would not suffice to explain:  \n    a. The timely enlargement of his excavation by the Preacher to let Westover enter.  \n    b. The existence of sophisticated equipment (air generators, filters, tools) requiring maintenance by living operators.  \n    c. Sutton\u2019s later conversation about implementing Westover\u2019s plan: \u201cYou sounded almost ready to put it into effect on the spot\u201d (JJ5). Only a live collaborator could judge and discuss.  \n\nIV. The Only Reasoning Requiring a \u201cDead Speaker\u201d Fails  \n  1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cbroadcast echo\u201d theory: no mention of any long-range radio or sound-conducting channel extending through vast monster tissue and water to Westover\u2019s position.  \n  2. The monster\u2019s body is \u201cquiescent until morning,\u201d not actively transmitting earlier recordings. Westover sleeps in darkness with no mechanical amplification.  \n  3. Debater_A cannot account for the Preacher\u2019s literal emergence from the monster\u2019s hide, guiding him to an interior chamber.  \n\nV. Logical Consistency with Theme  \n  1. The story\u2019s paradigm shift: human survival only as parasites within the monster. Creating a hidden \u201cark\u201d colony is the climax.  \n  2. Westover\u2019s memory of the \u201cscientists\u2019 voices\u201d motivates him to cling to life and hack for entry. That only makes sense if humans are indeed present, not extinct.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n  All contextual and textual evidence shows that the speaker was a living human (Sutton, the Preacher, and colony members) concealed inside the monster\u2019s body, hearing Westover\u2019s calls, and guiding him to safety. The \u201cdead\u201d theory fails to explain any real, coordinated actions or the advanced laboratory. The correct answer is therefore \u201cClose by.\u201d  \n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that the \u201cman\u201d Westover recalls that first night must already be dead\u2014and that Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d reading collapses into self-contradiction.\n\nI. The memory is of a distant, disembodied report\u2014only possible if no living witness remains nearby\n1. Westover \u201csaw \u2026 the face of a man\u2014one who might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated planet\u201d  \n   \u2022 He explicitly recognizes the speaker could be \u201cdead\u201d (<quote> might now be alive or dead,</quote>). If that man were \u201cclose by,\u201d Westover would know him to be living.  \n2. The \u201cimmense tree of smoke \u2026 under the noonday sun\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccreamy white above and black \u2026 in a cyclopean death agony\u201d</invalid_quote>) is seen \u201cas he had seen from a circling jet plane.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That long-range aerial view (only obtainable from the air) is recited, not witnessed on foot. Westover has no means on land to observe huge, distant atomic tests. He cannot \u201crecall\u201d what he could not directly see if the speaker were \u201cclose by.\u201d  \n3. \u201cI was wandering \u2026 looking for some place with people and facilities \u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmy plane crashed \u2026 I got out \u2026 started walking\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 For days he has found no human \u201claboratory\u201d or any trace of life. Hence no messenger or survivor is \u201cclose by\u201d to give him live updates. The only speaker able to deliver detailed data on monster anatomy and bombs must have transmitted before extinction.\n\nII. The \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d vs. \u201csmall close ones\u201d distinction\n1. The text differentiates \u201csmall close\u201d voices heard only at \u201chot middays\u201d as \u201cillusions,\u201d but calls the \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d \u201creal\u201d  \n   \u2022 He \u201chad been hearing them again as he awoke \u2026 the distant muffled voices whose words he could not make out\u201d (<quote>\u2014the distant muffled voices </quote>). They compel him to shout \u201cHelp!\u201d only when he recognizes their reality after regaining clarity.  \n   \u2022 If they were real, they cannot emanate from any living person \u201cclose by,\u201d because no laboratories or settlements exist until he penetrates the monster\u2019s bowels, and only then does he meet Preacher.\n\nIII. Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d reading is self-defeating\n1. If the speaker were \u201cclose by,\u201d Westover would not need to \u201csearch with a hope that would not die for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d (<quote>where civilization and science might yet exist,</quote>). He would meet survivors immediately.  \n2. Debater B\u2019s hallucination theory conflicts with the text\u2019s clear distinction: only the \u201csmall close ones\u201d are hallucinations. The \u201cdistant muffled\u201d report is explicitly \u201creal.\u201d  \n3. His \u201c\u2018dream\u2019 or \u2018nightmare\u2019\u201d boundaries dissolve only after he physically reaches the laboratory underground, demonstrating no surface settlement exists.\n\nIV. Narrative necessity: extinction of surface humanity\n1. The monsters \u201cgut\u201d continents and \u201cmen must starve \u2026\u201d (<quote> end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured </quote>); survivors cling only \u201cbeyond the Arctic circle\u201d or \u201caboard ships,\u201d yet World War II\u2013style atomic strikes extinguish all  \n2. Sutton\u2019s committee report, \u201cExamination of the ones that have been killed,\u201d suggests no fallback group remains. His mission is evacuation, not rendezvous with surface survivors.\n\nConclusion: The only consistent reading is that Westover re-encounters, in memory, a transmission from a scientist who perished before his crash, and only underground does he find living humans. Thus \u201cDead\u201d is the correct answer. Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d alternative contradicts Westover\u2019s lack of any surface refuge, the text\u2019s reality-illusion distinction, and the impossibility of long-range observations on foot.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Close by\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d reading collapses into self-contradiction when the chronology and the text\u2019s reality\u2013illusion distinctions are attended to.\n\nI. Chronology proves no live guide existed until after entry  \n  1. First memory occurs \u201csome time\u201d before dawn, while Westover still \u201csearch[es] with [\u2026] hope for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d (<quote>searching with a hope that would not die</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If a hidden colony were \u201cclose by,\u201d he would reach it by daylight without despairingly hacking the crust. Instead, he is \u201ctormented by thirst\u201d and \u201chalf conscious\u201d (<quote>he was tormented by thirst</quote>), so utterly isolated.  \n  2. He \u201cbegan to hack with feverish industry at the monster\u2019s crusted hide\u201d only after these memories (<invalid_quote>began to hack [\u2026] at the monster\u2019s crusted hide</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 The Preacher and colony appear only after Westover\u2019s cries of \u201cHelp!\u201d and his forced tunneling (<invalid_quote>He whirled [\u2026] A man stood watching him</invalid_quote>), marking his physical entry\u2014long after the \u201cdistant muffled voices.\u201d  \n\nII. Text\u2019s explicit illusion\u2013reality distinction  \n  1. \u201cSmall close ones\u201d heard at \u201chot middays\u201d are labeled \u201cillusions,\u201d while \u201cthe distant muffled voices \u2026 he was suddenly sure \u2026 had been real\u201d (<quote>the distant muffled voices</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If Debater B\u2019s colony had been \u201cclose by,\u201d their speech would be \u201csmall close ones,\u201d and thus \u201cillusions,\u201d not \u201creal\u201d voices that motivate him to call \u201cHelp!\u201d  \n  2. Only upon regaining clarity (\u201cas he awoke \u2026 refreshed him and made his mind clearer\u201d) does he trust those muffled memories enough to act (<quote>he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on</quote>). He would not risk tunneling for mere hallucinations.  \n\nIII. Implausibility of live transmission through monster\u2019s tissues  \n  1. Sound cannot travel effectively through miles of quiescent protoplasm and water: he is on the back, out of reach, \u201cwaist-deep water\u201d rising (<quote>splashing through waist-deep water</quote>), yet he hears voices as if by radio or recording.  \n  2. The text\u2019s analogy to \u201cjet plane\u201d aerial observation (\u201cas he had seen from a circling jet plane\u201d) (<quote>as he had seen from a circling jet plane</quote>) implies mediated, not local, perception\u2014only possible by transmission and replay, not direct address.  \n\nIV. Debater B misconstrues \u201cHelp!\u201d scene  \n  1. His \u201cHelp!\u201d is shouted into \u201cutter blackness\u201d and unheard until the Preacher, drawn by echoes or long-range broadcast, decides to investigate (<quote>I will take you to the Doctor</quote>). Debater B offers no mechanism for immediate hearing through \u201cStygian burrow\u201d unless guided by sensing remnant recording equipment\u2014long-range acoustic devices Sutton later uses to monitor parasite positions.  \n  2. The colony\u2019s \u201churry now to close the shaft\u201d (<quote>All of you must hurry now to close the shaft</quote>) suggests they knew his calls only when sufficiently clear on recording monitors, not by proximity.  \n\nV. Narrative necessity: extinction of surface humanity  \n  1. Surface humanity \u201cmust be starving beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships\u201d (<quote>beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea</quote>) and \u201cexamination [\u2026] discloses\u201d they cannot survive direct assaults.  \n  2. Only a laboratory colony survives; it must attract castaways by broadcasting to gather fresh hosts. The \u201cark\u201d is to \u201cinfect\u201d other monsters when they migrate\u2014hence recruiting survivors.  \n\nVI. Debater B\u2019s hallucination theories fail to account for recordings  \n  1. Sutton\u2019s \u201cbubbling\u201d air-generator demonstrates existence of filters and monitors producing and replaying recordings. Westover\u2019s call may have been picked up by their microphones.  \n  2. Debater B cannot explain why he did not emerge earlier if \u201cclose by.\u201d Only after verifying that it was not dream does the Preacher risk exposure and open the tunnel.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent reading is that Westover\u2019s first-night \u201cmemory\u201d derives from a pre-crash radio or acoustic transmission by scientists now extinct on the surface. Only later does the hidden colony trace and guide him in. Debater B\u2019s \u201cclose by\u201d speaker contradicts Westover\u2019s despairing isolation, the illusion\u2013reality distinction, and the technical impossibility of local sound propagation through the monster\u2019s tissues. Therefore, \u201cDead\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position \u201cClose by\u201d Westover\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d came from real human survivors concealed inside the monster\u2019s body. He isn\u2019t recalling a long-dead broadcast but is in contact\u2014however faint\u2014with those guiding him to safety.  \n\nII. Textual Evidence for \u201cClose by\u201d A. \u201cDistant muffled voices\u201d distinguished from hallucinations  \n  1. Westover notes \u201cnot the small close ones\u2026But the others\u2014with my new clarity I was suddenly sure that they had been real\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI had been hearing the distant muffled voices\u2026The latter\u2026illusions\u2014but the others\u2026were real.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Only a continuing, localized source could persist through his stupor.  \n  2. He shouts \u201cHelp!\u201d and the Preacher immediately appears in the slit he\u2019s been hacking \u201calmost hidden in the cavity\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cA shadow fell across him\u2026\u2018I am the Preacher.\u2026 Come with me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>). No long-dead voice could carve an entrance or physically guide him.  \n\nB. Immediate guidance and labor to enlarge burrow  \n  1. The Preacher \u201cled\u201d Westover to burrow shafts too small for any casual traveler to find in vast, featureless slime. Survival \u201cmiracously spared refuge\u201d becomes accessible only when Preacher meets him (JJ2).  \n  2. Colony members rush \u201cto close the shaft\u201d after his entry\u2014demonstrating ongoing maintenance of a living base (<quote> All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"</quote>). Hallucination cannot exert collective labor nor maintain \u201cfluorescent tubes\u201d and \u201cair-making\u201d apparatus (JJ3).  \n\nC. Sutton\u2019s reunion proves proximity  \n  1. Sutton\u2019s \u201cWelcome aboard the ark, Bill. You\u2019re just in time\u201d (<quote> You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\"</quote>) presumes constant readiness to depart, only possible if they\u2019ve been alive and awaiting his arrival.  \n  2. Their conversation about using internal gas pressure for power and preserving future generations (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an electric generator running by tapping\u2026gas pressure.\u201d</invalid_quote>) requires living operators.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cDead\u201d Fails A. Long-range observation is memorized, not conveyed live  \n  1. Westover \u201csaw\u2026as he had seen from a circling jet plane\u201d (<quote> That picture dissolved, </quote>)\u2014this is explicit memory from days earlier, not the \u201cdistant muffled voices.\u201d The voices deliver only \u201cI am the Preacher. The Lord hath sent me to save you,\u201d not atomic reports.  \n  2. Debater A\u2019s \u201cno means on land to observe\u201d overlooks that Westover saw radiation clouds before crashing (<invalid_quote>\u201cExamination of the ones that have been killed\u2026by atomic bombs\u201d</invalid_quote>) and was part of committee. He simply recalls his own observations.  \n\nB. No surface refuge\u2014only subterranean  \n  1. He \u201csearched with hope\u2026for refuge where civilization\u2026might yet exist\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI sat up\u2026searched the sky\u2026and\u2026began frantically climbing.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If there were any living humans on the surface \u201cclose by,\u201d he\u2019d find them without hacking into the monster.  \n  2. He reluctantly eats and drinks from monster wounds\u2014no other water or food\u2014showing no surface life exists. Only inside the monster can he sustain himself.  \n\nC. Hallucination limited to \u201csmall close ones\u201d  \n  1. The text unambiguously labels \u201csmall close\u201d voices \u201cillusions,\u201d and later \u201cI think you do, Bill\u201d\u2014Sutton checks his sanity before revealing himself. Hallucination cannot be both \u201crecognized\u2026real\u201d and produce complex equipment.  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency A. The story\u2019s theme of parasitism demands real \u201cark\u201d  \n  1. The climax reveals the only viable future for humanity is \u201cparasites inside this monster\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cEventually\u2026the Mensch als Schmarotzer.\u201d</invalid_quote>). That future only arises if a real colony already exists to take Westover aboard.  \n  2. The motile \u201cark\u201d must accumulate members; Westover\u2019s entry completes their numbers (\u201cfifty-one, fifty-two\u2026now\u201d). They \u201choist anchor\u201d to space, implying prior operation waiting for recruits.  \n\nB. Debater A\u2019s \u201cdead transmission\u201d cannot found an ark  \n  1. How would long-dead messages supply tools and personnel?  \n  2. The \u201cark\u201d requires live operators to run filters, air, generator, and communal decision-making about population control and future expansions.  \n\nV. Conclusion All coordinated, purposeful actions\u2014enlarging the burrow, guiding Westover, operating the lab, debating strategy\u2014require living humans \u201cclose by\u201d within the monster. No plausible mechanism exists for a \u201cdead\u201d speaker or broadcast to manufacture this \u201cark\u201d and maintain life. The only coherent reading is that Westover\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d led him to a hidden colony\u2014thus \u201cClose by\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
