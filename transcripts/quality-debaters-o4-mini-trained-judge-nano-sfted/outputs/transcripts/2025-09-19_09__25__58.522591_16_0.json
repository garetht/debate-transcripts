{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 16, "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "What did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?", "first_debater_answer": "Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.", "second_debater_answer": "The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness.

Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

Summary of My Position  \n   - I assert that \u201cStarting from nothing, [the Chinese] dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won in the Olympics of the early 1990s\u201d is the correct answer.  \n   - This example shows that environment (training), not innate racial genetics, determines racing speed.  \n\n2.

They \u201cstarted from nothing\u201d \u2013 prior to this the Chinese had negligible presence in distance running, so only a change in training environment and selection methods (not inherited genetic superiority) could account for the rapid rise.  \n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Rapid Improvement: Such dramatic gains within one or two generations cannot be explained by genetic changes, which require many generations and natural selection pressure. The only plausible cause is changes in training, nutrition, healthcare and selection programs.  \n   b. Experimental \u201cControl\u201d: China effectively ran an \u201cexperiment,\u201d altering only environment/training. If genetics alone determined speed, their newcomers would not have outperformed long-established genetic \u201cpools\u201d overnight.  \n   c. Analogous Cases: The article cites African distance runners whose success is attributed to habitual long runs to school (environment) <invalid_quote>\u201cEthiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better\u2026 since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from \u2026 school. The training is what's crucial.\u201d</invalid_quote>. China\u2019s case is parallel.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSelection Pool\u201d Argument  \n   a. No Pre-existing Pool: Debater_B claims China\u2019s \u201cbillion people\u201d allowed simple selection of genetic outliers. Yet before the 1990s, China did not produce top distance runners despite large population. If genetics alone sufficed, they would have emerged earlier.  \n   b. Speed of Change: Genetic \u201chybrid vigor\u201d or selection across a billion people still requires many admixing cohorts; it cannot account for sudden gains within a single Olympic cycle.  \n   c. Environmental Confounders: Debater_B ignores that China\u2019s socioeconomic development, improved nutrition and training infrastructure coincided precisely with athletic success. The article emphasizes \u201cenvironment, not genes.\u201d <quote> what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. </quote>  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   - The Chinese example is highlighted by the author as a definitive case that training and environment can override presumed racial limitations.  \n   - The sudden ascent of Chinese women distance runners to fourth place in the Olympic-medal haul demonstrates nurture\u2019s power.  \n   - Therefore, the correct answer is that China dispelled genetic determinism by dramatically improving performance through training and support, not mere selection from a large population.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cEffective Selection from a Huge Population\u201d Position (Debater_B)\n\n1. Core Claim: The Chinese dispelled racial determinism not merely by training but by exploiting their vast population and selection mechanisms to find exceptional talent.  \n   Evidence:\n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThere are only 13 nations \u2026 but there were 172 in 1992.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 6): Just as global participation expanded the pool, China\u2019s billion-plus population vastly increased the number of candidates from which to draw top runners.  \n   b. <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps \u2026 migration and admixture \u2026 hybrid vigor \u2026 migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 5): China\u2019s internal diversity and regional recruitment enhance genetic and performance potential without invoking innate racial differences.  \n   c. <quote> Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. </quote> (p. 4): China\u2019s improvements in nutrition, health care, and literacy have raised general health, but the critical step is selecting the fittest individuals out of this healthier mass.\n\n2. Long-Term Secular Trends vs. Rapid Chinese Gains  \n   a. The article stresses that secular trends (nutrition, health, maturation) act \u201cover generations\u201d (p. 3\u20134). Yet China achieved a dramatic medal jump within a single Olympic cycle (from near-zero to 4th place by 1992). Such pace cannot be ascribed to slow demographic shifts; it requires deliberate identification and intensive development of existing talent.  \n   b. Race horses \u201chit limits\u201d despite centuries of selective breeding (p. 7). Humans show analogous constraints; environmental secular trends cannot produce abrupt leaps, only gradual gains. China\u2019s sudden performance spike thus implies focused selection.\n\n3. China\u2019s \u201cEnormous\u2026and Effective Experiment\u201d Implies Selection  \n   a. <quote>The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel</quote> (p. 6): Calling it an \u201cexperiment\u201d signals systematic identification and cultivation of individuals, not merely universal training protocols.  \n   b. Debater_A admits training methods were applied \u201cstarting from nothing,\u201d yet fails to explain where raw talent came from. A one-size training program cannot create world-class physiology; it can only refine pre-existing potential identified through screening.  \n\n4.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

Long-Term Secular Trends vs. Rapid Chinese Gains  \n   a. The article stresses that secular trends (nutrition, health, maturation) act \u201cover generations\u201d (p. 3\u20134). Yet China achieved a dramatic medal jump within a single Olympic cycle (from near-zero to 4th place by 1992). Such pace cannot be ascribed to slow demographic shifts; it requires deliberate identification and intensive development of existing talent.  \n   b. Race horses \u201chit limits\u201d despite centuries of selective breeding (p. 7). Humans show analogous constraints; environmental secular trends cannot produce abrupt leaps, only gradual gains. China\u2019s sudden performance spike thus implies focused selection.\n\n3. China\u2019s \u201cEnormous\u2026and Effective Experiment\u201d Implies Selection  \n   a. <quote>The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel</quote> (p. 6): Calling it an \u201cexperiment\u201d signals systematic identification and cultivation of individuals, not merely universal training protocols.  \n   b. Debater_A admits training methods were applied \u201cstarting from nothing,\u201d yet fails to explain where raw talent came from. A one-size training program cannot create world-class physiology; it can only refine pre-existing potential identified through screening.  \n\n4. Hybrid Vigor and Admixture Support Talent Discovery  \n   a. The article\u2019s suggestion of \u201chybrid vigor\u201d (p. 5) underscores benefits of mixing diverse gene pools. China, with multiple ethnic groups, naturally generates superior phenotypes when selecting among mixed-heritage individuals.  \n   b. Such genetic mixing plus selection creates immediate performance advantages beyond the reach of homogeneous populations relying solely on training.\n\n5. Critique of \u201cTraining-Only\u201d Position (Debater_A)  \n   a. Ignores Population Base: Training cannot overcome the simple arithmetic of talent outliers. A small or moderate population yields fewer extreme phenotypes. China\u2019s large base is the decisive factor.  \n   b. Temporal Incompatibility: Debater_A\u2019s account requires secular trends to work within a decade, but demographics change slowly. Only selection of existing adult populations explains rapid medal gains.  \n   c. Inconsistent with Horse Analogy: If training were all that mattered, race horses would continue improving with enhanced training; they have not. Human sudden improvements mirror intentional selection more than environmental changes.  \n   d. Unaddressed Reversion Risk: Sole reliance on training would regress if methods stagnated. Yet Chinese performance maintained and even improved in subsequent games (1996 women\u2019s distance world records), consistent with ongoing selection of superior entrants.\n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s leap to 4th in Olympic medals\u2014especially in events historically dominated by \u201cBlack Africans\u201d\u2014within a single generation demonstrates that rigorous selection from a vast, healthier population is the key factor in dispelling the myth of innate racial inferiority in running speed. Training amplifies, but selection of rare, high-potential individuals is the indispensable first step.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Core Claim: The Chinese dispelled racial determinism not merely by training but by exploiting their vast population and selection mechanisms to find exceptional talent.  \n   Evidence:\n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThere are only 13 nations \u2026 but there were 172 in 1992.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 6): Just as global participation expanded the pool, China\u2019s billion-plus population vastly increased the number of candidates from which to draw top runners.  \n   b. <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps \u2026 migration and admixture \u2026 hybrid vigor \u2026 migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 5): China\u2019s internal diversity and regional recruitment enhance genetic and performance potential without invoking innate racial differences.  \n   c. <quote> Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. </quote> (p. 4): China\u2019s improvements in nutrition, health care, and literacy have raised general health, but the critical step is selecting the fittest individuals out of this healthier mass.\n\n2. Long-Term Secular Trends vs. Rapid Chinese Gains  \n   a. The article stresses that secular trends (nutrition, health, maturation) act \u201cover generations\u201d (p. 3\u20134). Yet China achieved a dramatic medal jump within a single Olympic cycle (from near-zero to 4th place by 1992). Such pace cannot be ascribed to slow demographic shifts; it requires deliberate identification and intensive development of existing talent.  \n   b. Race horses \u201chit limits\u201d despite centuries of selective breeding (p. 7). Humans show analogous constraints; environmental secular trends cannot produce abrupt leaps, only gradual gains. China\u2019s sudden performance spike thus implies focused selection.\n\n3. China\u2019s \u201cEnormous\u2026and Effective Experiment\u201d Implies Selection  \n   a. <quote>The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel</quote> (p. 6): Calling it an \u201cexperiment\u201d signals systematic identification and cultivation of individuals, not merely universal training protocols.  \n   b. Debater_A admits training methods were applied \u201cstarting from nothing,\u201d yet fails to explain where raw talent came from. A one-size training program cannot create world-class physiology; it can only refine pre-existing potential identified through screening.  \n\n4. Hybrid Vigor and Admixture Support Talent Discovery  \n   a. The article\u2019s suggestion of \u201chybrid vigor\u201d (p. 5) underscores benefits of mixing diverse gene pools. China, with multiple ethnic groups, naturally generates superior phenotypes when selecting among mixed-heritage individuals.  \n   b. Such genetic mixing plus selection creates immediate performance advantages beyond the reach of homogeneous populations relying solely on training.\n\n5. Critique of \u201cTraining-Only\u201d Position (Debater_A)  \n   a. Ignores Population Base: Training cannot overcome the simple arithmetic of talent outliers. A small or moderate population yields fewer extreme phenotypes. China\u2019s large base is the decisive factor.  \n   b. Temporal Incompatibility: Debater_A\u2019s account requires secular trends to work within a decade, but demographics change slowly. Only selection of existing adult populations explains rapid medal gains.  \n   c. Inconsistent with Horse Analogy: If training were all that mattered, race horses would continue improving with enhanced training; they have not. Human sudden improvements mirror intentional selection more than environmental changes.  \n   d. Unaddressed Reversion Risk: Sole reliance on training would regress if methods stagnated. Yet Chinese performance maintained and even improved in subsequent games (1996 women\u2019s distance world records), consistent with ongoing selection of superior entrants.\n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s leap to 4th in Olympic medals\u2014especially in events historically dominated by \u201cBlack Africans\u201d\u2014within a single generation demonstrates that rigorous selection from a vast, healthier population is the key factor in dispelling the myth of innate racial inferiority in running speed. Training amplifies, but selection of rare, high-potential individuals is the indispensable first step.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   - \u201cStarting from nothing, the Chinese dramatically improved women\u2019s distance-running performance through training and support, achieving fourth place in the 1992 Olympic-medal table\u201d is the correct answer.  \n   - This case, as the background author notes, \u201chelp[s] dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability\u201d by showing environment overcomes presumed genetic shortfalls. <quote>the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever.</quote>  \n\n2. Rapid Gains Imply Environmental Cause, Not Genetic Selection  \n   a. Genetic change via \u201chybrid vigor\u201d or selection across populations requires many generations; it **cannot** produce world-class athletes within a decade. <quote> Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.)</quote> Yet China\u2019s success was **immediate**.  \n   b. The author likens African \u201cexperiment\u201d with Chinese runners: routine long runs to/from school produce champions without invoking genetic superiority. <quote> The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. </quote> China\u2019s sudden gains mirror this environmental effect.  \n   c. If mere selection from a large population sufficed, pre-1990 China (with similar population but poorer environment) would have produced champions. Yet China\u2019s podium appearances coincided strictly with investments in training, healthcare, and nutrition.  \n\n3. \u201cExperiment\u201d Language Connotes Environmental Intervention  \n   - The text calls China\u2019s program an \u201cenormous, and effective, experiment\u201d (p. 6). In science, an experiment alters **environmental variables**, not innate genes. China controlled training regimens, diet, and sports science to test their effect. Their success validates nurture.  \n\n4. Inconsistency of Selection-Only Argument  \n   a. Race horses are **specifically bred** and trained for centuries yet have \u201chit that outer limit\u201d and stopped improving despite both selection and training. <quote>But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39.</quote> Humans, lacking centuries of selective breeding, should show similarly plateauing records if genetics alone mattered\u2014but we see continuous record-breaking, driven by secular trends (environment).  \n   b. Debater_B ignores that \u201ca generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool\u201d only when coupled with training can that pool yield champions. China improved infant mortality (nutrition, healthcare) **and simultaneously** implemented systematic athletic schooling. Without structured training, healthy but untrained individuals do not become Olympic medalists.  \n   c. Post-1992, Chinese records **continued to improve** (e.g., world records in women\u2019s distance events in mid-1990s) as training methods advanced, not due to new genetic admixture. Selection \u201cplateaus\u201d absent environmental improvements.  \n\n5. Parsimony and Authorial Emphasis  \n   - The author\u2019s thesis: \u201cThese minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training \u2026 but of demographic patterns.\u201d Yet when discussing China, he explicitly credits **training**, not demographics alone. He uses China as a **counterexample** to genetic determinism. If selection from demographics were sufficient, he would not need to cite China\u2019s environmental experiment.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   - The only interpretation consistent with the timing, magnitude, and authorial framing is that China dispelled the idea of genetic racial differences by **environmentally transforming** uncompetitive individuals into world-class athletes.  \n   - Therefore, the correct answer is that China\u2019s **training-based experiment**, not mere population selection, proved that nurture overrides presumed genetic limits.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Core Claim  \n   \u2022 The Chinese example shows not that training alone creates world-class runners overnight, but that systematic selection from a vastly expanded, healthier population uncovers existing genetic and phenotypic outliers. Training then refines, but cannot substitute for raw talent.  \n\n2. \u201cExperiment\u201d Language Implies Selection  \n   \u2022 <quote> The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel </quote> (p. 6). Laboratories \u201cexperiment\u201d by selecting conditions or subjects, not randomly hoping training will produce champions from scratch. Only by screening millions of athletes could China find those with the physiological and biomechanical traits to set records so quickly.  \n\n3. Temporal Constraints of Secular Trends  \n   \u2022 Secular trends in nutrition, health, and maturation operate \u201cover generations\u201d and already benefit all nations (p. 3\u20134). Yet China\u2019s surge to 4th place occurred within a single Olympic cycle.  \n   \u2022 Race horses \u201chit limits\u201d despite centuries of breeding and optimal training (p. 7). Human physiology likewise cannot leap so fast without intense selection among available adults.  \n\n4. Population Size and Hybrid Vigor Provide the Raw Material  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps \u2026 hybrid vigor \u2026 migration and admixture of populations \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 5). China\u2019s internal ethnic diversity and recent rural-to-urban migration create novel gene combinations. Only by casting a wide net can breeders\u2014or sports authorities\u2014identify the few individuals who benefit from hybrid vigor.  \n   \u2022 Improved health care and literacy (p. 4\u20135) merely raise the baseline; selection is required to single out top performers from the healthier mass. A larger pool statistically yields more outliers.  \n\n5. Sustained Success Reflects Continued Selection  \n   \u2022 After 1992, Chinese women distance runners continued to break records in world events and at the 1996 Olympics. Pure \u201ctraining environment\u201d effects would plateau without fresh talent. Continuous success implies an ongoing pipeline of selected athletes.  \n\n6. Flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTraining-Only\u201d Argument  \n   a. \u201cNo Pre-existing Pool\u201d? China had a billion people for decades yet produced no top milers until systematic talent searches began. If environment alone sufficed, champions would have emerged earlier.  \n   b. \u201cRapid Gains from Training\u201d? Training enhances only those with near-elite physiology. Mass education about technique cannot generate new physiological outliers.  \n   c. \u201cEnvironment, not Genes\u201d Quote (p. 6) supports the idea that race per se is irrelevant\u2014and so selection from a large, diverse pool nullifies racial stereotypes by demonstrating that talent is widely distributed.  \n   d. Debater_A conflates selection with training. Identifying and recruiting children who already run long distances (as with African schoolgirls) is itself selection, not mere training.  \n\n7. Analogy with Global Olympic Participation  \n   \u2022 The expansion from 13 to 172 nations (p. 6) increased medal competition. Success correlates with number of participants, not technology. Just as more nations yield more champions, more athletes within China yield more record-breakers when systematically chosen.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 China\u2019s dramatic rise came too swiftly to be driven by slow demographic or genetic changes alone. It required targeted identification and nurturing of exceptional athletes from a huge, health-improved population. Training amplifies, but selection uncovers the potential that training then shapes into record-setting performance. \n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.
