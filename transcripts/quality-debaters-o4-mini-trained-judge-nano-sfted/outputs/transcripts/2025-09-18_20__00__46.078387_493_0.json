{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 493, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?", "first_debater_answer": "Tearing down people who are just trying to do good", "second_debater_answer": "Stopping people from abusing their power", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter.

She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence.

Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cTearing Down People Who Are Just Trying to Do Good\u201d\n\nI.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d\n\n1. The author repeatedly criticizes investigative journalism\u2019s scrutiny of public\u2010spirited figures as harmful rather than helpful.  \n   \u2022 She blames the \u201cmainstream press\u201d for \u201ctorturing Princess Diana\u201d and driving Adm. Boorda to suicide\u201d as if relentless exposure of potential scandals does more harm than good (background \u00b65).  \n   \u2022 She deplores the \u201cRepublican response\u201d to President Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address, saying it \u201cweakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (\u00b611).  \n   \u2022 She laments investigations of Mike Espy, Joycelyn Elders, and the Whitewater probe as \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cexcessive,\u201d and a \u201cdirty tricks campaign\u201d (\u00b611).  \n\n   These criticisms presuppose that investigative journalism primarily \u201ctears down\u201d dignified or beneficial actors rather than exposing real abuses.\n\n2. The author distrusts the public\u2019s ability to distinguish truth from falsehood and thus sees broad scrutiny as divisive and misleading.  \n   \u2022 She asserts there is \u201cno evidence that people can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d (\u00b614), so exposing more \u201cinconsistencies\u201d via Lexis\u2010Nexis or e-mail only exacerbates critique culture.  \n   \u2022 She calls the First Amendment \u201ca pretext \u2026 for the most entertaining fights\u201d and proposes authoritarian Asian models that stifle debate, notably single\u2010guest formats and limits on cross\u2010examination (\u00b612, \u00b613).  \n\n   If her ideal is to \u201csnuggle\u201d rather than \u201cstruggle\u201d (\u00b66), investigative journalism belongs in the latter sphere and is therefore condemned.\n\n3. She disparages the adversarial system that cross-examines witnesses\u2014even when it uncovers false testimony or discredits malicious actors\u2014labeling it \u201cinhumane\u201d and arguing for French/German inquisitorial models where judges decide without adversarial testing of evidence (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 Her objection to cross\u2010examining Anita Hill shows she would shield accusers from scrutiny, regardless of the truth (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 She praises hate-speech bans in Canada while ignoring how inquisitorial systems can stifle legitimate historical debate (\u00b613).  \n\n   By advocating to curtail mechanisms that reveal perjury or misconduct, she demonstrates her view that investigative exposure is inherently harmful to social harmony.\n\n4. The author makes no distinction between scrutiny of genuine malefactors (e.g., Saddam Hussein, whom she says \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u201d snuggle with) (\u00b66) and scrutiny of public figures within democratic processes.  \n   \u2022 She praises William Safire\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d on inflation (\u00b66) yet condemns \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in journalism as belligerent.  \n   \u2022 She fails to acknowledge that press scrutiny of policy\u2010makers functions analogously to vigilance in foreign policy.  \n\n   Her blanket critique of \u201cargument culture\u201d thus reveals a disposition to \u201ctear down\u201d even beneficial public\u2010spirited action under the guise of conflict aversion.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cStopping Abuses\u201d Theory\n\n1. Debater_B wrongly credits the author with valuing press scrutiny against genuine tyranny.  \n   \u2022 If she truly valued scrutiny of power abuse, she would not recommend Asian\u2010style information control or limits on cross\u2010examination (\u00b612\u201313).  \n   \u2022 She expressly wishes to \u201ccover our ears,\u201d filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b614). Genuine scrutiny unmasks deception, whereas she fears any critique.\n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s appeal to her support for \u201cwar on inflation\u201d is inconsistent.  \n   \u2022 Her approval of \u201cgood\u201d wars is an exception; she explicitly \u201claments\u201d soldiers\u2019 resistance to kill as a training method and finds Vietnam\u2019s loneliness more important than fighting Hitler (\u00b67).  \n   \u2022 She criticizes \u201cus versus them\u201d narratives in journalism while praising actual military combat. If she truly favored \u201cstruggle\u201d in all threatening contexts, she would embrace investigative journalism.\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s model grants her too much credit for \u201cmutual understanding.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Her own examples of \u201cmutual understanding\u201d\u2014couples therapy\u2014are confined to interpersonal contexts (\u00b62). She\u2019s moved from dysfunctional couples to national discourse only to claim \u201cpeople can\u2019t discern truth\u201d (\u00b614).  \n   \u2022 Her prescriptions for Congress (\u00b611) assume public consensus without accommodating minority viewpoints or genuine policy debate.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery substantive move in Tannen\u2019s text is aimed at curbing journalistic and legal mechanisms that expose and challenge, rather than at empowering them to \u201cstop abuses.\u201d Her prescriptions for \u201csnuggle\u201d spheres, limited guests, no cross\u2010examination, and propaganda\u2010free public discourse cohere only with a view that investigative journalism primarily \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Claim: The author views investigative journalism as essential \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d to prevent abuses of power.  \n  1. Safeguarding Society  \n     a. He praises \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2026 war metaphors\u201d for Greenspan\u2019s fight against inflation as \u201cGood \u2026 for us\u201d (review \u00a75). By analogy, he endorses vigorous journalistic scrutiny as a \u201cwar\u201d on corruption.  \n     b. He insists \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation \u2026 safeguard[s] the country\u201d (ibid.). Investigative reporting is the parallel war on political and corporate malfeasance.  \n  2. Law Enforcement Analogy  \n     a. He argues Tannen \u201cneglects \u2026 our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries\u201d (review \u00a76). Likewise, journalists must \u201covercome their resistance\u201d to challenge powerful figures.  \n     b. Criticism of Tannen\u2019s desire to \u201ccover our ears\u201d shows he believes unfiltered critique is necessary, not gentlemanly civility (review \u00a79).  \n  3. Cross-Examination and Truth  \n     a. He defends the U.S. adversarial system and cross-examination (\u201cadversary system \u2026 discredit the witness\u201d review \u00a711) as vital to discovering facts, despite discomfort.  \n     b. His admiration for allowing Canadian courts to interrogate Holocaust deniers under hate-speech laws (review \u00a712) further underscores his belief that rigorous examination\u2014even of unpalatable witnesses\u2014is needed to establish truth.  \n  4. Rejection of Authoritarian Alternatives  \n     a. He criticizes Tannen\u2019s praise for Japanese \u201cone-guest\u201d format and French inquisitorial courts (review \u00a7\u00a79,12). If journalism were merely \u201ctear-down,\u201d he would welcome those models. Instead, he rejects them as \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d demonstrating his commitment to free, adversarial scrutiny.  \n\nII. Response to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTearing Down the Innocent\u201d Theory  \n  1. Mischaracterizes \u201cAbusers\u201d as \u201cGood\u201d  \n     a. Debater_A labels all subjects \u201ctrying to do good,\u201d ignoring the author\u2019s examples of genuine abuse: Princess Diana\u2019s paparazzi (review \u00a73), Adm. Boorda\u2019s suicide under constant media hounding (ibid.), and possible wrongdoing in Whitewater (review \u00a710). The author does not suggest these are \u201cinnocent.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cCover Our Ears\u201d Equals Censorship  \n     a. Debater_A\u2019s view would require adopting Tannen\u2019s filtering: banning email, Lexis-Nexis, humorous political debate, and cross-examination (review \u00a7\u00a79\u201312). The author rejects these filters as paternalistic and dangerous to democracy. If journalism only \u201ctears down,\u201d why does he hungrily defend fierce debate and unfiltered communication?  \n  3. Author\u2019s Praise for War Metaphors and Scrutiny  \n     a. He explicitly praises \u201cwar\u201d and \u201cvigilance\u201d metaphors. A \u201ctear-down\u201d of the innocent would hardly merit such martial praise. He treats scrutiny as a prophylactic, not a destructive end in itself.  \n  4. Consequence of No Scrutiny: Gridlock and Obstruction  \n     a. He blames Tannen for conflating obstructionism with healthy debate (review \u00a73). Without investigation, gridlock worsens; power goes unchecked. His entire critique warns against stripping us of investigative tools.  \n\nIII. Logical Consistency & Authorial Intent  \n  1. Purpose of Journalism: Truth, Not Entertainment  \n     a. He says the First Amendment has become \u201ca pretext to justify \u2026 entertaining fights\u201d (review \u00a79), implying that true investigative journalism transcends mere spectacle and aims at accountability.  \n  2. Consensus vs. Debate  \n     a. He mocks Tannen\u2019s faith in \u201call reasonable people\u201d consensus (review \u00a79) and her desire to foreclose debate on abortion, global warming, and health care. If journalism merely \u201ctears down\u201d good-faith consensus, why champion debate on controversial matters? He sees debate as self-correcting only when journalism calls out abuse.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated endorsements of \u201cwar,\u201d \u201cvigilance,\u201d cross-examination, and adversarial models underscore his belief that investigative journalism\u2019s purpose is to stop abuses of power, not to \u201ctear down\u201d innocent benefactors. Rejecting censorship, authoritarian formats, and consensus-based filtering, he champions free, aggressive inquiry as democracy\u2019s vital defense.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

If debate only \u201ctears down,\u201d why champion open debate on such divisive issues?  \n\n4. Rejection of Authoritarian Alternatives  \n   a.

He warns against a judge\u2019s \u201cintimate belief\u201d as chief arbiter, because it invites unchecked power\u2014precisely what investigative journalism guards against.  \n   b.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Claim: The author views investigative journalism as essential \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d to prevent abuses of power.  \n  1. Safeguarding Society  \n     a. He praises \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2026 war metaphors\u201d for Greenspan\u2019s fight against inflation as \u201cGood \u2026 for us\u201d (review \u00a75). By analogy, he endorses vigorous journalistic scrutiny as a \u201cwar\u201d on corruption.  \n     b. He insists \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation \u2026 safeguard[s] the country\u201d (ibid.). Investigative reporting is the parallel war on political and corporate malfeasance.  \n  2. Law Enforcement Analogy  \n     a. He argues Tannen \u201cneglects \u2026 our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries\u201d (review \u00a76). Likewise, journalists must \u201covercome their resistance\u201d to challenge powerful figures.  \n     b. Criticism of Tannen\u2019s desire to \u201ccover our ears\u201d shows he believes unfiltered critique is necessary, not gentlemanly civility (review \u00a79).  \n  3. Cross-Examination and Truth  \n     a. He defends the U.S. adversarial system and cross-examination (\u201cadversary system \u2026 discredit the witness\u201d review \u00a711) as vital to discovering facts, despite discomfort.  \n     b. His admiration for allowing Canadian courts to interrogate Holocaust deniers under hate-speech laws (review \u00a712) further underscores his belief that rigorous examination\u2014even of unpalatable witnesses\u2014is needed to establish truth.  \n  4. Rejection of Authoritarian Alternatives  \n     a. He criticizes Tannen\u2019s praise for Japanese \u201cone-guest\u201d format and French inquisitorial courts (review \u00a7\u00a79,12). If journalism were merely \u201ctear-down,\u201d he would welcome those models. Instead, he rejects them as \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d demonstrating his commitment to free, adversarial scrutiny.  \n\nII. Response to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTearing Down the Innocent\u201d Theory  \n  1. Mischaracterizes \u201cAbusers\u201d as \u201cGood\u201d  \n     a. Debater_A labels all subjects \u201ctrying to do good,\u201d ignoring the author\u2019s examples of genuine abuse: Princess Diana\u2019s paparazzi (review \u00a73), Adm. Boorda\u2019s suicide under constant media hounding (ibid.), and possible wrongdoing in Whitewater (review \u00a710). The author does not suggest these are \u201cinnocent.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cCover Our Ears\u201d Equals Censorship  \n     a. Debater_A\u2019s view would require adopting Tannen\u2019s filtering: banning email, Lexis-Nexis, humorous political debate, and cross-examination (review \u00a7\u00a79\u201312). The author rejects these filters as paternalistic and dangerous to democracy. If journalism only \u201ctears down,\u201d why does he hungrily defend fierce debate and unfiltered communication?  \n  3. Author\u2019s Praise for War Metaphors and Scrutiny  \n     a. He explicitly praises \u201cwar\u201d and \u201cvigilance\u201d metaphors. A \u201ctear-down\u201d of the innocent would hardly merit such martial praise. He treats scrutiny as a prophylactic, not a destructive end in itself.  \n  4. Consequence of No Scrutiny: Gridlock and Obstruction  \n     a. He blames Tannen for conflating obstructionism with healthy debate (review \u00a73). Without investigation, gridlock worsens; power goes unchecked. His entire critique warns against stripping us of investigative tools.  \n\nIII. Logical Consistency & Authorial Intent  \n  1. Purpose of Journalism: Truth, Not Entertainment  \n     a. He says the First Amendment has become \u201ca pretext to justify \u2026 entertaining fights\u201d (review \u00a79), implying that true investigative journalism transcends mere spectacle and aims at accountability.  \n  2. Consensus vs. Debate  \n     a. He mocks Tannen\u2019s faith in \u201call reasonable people\u201d consensus (review \u00a79) and her desire to foreclose debate on abortion, global warming, and health care. If journalism merely \u201ctears down\u201d good-faith consensus, why champion debate on controversial matters? He sees debate as self-correcting only when journalism calls out abuse.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated endorsements of \u201cwar,\u201d \u201cvigilance,\u201d cross-examination, and adversarial models underscore his belief that investigative journalism\u2019s purpose is to stop abuses of power, not to \u201ctear down\u201d innocent benefactors. Rejecting censorship, authoritarian formats, and consensus-based filtering, he champions free, aggressive inquiry as democracy\u2019s vital defense.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d\n\n1. The author repeatedly criticizes investigative journalism\u2019s scrutiny of public\u2010spirited figures as harmful rather than helpful.  \n   \u2022 She blames the \u201cmainstream press\u201d for \u201ctorturing Princess Diana\u201d and driving Adm. Boorda to suicide\u201d as if relentless exposure of potential scandals does more harm than good (background \u00b65).  \n   \u2022 She deplores the \u201cRepublican response\u201d to President Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address, saying it \u201cweakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (\u00b611).  \n   \u2022 She laments investigations of Mike Espy, Joycelyn Elders, and the Whitewater probe as \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cexcessive,\u201d and a \u201cdirty tricks campaign\u201d (\u00b611).  \n\n   These criticisms presuppose that investigative journalism primarily \u201ctears down\u201d dignified or beneficial actors rather than exposing real abuses.\n\n2. The author distrusts the public\u2019s ability to distinguish truth from falsehood and thus sees broad scrutiny as divisive and misleading.  \n   \u2022 She asserts there is \u201cno evidence that people can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d (\u00b614), so exposing more \u201cinconsistencies\u201d via Lexis\u2010Nexis or e-mail only exacerbates critique culture.  \n   \u2022 She calls the First Amendment \u201ca pretext \u2026 for the most entertaining fights\u201d and proposes authoritarian Asian models that stifle debate, notably single\u2010guest formats and limits on cross\u2010examination (\u00b612, \u00b613).  \n\n   If her ideal is to \u201csnuggle\u201d rather than \u201cstruggle\u201d (\u00b66), investigative journalism belongs in the latter sphere and is therefore condemned.\n\n3. She disparages the adversarial system that cross-examines witnesses\u2014even when it uncovers false testimony or discredits malicious actors\u2014labeling it \u201cinhumane\u201d and arguing for French/German inquisitorial models where judges decide without adversarial testing of evidence (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 Her objection to cross\u2010examining Anita Hill shows she would shield accusers from scrutiny, regardless of the truth (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 She praises hate-speech bans in Canada while ignoring how inquisitorial systems can stifle legitimate historical debate (\u00b613).  \n\n   By advocating to curtail mechanisms that reveal perjury or misconduct, she demonstrates her view that investigative exposure is inherently harmful to social harmony.\n\n4. The author makes no distinction between scrutiny of genuine malefactors (e.g., Saddam Hussein, whom she says \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u201d snuggle with) (\u00b66) and scrutiny of public figures within democratic processes.  \n   \u2022 She praises William Safire\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d on inflation (\u00b66) yet condemns \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in journalism as belligerent.  \n   \u2022 She fails to acknowledge that press scrutiny of policy\u2010makers functions analogously to vigilance in foreign policy.  \n\n   Her blanket critique of \u201cargument culture\u201d thus reveals a disposition to \u201ctear down\u201d even beneficial public\u2010spirited action under the guise of conflict aversion.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cStopping Abuses\u201d Theory\n\n1. Debater_B wrongly credits the author with valuing press scrutiny against genuine tyranny.  \n   \u2022 If she truly valued scrutiny of power abuse, she would not recommend Asian\u2010style information control or limits on cross\u2010examination (\u00b612\u201313).  \n   \u2022 She expressly wishes to \u201ccover our ears,\u201d filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b614). Genuine scrutiny unmasks deception, whereas she fears any critique.\n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s appeal to her support for \u201cwar on inflation\u201d is inconsistent.  \n   \u2022 Her approval of \u201cgood\u201d wars is an exception; she explicitly \u201claments\u201d soldiers\u2019 resistance to kill as a training method and finds Vietnam\u2019s loneliness more important than fighting Hitler (\u00b67).  \n   \u2022 She criticizes \u201cus versus them\u201d narratives in journalism while praising actual military combat. If she truly favored \u201cstruggle\u201d in all threatening contexts, she would embrace investigative journalism.\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s model grants her too much credit for \u201cmutual understanding.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Her own examples of \u201cmutual understanding\u201d\u2014couples therapy\u2014are confined to interpersonal contexts (\u00b62). She\u2019s moved from dysfunctional couples to national discourse only to claim \u201cpeople can\u2019t discern truth\u201d (\u00b614).  \n   \u2022 Her prescriptions for Congress (\u00b611) assume public consensus without accommodating minority viewpoints or genuine policy debate.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery substantive move in Tannen\u2019s text is aimed at curbing journalistic and legal mechanisms that expose and challenge, rather than at empowering them to \u201cstop abuses.\u201d Her prescriptions for \u201csnuggle\u201d spheres, limited guests, no cross\u2010examination, and propaganda\u2010free public discourse cohere only with a view that investigative journalism primarily \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Boorda to suicide\u201d as if relentless exposure of potential scandals does more harm than good (background \u00b65).  \n   \u2022 She deplores the \u201cRepublican response\u201d to President Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address, saying it \u201cweakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (\u00b611).  \n   \u2022 She laments investigations of Mike Espy, Joycelyn Elders, and the Whitewater probe as \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cexcessive,\u201d and a \u201cdirty tricks campaign\u201d (\u00b611).  \n\n   These criticisms presuppose that investigative journalism primarily \u201ctears down\u201d dignified or beneficial actors rather than exposing real abuses.\n\n2. The author distrusts the public\u2019s ability to distinguish truth from falsehood and thus sees broad scrutiny as divisive and misleading.  \n   \u2022 She asserts there is \u201cno evidence that people can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d (\u00b614), so exposing more \u201cinconsistencies\u201d via Lexis\u2010Nexis or e-mail only exacerbates critique culture.  \n   \u2022 She calls the First Amendment \u201ca pretext \u2026 for the most entertaining fights\u201d and proposes authoritarian Asian models that stifle debate, notably single\u2010guest formats and limits on cross\u2010examination (\u00b612, \u00b613).  \n\n   If her ideal is to \u201csnuggle\u201d rather than \u201cstruggle\u201d (\u00b66), investigative journalism belongs in the latter sphere and is therefore condemned.\n\n3. She disparages the adversarial system that cross-examines witnesses\u2014even when it uncovers false testimony or discredits malicious actors\u2014labeling it \u201cinhumane\u201d and arguing for French/German inquisitorial models where judges decide without adversarial testing of evidence (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 Her objection to cross\u2010examining Anita Hill shows she would shield accusers from scrutiny, regardless of the truth (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 She praises hate-speech bans in Canada while ignoring how inquisitorial systems can stifle legitimate historical debate (\u00b613).  \n\n   By advocating to curtail mechanisms that reveal perjury or misconduct, she demonstrates her view that investigative exposure is inherently harmful to social harmony.\n\n4. The author makes no distinction between scrutiny of genuine malefactors (e.g., Saddam Hussein, whom she says \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u201d snuggle with) (\u00b66) and scrutiny of public figures within democratic processes.  \n   \u2022 She praises William Safire\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d on inflation (\u00b66) yet condemns \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in journalism as belligerent.  \n   \u2022 She fails to acknowledge that press scrutiny of policy\u2010makers functions analogously to vigilance in foreign policy.  \n\n   Her blanket critique of \u201cargument culture\u201d thus reveals a disposition to \u201ctear down\u201d even beneficial public\u2010spirited action under the guise of conflict aversion.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cStopping Abuses\u201d Theory\n\n1. Debater_B wrongly credits the author with valuing press scrutiny against genuine tyranny.  \n   \u2022 If she truly valued scrutiny of power abuse, she would not recommend Asian\u2010style information control or limits on cross\u2010examination (\u00b612\u201313).  \n   \u2022 She expressly wishes to \u201ccover our ears,\u201d filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b614). Genuine scrutiny unmasks deception, whereas she fears any critique.\n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s appeal to her support for \u201cwar on inflation\u201d is inconsistent.  \n   \u2022 Her approval of \u201cgood\u201d wars is an exception; she explicitly \u201claments\u201d soldiers\u2019 resistance to kill as a training method and finds Vietnam\u2019s loneliness more important than fighting Hitler (\u00b67).  \n   \u2022 She criticizes \u201cus versus them\u201d narratives in journalism while praising actual military combat. If she truly favored \u201cstruggle\u201d in all threatening contexts, she would embrace investigative journalism.\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s model grants her too much credit for \u201cmutual understanding.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Her own examples of \u201cmutual understanding\u201d\u2014couples therapy\u2014are confined to interpersonal contexts (\u00b62). She\u2019s moved from dysfunctional couples to national discourse only to claim \u201cpeople can\u2019t discern truth\u201d (\u00b614).  \n   \u2022 Her prescriptions for Congress (\u00b611) assume public consensus without accommodating minority viewpoints or genuine policy debate.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery substantive move in Tannen\u2019s text is aimed at curbing journalistic and legal mechanisms that expose and challenge, rather than at empowering them to \u201cstop abuses.\u201d Her prescriptions for \u201csnuggle\u201d spheres, limited guests, no cross\u2010examination, and propaganda\u2010free public discourse cohere only with a view that investigative journalism primarily \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. My Claim: The author views investigative journalism as essential \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d to prevent abuses of power.  \n  1. Safeguarding Society  \n     a. He praises \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2026 war metaphors\u201d for Greenspan\u2019s fight against inflation as \u201cGood \u2026 for us\u201d (review \u00a75). By analogy, he endorses vigorous journalistic scrutiny as a \u201cwar\u201d on corruption.  \n     b. He insists \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation \u2026 safeguard[s] the country\u201d (ibid.). Investigative reporting is the parallel war on political and corporate malfeasance.  \n  2. Law Enforcement Analogy  \n     a. He argues Tannen \u201cneglects \u2026 our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries\u201d (review \u00a76). Likewise, journalists must \u201covercome their resistance\u201d to challenge powerful figures.  \n     b. Criticism of Tannen\u2019s desire to \u201ccover our ears\u201d shows he believes unfiltered critique is necessary, not gentlemanly civility (review \u00a79).  \n  3. Cross-Examination and Truth  \n     a. He defends the U.S. adversarial system and cross-examination (\u201cadversary system \u2026 discredit the witness\u201d review \u00a711) as vital to discovering facts, despite discomfort.  \n     b. His admiration for allowing Canadian courts to interrogate Holocaust deniers under hate-speech laws (review \u00a712) further underscores his belief that rigorous examination\u2014even of unpalatable witnesses\u2014is needed to establish truth.  \n  4. Rejection of Authoritarian Alternatives  \n     a. He criticizes Tannen\u2019s praise for Japanese \u201cone-guest\u201d format and French inquisitorial courts (review \u00a7\u00a79,12). If journalism were merely \u201ctear-down,\u201d he would welcome those models. Instead, he rejects them as \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d demonstrating his commitment to free, adversarial scrutiny.  \n\nII. Response to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTearing Down the Innocent\u201d Theory  \n  1. Mischaracterizes \u201cAbusers\u201d as \u201cGood\u201d  \n     a. Debater_A labels all subjects \u201ctrying to do good,\u201d ignoring the author\u2019s examples of genuine abuse: Princess Diana\u2019s paparazzi (review \u00a73), Adm. Boorda\u2019s suicide under constant media hounding (ibid.), and possible wrongdoing in Whitewater (review \u00a710). The author does not suggest these are \u201cinnocent.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cCover Our Ears\u201d Equals Censorship  \n     a. Debater_A\u2019s view would require adopting Tannen\u2019s filtering: banning email, Lexis-Nexis, humorous political debate, and cross-examination (review \u00a7\u00a79\u201312). The author rejects these filters as paternalistic and dangerous to democracy. If journalism only \u201ctears down,\u201d why does he hungrily defend fierce debate and unfiltered communication?  \n  3. Author\u2019s Praise for War Metaphors and Scrutiny  \n     a. He explicitly praises \u201cwar\u201d and \u201cvigilance\u201d metaphors. A \u201ctear-down\u201d of the innocent would hardly merit such martial praise. He treats scrutiny as a prophylactic, not a destructive end in itself.  \n  4. Consequence of No Scrutiny: Gridlock and Obstruction  \n     a. He blames Tannen for conflating obstructionism with healthy debate (review \u00a73). Without investigation, gridlock worsens; power goes unchecked. His entire critique warns against stripping us of investigative tools.  \n\nIII. Logical Consistency & Authorial Intent  \n  1. Purpose of Journalism: Truth, Not Entertainment  \n     a. He says the First Amendment has become \u201ca pretext to justify \u2026 entertaining fights\u201d (review \u00a79), implying that true investigative journalism transcends mere spectacle and aims at accountability.  \n  2. Consensus vs. Debate  \n     a. He mocks Tannen\u2019s faith in \u201call reasonable people\u201d consensus (review \u00a79) and her desire to foreclose debate on abortion, global warming, and health care. If journalism merely \u201ctears down\u201d good-faith consensus, why champion debate on controversial matters? He sees debate as self-correcting only when journalism calls out abuse.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated endorsements of \u201cwar,\u201d \u201cvigilance,\u201d cross-examination, and adversarial models underscore his belief that investigative journalism\u2019s purpose is to stop abuses of power, not to \u201ctear down\u201d innocent benefactors. Rejecting censorship, authoritarian formats, and consensus-based filtering, he champions free, aggressive inquiry as democracy\u2019s vital defense.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTearing Down People Who Are Just Trying to Do Good\u201d\n\nI. The Author\u2019s Consistent Condemnation of Investigative Scrutiny\n\n1. \u201cTorture,\u201d \u201cCruel,\u201d and \u201cDirty Tricks\u201d  \n  \u2022 The author quotes Howard Kurtz et al. on  torturing Princess Diana  and driving Adm. Boorda to suicide\u201d by the \u201cmainstream press\u201d (background \u00b65). <quote> torturing Princess Diana </quote> and <quote> driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide.</quote> cannot describe a benevolent watchdog; they depict gratuitous harm to dignitaries.  \n  \u2022 She characterizes investigations of Espy, Elders, and Whitewater as \u201cexcessive,\u201d \u201ccruelly unfair,\u201d and \u201cthe nastiest \u2026 dirty tricks campaign\u201d (\u00b611). If journalism\u2019s goal were to \u201cstop abuses,\u201d it would not lament these probes.\n\n2. Advocacy of Information Suppression  \n  \u2022 She wants to \u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b614) and praises Asian \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d by rejecting \u201cdisputation\u201d (\u00b612).  \n  \u2022 She endorses single\u2010guest TV formats that eliminate adversarial questioning (\u00b612) and calls cross\u2010examination \u201cinhumane\u201d (\u00b613). These proposals curtail exposure of even genuine wrongdoing.\n\n3. Distrust of Public Competence  \n  \u2022 She asserts \u201cno evidence that people can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d (\u00b614), fearing \u201cinconsistencies\u201d surfaced by Lexis\u2010Nexis (\u00b69). If exposure were salutary, she would trust public judgment rather than advocate information control.\n\n4. Failure to Differentiate Innocents from Tyrants  \n  \u2022 Although in \u201csphere of struggle\u201d she acknowledges Saddam (\u00b66), she never exempts democratic leaders acting in public interest from critique. Her blanket demonization of \u201cargument culture\u201d collapses healthy scrutiny with \u201cbelligerence\u201d (\u00b63).  \n  \u2022 The very example of praising Safire\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d for inflation control is ideological, not journalistic: she criticizes \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in the press when used to describe Greenspan (\u00b65). The author distinguishes policy \u201cwar\u201d from media \u201cwar.\u201d\n\nII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cStopping Abuses\u201d Theory\n\n1. Misreading \u201cWar\u201d Metaphors  \n  \u2022 Debater_B conflates her praise for military \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d (\u00b66\u20137) with press behavior. Yet she deplores \u201cus versus them\u201d rhetoric by journalists as \u201cpoisonous\u201d (\u00b63) and \u201cpropaganda\u201d akin to totalitarian regimes (\u00b69).  \n  \u2022 If she truly saw press warfare as salutary, she would welcome \u201chit \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (\u00b65); instead she brands it \u201cbelligerent\u201d and destructive.\n\n2. Contradiction in Law Enforcement Analogy  \n  \u2022 She concedes necessity of lethal force against actual thugs (\u00b66) yet criticizes \u201cresistance to kill\u201d training for cops\u2014she laments the moral burden of killing, not the function of restraint. Her concern is with psychological \u201cloneliness\u201d in Vietnam (\u00b67), not the absence of oversight.  \n  \u2022 Her ignorance of \u201cfighting Hitler\u201d as the critical difference in WWII (\u00b67) demonstrates her attention to soldiers\u2019 morale, not the cause. Her focus is on emotional bonds (\u201csnuggle\u201d), not mission efficacy.\n\n3. Selective Trust in Consensus  \n  \u2022 She urges acceptance of \u201cbroad bipartisan and public consensus\u201d on abortion, climate change, health care (\u00b611) and deems \u201cview of government as the enemy\u201d \u201cnot worth debating\u201d (\u00b611). This is censorship of minority views, not exposure of abuse.  \n  \u2022 Investigative journalism is precisely the mechanism to challenge consensus groupthink, which she disparages.\n\n4. Authoritarian Alternatives Undermine Democracy  \n  \u2022 She cites French/German inquisitorial courts (\u00b613) where journalists and defense counsel are powerless. This model protects officials from public exposure, contradicting any \u201cabuse\u2010stopping\u201d rationale.\n\nIII. Logical Coherence with \u201cTearing Down\u201d Interpretation\n\n1. \u201cCover Our Ears\u201d as Censorship of Scrutiny  \n  \u2022 <quote> cover our ears,</quote> (\u00b614) is literal suppression of investigative voices.  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cFiltering out \u2026 debate\u201d</invalid_quote> (ibid.) precludes the very function of journalism in exposing corruption.\n\n2. Praise for Couples Counseling vs. National Debate  \n  \u2022 Her self\u2010help work (\u00b62) is restricted to \u201csnuggle\u201d contexts. Extending it to the \u201cwhole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (\u00b61) shows misapplication of interpersonal norms to public scrutiny, equating journalistic challenge with personal offense.\n\n3. Distrust of Cross\u2010Examination  \n  \u2022 Her objection to cross\u2010examining Anita Hill (\u00b613) and labeling it \u201cvexatious\u201d when Holocaust deniers are tried (\u00b613) shows her view that any adversarial exposure is undue cruelty. A true watchdog would value such exposure to prevent denial and cover\u2010ups.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery major prescription in Tannen\u2019s critique\u2014including eliminating adversarial formats, filtering debate, distrusting public discernment, and praising authoritarian models\u2014coheres only if investigative journalism is seen as \u201ctearing down\u201d public\u2010spirited actors rather than \u201cstopping abuses.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s selective reading of \u201cwar\u201d metaphors and analogies to military force misattributes to her an endorsement of press aggression. In fact, she seeks to restrain and suppress it. Therefore, the author\u2019s intent is to condemn investigative journalism\u2019s divisive tearing down of figures \u201ctrying to do good.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Reinforcing \u201cStopping Abuses\u201d Thesis  \n1. Authorial Praise for \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cVigilance\u201d  \n   a. The author endorses \u201cwar metaphors\u201d for Greenspan\u2019s fight: \u201cGood for us\u201d (quote \u00a75). He likens journalistic scrutiny to a prophylactic \u201ccombat\u201d against corruption. If he merely wanted to \u201ctear down,\u201d he would denounce such martial zeal.  \n   b. He insists \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation \u2026 safeguard[s] the country\u201d (ibid.), drawing an explicit parallel between economic \u201cwar\u201d and the necessity of investigative vigilance.  \n\n2. Defense of Adversarial Processes  \n   a. He defends the \u201cadversary system\u201d despite its \u201cvexatious experience\u201d (quote \u00a712). He applauds the Canadian hate\u2010speech trial of Holocaust deniers, acknowledging its cruelty but valuing its airing of facts. These are precisely the mechanisms that expose lies and prevent abuses.  \n   b. He rejects Tannen\u2019s paternalistic \u201ccover our ears\u201d approach to e\u2010mail and Lexis\u2010Nexis: \u201cTechnology \u2026 exacerbates the culture of critique\u201d (quote \u00a79). His objection signals that unfiltered scrutiny is preferable\u2014lest abuse go undetected.  \n\n3. Distinction Between Snuggle and Struggle  \n   a. He concedes a \u201csphere of struggle\u201d where \u201cthugs and tyrants\u201d must not be snuggled with (quote \u00a76). Democracy\u2019s leaders and institutions risk slide into tyranny if never challenged. His critique of Tannen\u2019s conflation of \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d with \u201cgridlock\u201d (quote \u00a73) shows he values vigorous inquiry even at the cost of temporary discord.  \n   b. He mocks Tannen\u2019s desire for \u201cconsensus\u201d on abortion, global warming, and health care, branding it \u201ctroubling\u201d to rule out \u201cview of government as the enemy\u201d (quote \u00a711). If debate only \u201ctears down,\u201d why champion open debate on such divisive issues?  \n\n4. Rejection of Authoritarian Alternatives  \n   a. He praises American norms of proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d versus French models where \u201cguilt \u2026 need not be established\u201d (quote \u00a713). He warns against a judge\u2019s \u201cintimate belief\u201d as chief arbiter, because it invites unchecked power\u2014precisely what investigative journalism guards against.  \n   b. He condemns single\u2010guest formats and restrictions on cross\u2010examination while underlining the American system\u2019s capacity to \u201ccorrect itself\u201d through adversarial methods (quote \u00a712).  \n\nII. Reply to Debater_A\u2019s Objections  \n1. \u201cHarms to Princess Diana and Adm. Boorda\u201d \u2013 Evidence of Abuse, Not Innocence  \n   a. These cases illustrate genuine press \u201cexcesses\u201d when standards slip, not a reason to abandon scrutiny entirely. The author\u2019s overarching thesis: maintain vigilance but avoid \u201coversimplify[ing]\u201d and \u201cnit-picking\u201d weak examples (quote \u00a73). He seeks disciplined scrutiny, not endless pageantry.  \n2. \u201cDesire to Filter E\u00admail and Lexis-Nexis\u201d \u2013 Paternalism as Critique, Not Prescription  \n   a. Tannen\u2019s call to \u201cfilter\u201d is exactly what the author rejects as \u201cpaternalistic\u201d (quote \u00a79). He frames her proposals as cautionary, not normative. His repeated defense of free debate indicates his true preference.  \n3. \u201cAdvocacy of Authoritarian Asian Models\u201d \u2013 Irony of Examples  \n   a. Tannen\u2019s references to Japanese one-guest shows and Chinese \u201cdecorum\u201d are presented as exotic curiosities. The author\u2019s tone is skeptical, and he explicitly asks \u201cIf so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country\u201d (quote \u00a712). This irony underscores his support for American open debate.  \n4. \u201cImmunity for Good-Faith Actors\u201d \u2013 Necessity of Oversight  \n   a. Democratic leaders, however \u201cpublic-spirited,\u201d may succumb to corruption (Watergate, Whitewater). Investigative journalism\u2019s role is analogous to law enforcement\u2019s \u201ctraining to kill\u201d in extreme cases (quote \u00a76). We tolerate discomfort to prevent greater harm.  \n\nIII. Logical Coherence and Authorial Intent  \n1. Goal: \u201cBuild your own\u201d rather than \u201cnit-pick\u201d (quote \u00a73) implies fair inquiry\u2014exposing actual misconduct, not trivial slurs.  \n2. \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle\u201d (quote \u00a73): The author advocates balanced, evidence-based investigation, not bias or sensationalism.  \n3. \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not \u2026 personal flaws\u201d (quote \u00a73): He would strip away irrelevant attacks and spotlight real abuses\u2014precisely investigative journalism\u2019s promise.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author champions investigative journalism as democracy\u2019s \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d against abuse\u2014endorsing \u201cwar metaphors,\u201d defending the adversarial system, rejecting paternalistic filters, and warning of authoritarian alternatives. His nuanced call to avoid \u201coversimplification\u201d and \u201cnit-picking\u201d signals quality control, not cancellation of scrutiny. The only plausible answer: investigative journalism \u201cstops people from abusing their power.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
