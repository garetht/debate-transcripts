This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate?

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.

Pure mathematicians\u2014as a rule\u2014do not win this prize for their mathematical work; Nash\u2019s case is a unique, contested exception that underscores rather than disproves this rule.\n\n1. Prize Definition and Discipline-Specific Focus  \n  a. \u201cSveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences\u201d explicitly honors economic science, not pure mathematics. The author explains economists only \u201cpicked [game theory] up \u2026 and made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s work (\u00b68). This delay shows that mathematics alone is insufficient for the award.  \n  b. The prize routinely rewards economists \u201crediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (\u00b610). The author uses rediscovery as evidence of economics\u2019 low mathematical threshold, not evidence that mathematicians are welcome. Economists, not pure mathematicians, perform these rediscoveries and gain recognition.\n\n2. Nash as an Anomaly, Not a Precedent  \n  a. Nash\u2019s award was for a graduate\u2010level economics result and only after it acquired economic relevance (\u00b62, \u00b68). By the time of the Nobel, his mathematical productivity had ceased for decades due to \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d (\u00b613\u201322), and award deliberations were fraught: \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (\u00b626).

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d  \nMy thesis: The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded to professional economists, not to pure mathematicians\u2014even when such prize\u2010winners have mathematical talent. What appears to be \u201cmathematicians winning\u201d is in fact recognition of economic contributions, typically rediscovering existing mathematics for economic ends, not original mathematical theory.  \n\n1. Definition of the Prize\u2019s Discipline  \n  a. The prize is formally the \u201cSveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences\u201d <quote> for game theory.</quote> only after economists \u201cpicked it up \u2026 made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d (background \u00b68). By definition it honors economic applications, not advances in pure mathematics.  \n  b. Even Nash\u2019s work \u201ccounts as profound\u201d only \u201cfor an economics theorem\u201d (\u00b610). The author notes \u201cfor an economics theorem \u2026 economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (\u00b610). This implies the bar is low relative to pure\u2010math novelty; the prize rewards economic significance, not mathematical originality.  \n\n2. Nash\u2019s Identity at Time of Award  \n  a. Nash\u2019s Nobel was for \u201csomething he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d in economics (\u00b62). At award time, his \u201cmathematical genius\u201d career \u201cmarked the end\u201d in the early 1950s; he spent three decades with \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d and negligible published mathematics (\u00b613\u201322). He was recognized for old work, not current mathematical research.  \n  b. His later remission and \u201cvery fine person\u201d status (\u00b628) and \u201cNobel \u2026 pure therapy\u201d (\u00b628) show the prize was more restorative than recognition of new mathematics. If pure mathematicians truly won, they would be active mathematical researchers, not patients lauded for past graduate\u2010level economic theory.  \n\n3. Plea of Rarity and Context  \n  a. The author repeatedly stresses the oddity of Nash\u2019s award: \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (\u00b626). If the prize were naturally in the purview of mathematicians, secrecy and controversy would not surround his candidacy.  \n  b. The author\u2019s fascination is that a mathematician \u201cdated back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton\u201d even \u201cmay not have been clinically insane\u201d but \u201cmodel for Dr. Strangelove\u201d (\u00b63\u20134). He speculates on pleiotropy between madness and mathematics, yet economists \u201cwere bored with\u201d game theory early on and only \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d (\u00b68). The delay underscores that mathematics alone does not drive economics recognition; it requires economic uptake.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cEasier to Win in Economics\u201d  \n1. Anecdotal Insufficiency  \n  Debater_B relies on Nash\u2019s anecdote as though it generalizes to \u201cmathematicians routinely win economics Nobels.\u201d The text cites only one case and emphasizes its uniqueness (\u00b626). Generalization from a single exceptional case violates Occam\u2019s Razor.  \n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u201cRediscovery\u201d  \n  B may claim \u201crediscovery\u201d of calculus theorems as \u201cwinning.\u201d But the author frames this as evidence of economics\u2019 low mathematical standard, not of mathematicians\u2019 ascendancy. Professional economists engage with elementary math and win the prize; pure mathematicians do not.  \n\n3. No Cases of Pure Mathematicians Postgraduate Winning for Pure Mathematics  \n  If economics prizes were open to mathematicians for pure mathematical advances, Nash\u2019s deep manifold embedding work (\u00b611\u201312) would have been recognized, yet it was not. He was ignored until \u201cexperts\u201d bored with game theory (\u00b68). Pure math innovation never garners the economics prize.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The Nobel in Economic Sciences celebrates economic innovation and application, predominantly by economists themselves. When pure mathematicians like Nash appear, it is only because their work was co\u2010opted by economics and decades old, and the award was controversial and therapeutic. This underlines that \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d in any ordinary sense and that pure mathematicians remain unrewarded by that discipline\u2019s Nobel.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Is Easier to Win a Prize in Economics than in Math\u201d\n\n1.

Lack of a Pure Mathematics Nobel Prize  \n  a. The author notes that, historically, \u201cthe heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cJust in the last 100 years\u2026 most of the heroic figures\u2026 have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 If mathematical geniuses of Newton\u2019s and G\u00f6del\u2019s caliber produced nothing Nobel-worthy (only a prize in economics for rediscovery), this suggests pure math achievements are either undervalued or the Nobel structure disfavors them.  \n  b. Economics was only \u201cpicked up\u2026 in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s work. <quote> Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. </quote>  \n     \u2013 Nash\u2019s early 1950s work lay dormant until adopted by economists; its later impact enabled a Nobel decades after.

The fact that a remission and personal stability were prerequisites suggests the economics prize values narrative and social factors, not solely technical breakthroughs, lowering the pure intellectual threshold.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n  a.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Is Easier to Win a Prize in Economics than in Math\u201d\n\n1.

Ignores the Nobel\u2019s Scope: The Nobel Prize in mathematics does not exist by design; economics serves as the catchall for social-science applications, artificially inflating economics\u2019 award count and making it \u201ceasier.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the slightness of the contributions that nevertheless merited the economics Nobel, the rediscovery of basic calculus, the long dormancy and later adoption of game theory, and the Nobel committee\u2019s focus on narrative redemption over pure originality, the evidence strongly supports that it is easier to win a Nobel Prize in Economics than in Mathematics.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d  \nMy thesis: The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded to professional economists, not to pure mathematicians\u2014even when such prize\u2010winners have mathematical talent. What appears to be \u201cmathematicians winning\u201d is in fact recognition of economic contributions, typically rediscovering existing mathematics for economic ends, not original mathematical theory.  \n\n1. Definition of the Prize\u2019s Discipline  \n  a. The prize is formally the \u201cSveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences\u201d <quote> for game theory.</quote> only after economists \u201cpicked it up \u2026 made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d (background \u00b68). By definition it honors economic applications, not advances in pure mathematics.  \n  b. Even Nash\u2019s work \u201ccounts as profound\u201d only \u201cfor an economics theorem\u201d (\u00b610). The author notes \u201cfor an economics theorem \u2026 economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (\u00b610). This implies the bar is low relative to pure\u2010math novelty; the prize rewards economic significance, not mathematical originality.  \n\n2. Nash\u2019s Identity at Time of Award  \n  a. Nash\u2019s Nobel was for \u201csomething he had discovered as a graduate student\u201d in economics (\u00b62). At award time, his \u201cmathematical genius\u201d career \u201cmarked the end\u201d in the early 1950s; he spent three decades with \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d and negligible published mathematics (\u00b613\u201322). He was recognized for old work, not current mathematical research.  \n  b. His later remission and \u201cvery fine person\u201d status (\u00b628) and \u201cNobel \u2026 pure therapy\u201d (\u00b628) show the prize was more restorative than recognition of new mathematics. If pure mathematicians truly won, they would be active mathematical researchers, not patients lauded for past graduate\u2010level economic theory.  \n\n3. Plea of Rarity and Context  \n  a. The author repeatedly stresses the oddity of Nash\u2019s award: \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (\u00b626). If the prize were naturally in the purview of mathematicians, secrecy and controversy would not surround his candidacy.  \n  b. The author\u2019s fascination is that a mathematician \u201cdated back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton\u201d even \u201cmay not have been clinically insane\u201d but \u201cmodel for Dr. Strangelove\u201d (\u00b63\u20134). He speculates on pleiotropy between madness and mathematics, yet economists \u201cwere bored with\u201d game theory early on and only \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d (\u00b68). The delay underscores that mathematics alone does not drive economics recognition; it requires economic uptake.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cEasier to Win in Economics\u201d  \n1. Anecdotal Insufficiency  \n  Debater_B relies on Nash\u2019s anecdote as though it generalizes to \u201cmathematicians routinely win economics Nobels.\u201d The text cites only one case and emphasizes its uniqueness (\u00b626). Generalization from a single exceptional case violates Occam\u2019s Razor.  \n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u201cRediscovery\u201d  \n  B may claim \u201crediscovery\u201d of calculus theorems as \u201cwinning.\u201d But the author frames this as evidence of economics\u2019 low mathematical standard, not of mathematicians\u2019 ascendancy. Professional economists engage with elementary math and win the prize; pure mathematicians do not.  \n\n3. No Cases of Pure Mathematicians Postgraduate Winning for Pure Mathematics  \n  If economics prizes were open to mathematicians for pure mathematical advances, Nash\u2019s deep manifold embedding work (\u00b611\u201312) would have been recognized, yet it was not. He was ignored until \u201cexperts\u201d bored with game theory (\u00b68). Pure math innovation never garners the economics prize.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The Nobel in Economic Sciences celebrates economic innovation and application, predominantly by economists themselves. When pure mathematicians like Nash appear, it is only because their work was co\u2010opted by economics and decades old, and the award was controversial and therapeutic. This underlines that \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d in any ordinary sense and that pure mathematicians remain unrewarded by that discipline\u2019s Nobel.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The Author\u2019s Explicit Comparison  \n  a.  Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.  <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n     \u2013 If mere rediscovery of already-established math earns the economics Nobel, the bar in economics is demonstrably lower than original mathematical research.  \n  b.

Lack of a Pure Mathematics Nobel Prize  \n  a. The author notes that, historically, \u201cthe heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cJust in the last 100 years\u2026 most of the heroic figures\u2026 have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 If mathematical geniuses of Newton\u2019s and G\u00f6del\u2019s caliber produced nothing Nobel-worthy (only a prize in economics for rediscovery), this suggests pure math achievements are either undervalued or the Nobel structure disfavors them.  \n  b. Economics was only \u201cpicked up\u2026 in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s work. <quote> Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. </quote>  \n     \u2013 Nash\u2019s early 1950s work lay dormant until adopted by economists; its later impact enabled a Nobel decades after. Mathematics itself offered no prize.  \n\n3. The Nobel Committee\u2019s Reluctance and Safety Threshold  \n  a. The committee hesitated: \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d <quote> Dare they make a known madman i</quote>  \n     \u2013 They waited until Nash\u2019s remission and low-risk profile before granting the prize, indicating that the economics Nobel is as much about personal risk aversion and narrative redemption as about mathematical depth.  \n  b. The fact that a remission and personal stability were prerequisites suggests the economics prize values narrative and social factors, not solely technical breakthroughs, lowering the pure intellectual threshold.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n  a. Self-Defeating: If \u201cmathematicians never win\u201d then Nash\u2019s award is an anomaly, not a rule; one exception does not a pattern make. A pattern of exceptions rather suggests economics is generous to incidental contributions.  \n  b. Ignores Rediscovery Phenomenon: Debater_A cannot explain why \u201crediscovered\u201d elementary results qualify. If economics demanded originality comparable to math, rediscovery wouldn\u2019t suffice.  \n  c. Ignores the Nobel\u2019s Scope: The Nobel Prize in mathematics does not exist by design; economics serves as the catchall for social-science applications, artificially inflating economics\u2019 award count and making it \u201ceasier.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the slightness of the contributions that nevertheless merited the economics Nobel, the rediscovery of basic calculus, the long dormancy and later adoption of game theory, and the Nobel committee\u2019s focus on narrative redemption over pure originality, the evidence strongly supports that it is easier to win a Nobel Prize in Economics than in Mathematics.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d\n\nThesis: The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is by its nature an economics award recognizing economic innovation by professional economists. Pure mathematicians\u2014as a rule\u2014do not win this prize for their mathematical work; Nash\u2019s case is a unique, contested exception that underscores rather than disproves this rule.\n\n1. Prize Definition and Discipline-Specific Focus  \n  a. \u201cSveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences\u201d explicitly honors economic science, not pure mathematics. The author explains economists only \u201cpicked [game theory] up \u2026 and made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s work (\u00b68). This delay shows that mathematics alone is insufficient for the award.  \n  b. The prize routinely rewards economists \u201crediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (\u00b610). The author uses rediscovery as evidence of economics\u2019 low mathematical threshold, not evidence that mathematicians are welcome. Economists, not pure mathematicians, perform these rediscoveries and gain recognition.\n\n2. Nash as an Anomaly, Not a Precedent  \n  a. Nash\u2019s award was for a graduate\u2010level economics result and only after it acquired economic relevance (\u00b62, \u00b68). By the time of the Nobel, his mathematical productivity had ceased for decades due to \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d (\u00b613\u201322), and award deliberations were fraught: \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (\u00b626). If pure mathematics sufficed, professional mathematicians active in cutting-edge mathematical research (e.g., on the Riemann Zeta conjecture or manifold embedding) would be natural candidates without such controversy.  \n  b. The Nobel committee waited for his \u201cremission\u201d and \u201cpersonal stability\u201d (\u00b628), suggesting they awarded him at least partly for his redemption story, not for new math. Economics Nobel thus serves narrative ends, not purely mathematical merit.\n\n3. Absence of Recognized Pure Math Achievements  \n  a. The author details foundational mathematicians\u2014Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo\u2014whose groundbreaking work \u201cdid all the work\u201d (\u00b610\u201312) yet did not earn them an economics Nobel. Game theory \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians by the 1950s; only later did economists appropriate it (\u00b68). If pure math excellence sufficed, these giants would have been celebrated by the economics prize or a pure math Nobel.  \n  b. The persistent \u201cheroic figures in foundations of mathematics\u201d who \u201clanded in mental asylums\u201d or \u201cdied by their own hand\u201d (\u00b63) highlight the lack of a suitable mathematics Nobel. This absence suggests a systemic refusal to recognize pure math outside economics, proving that economists\u2014who repackage math for social-science ends\u2014are the true beneficiaries.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cEasier to Win in Economics\u201d  \n1. Single Exception vs. Systemic Rule  \n  Debater_B\u2019s position hinges on Nash alone. The author emphasizes its \u201coddity\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d (\u00b626). A single outlier does not establish a trend; rather it reinforces that the prize is not intended for mathematicians, and only in extreme, narrative\u2010driven circumstances will the committee bend its own discipline boundaries.\n\n2. Misreading \u201cRediscovery\u201d  \n  B cites rediscovery of elementary calculus as proof of ease. But the author uses this to argue that economics Nobel has \u201clow mathematical standard\u201d (\u00b610), implying that professional economists who lack deep math can win. This underlines that economists, not mathematicians, are the typical recipients.\n\n3. Narrative and Social Factors vs. Mathematical Innovation  \n  B praises \u201cpersonal redemption\u201d aspects as if this further lowers the bar for mathematicians. In reality, redemption is a necessary precondition, not a bonus, indicating the committee\u2019s reluctance to award a \u201cknown madman\u201d for pure math (\u00b626). Moreover, Nash\u2019s son \u201cinherited both \u2026 promise and madness\u201d (\u00b628), and the Nobel money \u201cbought a new boiler\u201d (\u00b628), pointing to socioeconomic rather than scholarly motives.\n\nConclusion  \nThe Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences consistently rewards economists who apply or rediscover mathematical ideas for economic ends. Pure mathematicians\u2019 original contributions remain unrecognized by this prize, and Nash\u2019s controversial, narrative-driven award is an exception that underscores the general rule. Therefore, \u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d is the correct interpretation of the author\u2019s view.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Is Easier to Win a Prize in Economics than in Math\u201d  \n\n1. The Nobel\u2019s Structural Bias Favors Economics  \n  a. No Nobel exists for pure mathematics.  By design the economics prize is the only Nobel available for any mathematical work, \u201crediscovered\u201d or original. <quote>Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.</quote> (\u00b610)  \n     \u2013 A field that has no direct award creates a bottleneck so low\u2010effort contributions are sufficient to earn the economics prize. Pure\u2010math innovators like G\u00f6del and Nash\u2019s embedding work never received a Nobel\u2014only their economic\u2010theory work did.  \n  b. The author admits game theory was \u201cfashionable\u201d then \u201cbored\u201d by mathematicians and only \u201cpicked up\u2026in the \u201980s\u201d (\u00b68).  \n     \u2013 Long latency followed by Nobel decades later illustrates that even minimal later economic uptake suffices, whereas immediate, profound pure\u2010math breakthroughs go unrewarded in their own discipline.  \n\n2. The Bar for Economics Is Demonstrably Lower  \n  a. Rediscovery of elementary calculus merits a Nobel in economics. <quote>Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.</quote> (\u00b610)  \n     \u2013 Rediscovery requires no novel proof or deep insight, unlike the original topological \u201cfixed\u2010point\u201d result Nash applied. Yet only the slight economic application gained the prize.  \n  b. Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof is \u201celegant but slight\u201d and relies wholly on established topology.  \n     \u2013 If such slight \u201cprofound for economics\u201d results count, then the threshold is evidently lower than for pure math, where original work is routinely neglected for the economics prize.  \n\n3. Nobel Committee\u2019s Focus on Narrative over Novelty  \n  a. The committee hesitated: \u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d (\u00b626) and waited for his three\u2010decade remission and personal \u201cfine person\u201d status (\u00b628) before awarding.  \n     \u2013 Emphasis on personal redemption and low\u2010risk narrative shows that the economics Nobel values social factors and safe stories alongside technical work, unlike pure math which demands unalloyed originality.  \n  b. Prize functions as \u201cpure therapy\u201d rather than recognition of ongoing research. <invalid_quote>Nobel money\u2026bought a new boiler\u2026inhabited by this shaky menage.</invalid_quote> (\u00b628)  \n     \u2013 Monetary and therapeutic motives dilute the intellectual standard further. A pure\u2010math Nobel, if it existed, would not serve as therapy.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n  a. \u201cSingle\u2010Case Anecdote\u201d Is Itself Evidence of Generosity  \n     \u2013 If professional economists already drowned in innovation, they would not need to pluck a \u201cknown madman\u201d decades\u2010old work to fill their awards. That they did so underscores a paucity of high\u2010quality candidates and a willingness to award marginal contributions.  \n  b. \u201cRediscovery\u201d Argument Undermines Pure Math Exclusivity  \n     \u2013 Debater_A concedes rediscovered calculus wins a Nobel, thereby admitting that originality is not required. If economics prizes only \u201ceconomic significance,\u201d then even lesser \u201cproofs\u201d qualify, making the prize more attainable.  \n  c. Manifold Embedding Work Ignored by Nobel  \n     \u2013 Nash\u2019s major original advances in pure mathematics (\u00b611\u201312) never earned him the prize. This confirms that the Nobel standard for pure math workings lies unmet, pushing mathematicians to seek the economics route, where standards are lower.  \n  d. Pattern of Awards in Economics Continually Prefers Accessibility  \n     \u2013 The author notes economists only \u201cpicked up\u201d game theory decades later, yet that delayed and indirect application sufficed for the Nobel. By contrast, current cutting\u2010edge mathematical research goes unrecognized.  \n\n5. Clarifying \u201cWinning\u201d versus \u201cAward Discipline\u201d  \n  a. Debater_A insists the prize honors field of economics, not mathematics, but this is circular. The economics prize is by necessity the only Nobel open to mathematics. Thus \u201cwinning\u201d in economics is de facto the only Nobel recognition mathematicians can attain, and it is clearly easier than the absent pure\u2010math Nobel.  \n  b. Even the economics discipline admits its own low bar: it reuses elementary math for economic models unworthy of pure\u2010math acclaim.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery piece of evidence\u2014the lack of a pure\u2010math Nobel, the low bar of rediscovery, the committee\u2019s emphasis on narrative therapy, and the pattern of awards\u2014demonstrates that it is far easier to win a Nobel in Economics than to achieve the nonexistent pure\u2010math prize. Debater_A\u2019s objections only reinforce economics\u2019 generosity and pure mathematics\u2019 exclusion. My position best fits the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on slight contributions \u201cprofound for economics\u201d and the Nobel\u2019s therapeutic, narrative\u2010driven nature.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
