{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 263, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

I maintain that the article\u2019s purpose is to \u201caddress the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculate upon whether those views are accurate,\u201d not merely to single out Monica Lewinsky.  \n\n  A. Scope of \u201cScorecard\u201d  \n    1. The author presents a \u201cSlate rating\u201d for 31 \u201ckey players\u201d (<quote>entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>), from Bill Clinton to Chelsea Clinton.  \n    2. Each entry systematically lists minuses and pluses, weighing public favorability against the author\u2019s moral recalibration (\u201cAnything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card.\u201d).  \n    3. The very existence of so many entries shows the article\u2019s ambition: to recalibrate public sympathy across the board, not only for Lewinsky.  \n\n  B. Repeated Theme of \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d  \n    1. The article begins by arguing sympathy for Betty Currie may be misplaced (<quote> Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent </quote>) and calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration.\u201d  \n    2. It then says Monica\u2019s public rating is \u201cfantastically low\u201d but recognizes mitigating factors (<invalid_quote>\u201cshe was also sexually exploited\u2026 betrayed\u2026 hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n    3. The pattern repeats for each player: evaluating whether public admiration or condemnation is justified.  \n\n  C. The Title and Framing  \n    1. The title \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d implies a broad struggle over blame among many participants, not a singular focus on Monica.  \n    2. The opening line: \u201cOne of the few truths \u2026 acknowledged about Flytrap is that \u2026 Betty Currie deserves our sympathy\u201d sets up a series of symmetry arguments (\u201cOthers besides Currie have benefited from the public\u2019s excessive generosity,\u201d \u201cSometimes, of course, the public\u2019s rating is dead on target.\u201d).  \n    3. The repeated contrast between \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d and \u201cSlate rating\u201d underscores the article\u2019s comparative, inclusive approach.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s narrow summary (\u201cSlate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky \u2026 was disproportionately shamed\u201d) is inadequate:  \n\n  A. Ignores majority of content  \n    1. Over 90% of the scorecard evaluates persons other than Monica: e.g., Bill Clinton, Dick Morris, Linda Tripp, Stephanopoulos, the Media, Secret Service, Chelsea Clinton, etc.  \n    2. The author invests far more space listing and commenting on others\u2019 blameworthiness or sympathy.  \n\n  B. Neglects the declared methodology  \n    1. The author states: \u201cThis is not, of course, an exact science \u2026 You decide\u201d (<quote> Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.)</quote>), inviting readers to apply the same process to all.  \n    2. The public\u2019s \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d or \u201ccontempt\u201d is repeatedly interrogated across multiple persons.  \n\n  C. Overstates focus on Lewinsky  \n    1. The Lewinsky section is one among many and explicitly parallels the Currie discussion.  \n    2. The phrasing \u201cNow, Monica certainly isn't the heroine \u2026 But \u2026 she hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNow, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap \u2026 she hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d</invalid_quote>) mirrors the broader strategy of sympathetic recalibration.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n  A. The article\u2019s central objective is panoramic: to challenge public judgments across the entire scandal, illustrated by a comprehensive \u201cScorecard.\u201d  \n  B. My answer best captures the author\u2019s repeated, explicit mandate for \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of all participants, not a mono-thematic attack on Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.  \n  C. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation is too reductive and conflicts with the article\u2019s framing, methodology, and scale.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position captures the article\u2019s central thrust: it calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d because \u201cMonica Lewinsky . . . hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d when compared to other participants.\n\n   a. <quote> Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap.</quote> shows Slate concedes some misbehavior by Lewinsky yet immediately follows with <invalid_quote>\u201cBut she was also sexually exploited . . . She hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background, para.2).  \n   b. The stark poll data (<quote>ne poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent </quote>) contrasts with the far higher public ratings of other key players (e.g., Chelsea Clinton at +10, Secret Service at +8, Betty Currie at +8). This mismatch is the \u201cproblem\u201d the author urges us to correct.  \n   c. The title \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d and the \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d remark immediately after mentioning Currie set up repeated \u201cfor example\u201d discussions, debuting with Lewinsky as the paradigmatic victim of excessive shaming.  \n\n2. Slate\u2019s scorecard fine-tunes sympathy and blame for each player, but Lewinsky\u2019s case is singled out for special attention:\n\n   a. She is one of only two participants (with Currie) discussed narratively before the scorecard.  \n   b. The narrative emphasis on her exploitation, betrayal by Tripp, and smear campaign underscores Slate\u2019s conviction that public opprobrium is excessive.  \n   c. Other low-rated actors (e.g., Linda Tripp at -7, Dick Morris at -7) receive no such narrative sympathy, nor does the article show empathy for them.  \n\n3. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s summary (\u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved\u201d) is overbroad and misses the castigation of extreme public views:\n\n   a. If the article merely cataloged public opinion, why invoke \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d (<quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. </quote>, para.1) unless to shift sympathy toward underdogs like Lewinsky?  \n   b. The narrative voice repeatedly criticizes public hypocrisy (<quote> excessive generosity.</quote> toward Stephanopoulos, e.g.) but reserves most vigorous defense only for Currie and Lewinsky. A neutral survey would treat all entries equally.  \n   c. Slate\u2019s author devotes far more words to justifying why Lewinsky and Currie \u201chardly deserve contempt\u201d than to justifying negative scores for others. That editorial imbalance proves advocacy, not neutral \u201caddressing.\u201d  \n\n4. Logical coherence: An article genuinely summarizing public views would not:\n\n   a. Preemptively argue two individuals deserve more sympathy.  \n   b. Use narrative sections only for Currie and Lewinsky (\u201cfor example\u201d).  \n   c. Apply evaluative \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d selectively.  \n\nTherefore, the article\u2019s structure and tone demonstrate that Slate\u2019s real aim is to spotlight Lewinsky\u2019s disproportionate shaming and call for a correction of public judgment, confirming my option as the best summary.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Slate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

My position captures the article\u2019s central thrust: it calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d because \u201cMonica Lewinsky . . . hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d when compared to other participants.\n\n   a. <quote> Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap.</quote> shows Slate concedes some misbehavior by Lewinsky yet immediately follows with <invalid_quote>\u201cBut she was also sexually exploited . . . She hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background, para.2).  \n   b. The stark poll data (<quote>ne poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent </quote>) contrasts with the far higher public ratings of other key players (e.g., Chelsea Clinton at +10, Secret Service at +8, Betty Currie at +8). This mismatch is the \u201cproblem\u201d the author urges us to correct.  \n   c. The title \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d and the \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d remark immediately after mentioning Currie set up repeated \u201cfor example\u201d discussions, debuting with Lewinsky as the paradigmatic victim of excessive shaming.  \n\n2. Slate\u2019s scorecard fine-tunes sympathy and blame for each player, but Lewinsky\u2019s case is singled out for special attention:\n\n   a. She is one of only two participants (with Currie) discussed narratively before the scorecard.  \n   b. The narrative emphasis on her exploitation, betrayal by Tripp, and smear campaign underscores Slate\u2019s conviction that public opprobrium is excessive.  \n   c. Other low-rated actors (e.g., Linda Tripp at -7, Dick Morris at -7) receive no such narrative sympathy, nor does the article show empathy for them.  \n\n3. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s summary (\u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved\u201d) is overbroad and misses the castigation of extreme public views:\n\n   a. If the article merely cataloged public opinion, why invoke \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d (<quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. </quote>, para.1) unless to shift sympathy toward underdogs like Lewinsky?  \n   b. The narrative voice repeatedly criticizes public hypocrisy (<quote> excessive generosity.</quote> toward Stephanopoulos, e.g.) but reserves most vigorous defense only for Currie and Lewinsky. A neutral survey would treat all entries equally.  \n   c. Slate\u2019s author devotes far more words to justifying why Lewinsky and Currie \u201chardly deserve contempt\u201d than to justifying negative scores for others. That editorial imbalance proves advocacy, not neutral \u201caddressing.\u201d  \n\n4. Logical coherence: An article genuinely summarizing public views would not:\n\n   a. Preemptively argue two individuals deserve more sympathy.  \n   b. Use narrative sections only for Currie and Lewinsky (\u201cfor example\u201d).  \n   c. Apply evaluative \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d selectively.  \n\nTherefore, the article\u2019s structure and tone demonstrate that Slate\u2019s real aim is to spotlight Lewinsky\u2019s disproportionate shaming and call for a correction of public judgment, confirming my option as the best summary.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. I maintain that the article\u2019s purpose is to \u201caddress the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculate upon whether those views are accurate,\u201d not merely to single out Monica Lewinsky.  \n\n  A. Scope of \u201cScorecard\u201d  \n    1. The author presents a \u201cSlate rating\u201d for 31 \u201ckey players\u201d (<quote>entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>), from Bill Clinton to Chelsea Clinton.  \n    2. Each entry systematically lists minuses and pluses, weighing public favorability against the author\u2019s moral recalibration (\u201cAnything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card.\u201d).  \n    3. The very existence of so many entries shows the article\u2019s ambition: to recalibrate public sympathy across the board, not only for Lewinsky.  \n\n  B. Repeated Theme of \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d  \n    1. The article begins by arguing sympathy for Betty Currie may be misplaced (<quote> Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent </quote>) and calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration.\u201d  \n    2. It then says Monica\u2019s public rating is \u201cfantastically low\u201d but recognizes mitigating factors (<invalid_quote>\u201cshe was also sexually exploited\u2026 betrayed\u2026 hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n    3. The pattern repeats for each player: evaluating whether public admiration or condemnation is justified.  \n\n  C. The Title and Framing  \n    1. The title \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d implies a broad struggle over blame among many participants, not a singular focus on Monica.  \n    2. The opening line: \u201cOne of the few truths \u2026 acknowledged about Flytrap is that \u2026 Betty Currie deserves our sympathy\u201d sets up a series of symmetry arguments (\u201cOthers besides Currie have benefited from the public\u2019s excessive generosity,\u201d \u201cSometimes, of course, the public\u2019s rating is dead on target.\u201d).  \n    3. The repeated contrast between \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d and \u201cSlate rating\u201d underscores the article\u2019s comparative, inclusive approach.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s narrow summary (\u201cSlate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky \u2026 was disproportionately shamed\u201d) is inadequate:  \n\n  A. Ignores majority of content  \n    1. Over 90% of the scorecard evaluates persons other than Monica: e.g., Bill Clinton, Dick Morris, Linda Tripp, Stephanopoulos, the Media, Secret Service, Chelsea Clinton, etc.  \n    2. The author invests far more space listing and commenting on others\u2019 blameworthiness or sympathy.  \n\n  B. Neglects the declared methodology  \n    1. The author states: \u201cThis is not, of course, an exact science \u2026 You decide\u201d (<quote> Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.)</quote>), inviting readers to apply the same process to all.  \n    2. The public\u2019s \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d or \u201ccontempt\u201d is repeatedly interrogated across multiple persons.  \n\n  C. Overstates focus on Lewinsky  \n    1. The Lewinsky section is one among many and explicitly parallels the Currie discussion.  \n    2. The phrasing \u201cNow, Monica certainly isn't the heroine \u2026 But \u2026 she hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNow, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap \u2026 she hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d</invalid_quote>) mirrors the broader strategy of sympathetic recalibration.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n  A. The article\u2019s central objective is panoramic: to challenge public judgments across the entire scandal, illustrated by a comprehensive \u201cScorecard.\u201d  \n  B. My answer best captures the author\u2019s repeated, explicit mandate for \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of all participants, not a mono-thematic attack on Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.  \n  C. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation is too reductive and conflicts with the article\u2019s framing, methodology, and scale.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Slate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

My summary reflects the article\u2019s stated mission: \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of *all* Flytrap participants against their public ratings, not merely a plea for Monica.  \n\n   A. Explicit Invitation to Reevaluate Everyone  \n      1. The author opens with Betty Currie and then says \u201cSometimes, of course, the public\u2019s rating is dead on target,\u201d signaling successive applications of the same lens (Background, paras.1\u20132).  \n      2. The \u201centire scorecard\u201d of \u201c31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote>entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players</quote>) demonstrates a systematic, comparative exercise. A narrow Lewinsky-centric view cannot explain why neutral or even positive figures (e.g., Chelsea Clinton at +10, Secret Service at +5) are assessed.  \n      3. The author repeatedly uses standardized \u201cMinuses\u201d and \u201cPluses\u201d sections for each entry, inviting readers to weigh public vs. authorial judgments (\u201cAnything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card.\u201d). This method is incompatible with the notion of selective advocacy.  \n\n   B. Narrative \u201cExamples\u201d Serve as Templates, Not Exclusive Focus  \n      1. Currie appears before Lewinsky (<quote>But does Currie deserve such sanctification?</quote>), showing the template of \u201cpublic sympathy may be misplaced\u201d applies to any unfairly lauded aide. Only after establishing the pattern does the author introduce Lewinsky to show symmetrical overreaction\u2014but the pattern continues for others.  \n      2. Debater_B\u2019s claim that only two narrative treatments implies exclusivity ignores the footnotes: e.g., Mike McCurry (<invalid_quote>was clearly dismayed \u2026 quitting</invalid_quote>), Kathleen Willey, Ann Lewis\u2014all receive textual commentary beyond mere scores.  \n\n   C. Title and Framing Preclude Monothematic Reading  \n      1. \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d conveys a contest among *many* players over blame and sympathy, not a single-lens reframing of Lewinsky.  \n      2. The author\u2019s admission \u201cThis is not, of course, an exact science \u2026 You decide\u201d (<quote>Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.</quote>) underscores the impartial framework extended to all. A propagandistic article would not disclaim precision and pass judgment back to the reader.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s narrow Lewinsky thesis fails key tests:  \n\n   A. Disproportionate Content Ratio  \n      1. The Lewinsky section is roughly one paragraph in background before an even-handed numeric entry: contrast that with Bill Clinton\u2019s eight-item \u201cMinuses\u201d plus two-item \u201cPluses\u201d (<invalid_quote>To recapitulate \u2026 Did not have the grace \u2026</invalid_quote>). The author clearly devotes greater space to the president\u2019s misdeeds, evidencing genuine breadth.  \n      2. Numerous other negative figures (e.g., Linda Tripp at -7, Dick Morris at -7) are *not* sympathetically reframed, consistent only if the author\u2019s goal is general recalibration, not solely Lewinsky defense.  \n\n   B. \u201cSelective Sympathy\u201d Explained by Recalibration Spectrum  \n      1. The author decries both \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d (to Stephanopoulos, Carville) and \u201cexcessive contempt\u201d (to Lewinsky, Currie). This symmetrical critique of public extremes confirms that Lewinsky\u2019s treatment is just one test case.  \n      2. Debater_B\u2019s insistence on narrative sympathy for Lewinsky ignores the author\u2019s urging of sympathy for Paula Jones (+1) and Rep. Bob Barr (0)\u2014\u201cVindicated because Clinton probably did it\u201d and \u201cconsistent impeachment push\u201d respectively\u2014showing the author applies \u201csympathy rebalancing\u201d where \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d misaligns with \u201cSlate rating.\u201d  \n\n   C. Textual \u201cExamples\u201d as Illustration, Not Prescription  \n      1. The phrase \u201cfor example\u201d before Currie and Lewinsky (<quote>Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity</quote>) signals that these are illustrative cases, not the sum total of analysis.  \n      2. The scorecard\u2019s concluding entries (e.g., Chelsea Clinton) require no defense\u2014they validate the method\u2019s comprehensive sweep by showing the author\u2019s willingness to credit innocent victims beyond Lewinsky.  \n\n3. Logical Coherence and Authorial Tone  \n\n   A. Impartial Tone with Recusal of Absolute Authority  \n      1. By stating \u201cYou decide,\u201d the author refuses to impose conclusions, typical of a survey, not an op-ed pushing a single victim narrative.  \n      2. The \u201cScale runs from -10 to +10\u201d invites granular judgment across a spectrum of loyalty, deception, exploitation, humiliation\u2014far too nuanced to reduce to a sole focus on Monica.  \n\n   B. Balanced Criticism of Public Hypocrisy  \n      1. The author criticizes both \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d and \u201chypocritical contempt\u201d (e.g., the American people +1 but \u201csecretly fascinated\u201d by sleaze). This equidistance underscores a holistic project.  \n\nConclusion  \nMy answer best captures the article\u2019s broad evaluative project: a deliberate, methodical reassessment of *every* participant\u2019s moral standing relative to public perception, urging readers to apply the same \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d across the board. Debater_B\u2019s Lewinsky-centric summary cannot account for the article\u2019s comprehensive scorecard, impartial methodology, and repeated symmetrical appeals to rebalance *all* public judgments.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My \u201cLewinsky\u2010focus\u201d summary aligns with the article\u2019s narrative structure, language, and emphasis. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpanoramic\u201d view ignores how Slate foregrounds only Currie and Lewinsky in the narrative before the scorecard.  \n   A. <quote> for example,</quote> marker  \n     \u2022 Para.1: Currie is introduced, then <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. </quote>  \n     \u2022 Para.2: \u201cMonica Lewinsky\u2026 But she was also\u2026 She hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d  \n     \u2022 The repeated  for example, phrase (<quote> Others besides Currie have benefited f</quote>) signals these two cases as paradigmatic. Other entries simply \u201cfine\u2010tune\u201d scores without narrative defense.  \n   B. Disproportionate space & poll data  \n     \u2022 The 2 paragraphs on Currie & Lewinsky (~170 words) vs. a single bullet rating for each of 29 players.  \n     \u2022 <quote>I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent</quote> contrasted with Currie (+8) and dozens of others. The author sees this as an anomaly requiring \u201crecalibration.\u201d  \n\n2. Slate\u2019s selective sympathy & critique pattern betray advocacy for recalibrating Lewinsky\u2019s treatment, not neutral cataloging.  \n   A. No narrative empathy for other low\u2010rated figures  \n     \u2022 Linda Tripp (-7), Dick Morris (-7) get no mitigating narrative. If recalibration were panoramic, why omit narrative for other \u201cdragooned\u201d figures (e.g., Cabinet, Chelsea)?  \n   B. Only Lewinsky & Currie receive \u201cdragooned unwillingly\u201d defense  \n     \u2022 Secret Service get brief plus, but no \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d narrative. <quote>Dragged unwillingly into scandal</quote> appears in scorecard only.  \n     \u2022 The scorecard language for Lewinsky: lists six \u201cminuses\u201d then four \u201cpluses\u201d showing ambivalence but narrative voice insists \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s objections fail:  \n   A. \u201cInvitation: You decide\u201d (<quote> You decide.)</quote>) acknowledges reader role but follows narrative framing. Readers invited to apply paradigm illustrated by first two examples (Currie, Lewinsky). That is standard \u201cinductive\u201d presentation.  \n   B. Title \u201cBlame Game\u201d & \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d apply to public\u2019s distorted judgments \u2013 the author\u2019s examples are Currie and Lewinsky, not Bill Clinton\u2019s perjury or Stephanopoulos\u2019s hypocrisy. Slate never says \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d again after para.2, so initial call pertains to paradigmatic cases only.  \n   C. Scorecard\u2019s \u201cplus\u201d for Chelsea Clinton (+10) involves no moral choice or cover\u2010up; she merely suffers public scrutiny. But Chelsea is never interpreted narrative\u2010wise. No call to \u201crecalibrate\u201d Chelsea\u2019s rating. Only real-world \u201cdragooned\u201d adults (Currie, Lewinsky) are defended.  \n\n4. Logical consistency: An article truly surveying \u201call\u201d participants neutrally would:  \n   A. Provide narrative for a representative sample across the spectrum (e.g., Clinton himself, Starr, Cabinet, Paula Jones). It does not.  \n   B. Explain score methodology (it doesn\u2019t beyond \u201cnot exact science\u201d). Instead, it illustrates it by two sympathetic cases to set tone.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s structure\u2014inaugurating with Currie, then Lewinsky as the  for example, cases\u2014plus the extraordinary emphasis on Lewinsky\u2019s low public rating vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis mitigating factors, and absence of similar narratives for other players, demonstrates that the article seeks to correct the unique injustice of Lewinsky\u2019s treatment. My summary, not Debater_A\u2019s, captures this central thrust.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Slate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Slate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
