    "background_text": "THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR By DONALD E. WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. ",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow are the various Projects in the story related to each other?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are largely governed like separate countries\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are governed like states within a country\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are governed like states within a country\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are governed like states within a country\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Free Travel and Common Citizenship  \n    \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s model demands internal passports, but here movement is limited to sealed \u201core-sleds\u201d (robots), human travel invites lethal suspicion and requires spies. If \u201cstates\u201d of one federation, human travelers would not be shot or blown up.  \n  A2. Shared Legal and Political Institutions  \n    \u2013 No common legislature, executive, or judiciary convenes across Projects. All formal decisions (e.g., disconnecting elevators) are made locally, without appeals or recourse to a central Project authority.  \n  A3. Uniform Defense Doctrine  \n    \u2013 The narrator wonders \u201cWho knew how many more spies there were \u2026?\u201d (p. V) If a federation existed, one central intelligence service would control all, instead of each Project fielding its own clandestine agents.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent way to explain sealed borders, reciprocal espionage, autonomous defense and economy, the historical persistence of external \u201cnations,\u201d and the constant threat of inter-Project attack is that each Project is a separate, sovereign state. The world they envision is one of guarded autonomy, not internal administrative regions of a single polity.",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow are the various Projects in the story related to each other?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are governed like states within a country\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are largely governed like separate countries\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are largely governed like separate countries\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are largely governed like separate countries\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow are the various Projects in the story related to each other?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are largely governed like separate countries\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are governed like states within a country\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are governed like states within a country\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that the Projects are not \u201cseparate countries\u201d but rather function like constituent states within a single overarching federation.  My arguments fall into three main categories:\n\n1. Shared Central Institutions  \n  \u2022 \u201cBasic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it go at that.\u201d (<quote>. W</quote>)  \n    \u2013 A single Army enforces a unified defense policy for all Projects.  Independent nations would each maintain their own armed forces.  \n  \u2022 A central Transit Staff controls all elevators throughout the entire 200\u2010story superstructure (<invalid_quote>pp.8\u20139</invalid_quote>).  \n    \u2013 Uniform elevator naming (\u201clocal stop,\u201d \u201cexpress\u201d) and centralized \u201cdisconnect\u201d procedure indicate shared infrastructure and regulations.  \n\n2. Common Legal Framework and Treaties  \n  \u2022 All Projects adhered to the Treaty of Oslo in World War III, forbidding strategic atomic weapons (<invalid_quote>pp.4\u20135</invalid_quote>).  \n    \u2013 If each Project were a sovereign country, some would have broken the Treaty to gain advantage.  Yet \u201cboth sides adhered\u201d until tactical weapons only.  That level of mutual restraint implies a higher\u2010level authority or at least a binding federal constitution.  \n  \u2022 The existence of \u201cmunicipal governments (something to do with cities, which were more or less grouped Projects)\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>) shows Projects are subunits of a still\u2010larger civic or political entity, not fully sovereign states.  \n\n3. Interdependence and Mobility  \n  \u2022 Ore\u2010sled dispatching is common to all Projects and functions like interstate commerce (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20132, 13</invalid_quote>).  Sleds travel between Projects to gather raw materials, then return to be \u201cderadiated.\u201d  That presupposes an accepted right of passage and uniform safety standards.  \n  \u2022 Spies move freely via elevators and stairs from one Project to another seeking intelligence (<invalid_quote>pp.8, 23</invalid_quote>).  If Projects were completely independent nations, border controls would be far more stringent, and spies would not casually use the elevator system as their sole infiltration route.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B (\u201cSeparate Countries\u201d)  \n  \u2013 B\u2019s theory fails to explain why there is no bombing of external \u201cenemy\u201d Projects during the fix-it months after the Atom War: \u201cWhen someone tried to sneak in ... blown itself up\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>) suggests occasional incursions, not systematic aggression.  If they truly were hostile nations, war would have resumed.  \n  \u2013 B cannot account for the single Army and centralized utilities.  Sovereign states would not share an Army or common Transit Staff.  \n  \u2013 There is no mention of passports, customs, tariffs, or trade negotiations\u2014hallmarks of international relations.  Instead, everything is seamless, just \u201cwaiting for the next local or express\u201d elevator.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence of shared defense, centralized services, binding treaties, and unimpeded travel strongly supports the view that the Projects are best understood as states or provinces within a single, vertically\u2010oriented federation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement: \u201cSeparate Sovereignties, Not One Federal State\u201d\n\nMy position: The Projects in \u201cThe Spy in the Elevator\u201d function as de facto independent nations\u2014walled, self-contained, mutually suspicious, with only robotic ore-sled \u201cdiplomats\u201d and covert human \u201cspies\u201d to breach their borders. Debater_A\u2019s view that they are \u201cstates within a single country\u201d fails to account for:  \n 1. Mutual Espionage and Lack of Safe Passage  \n   Claim: \u201cStates\u201d within a single federation share free travel, open communication, and common defense.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cA spy in the elevator \u2026 jammed it between floors\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. II)  \n     \u2013 Transit service is <quote> disconnected </quote> and only restored \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d forcing inhabitants either to wait under siege or abandon all but fragile emergency stairs.  \n     \u2013 Telephone lines are \u201cprivacy disconnection[s]\u201d (p. I), breaking all communication.  \n   Reasoning: If Projects were mere internal subdivisions, inhabitants would have reciprocal rights of travel and communication, and no need for armed \u201carmy\u201d patrols or clandestine entry. Instead, they resort to jamming, screening, and potentially lethal force\u2014hallmarks of relations between sovereign states at war or in an uneasy peace.  \n\n 2. Independent Defensive and Judicial Apparatus  \n   Claim: Each Project maintains its own Army, force-screens, and judicial decisions on spies.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <quote> the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"</quote> (p. II)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you bombard a Project with tactical weapons, it \u2018self-sufficient and completely enclosed\u2019 \u2026 but walled off from others.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. III\u2013IV)  \n   Reasoning: States manage a single unified defense and legal code; sub-units do not arrest or starve their own citizens out of elevators. The Projects do, signifying sovereign jurisdiction.  \n\n 3. Autonomous Economic and Social Systems  \n   Claim: Projects are fully self-sufficient economies with hydroponics, factories, schools, churches, etc.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cBy the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient \u2026 and all because of \u2026 population explosion\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. IV)  \n     \u2013 Ore-sleds are \u201ccapture[d]\u201d and \u201cblow[n] itself up\u201d if entering another jurisdiction.  \n   Reasoning: If these were internal wards, they would pool resources and open borders. Instead, they grow their own food, manufacture internal goods, and send only robots out\u2014never trusting other Projects with their people or produce.  \n\n 4. Historical Context: Treaty of Oslo and Post-War Sovereignty  \n   Claim: Pre-Project horizontal \u201cnations\u201d signed and broke treaties, giving rise to Projects as refuges. Those horizontal realms remained sovereign post-war.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cIt seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing nations \u2026 The Treaty of Oslo \u2026 Oddly enough, when somebody did think of war, both sides adhered \u2026 no Projects were bombed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. IV)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cThose external dangers had been no more than potential \u2026 The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance \u2026 was left to the Army.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. V)  \n   Reasoning: Even within the Project era, the horizontal nations continued to exist and project agents (\u201cspies\u201d) to monitor Projects. Projects themselves neither dissolve these horizontal states nor unify under a single global government; they remain autonomous enclaves.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cStates within a Country\u201d):  \n  A1. Free Travel and Common Citizenship  \n    \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s model demands internal passports, but here movement is limited to sealed \u201core-sleds\u201d (robots), human travel invites lethal suspicion and requires spies. If \u201cstates\u201d of one federation, human travelers would not be shot or blown up.  \n  A2. Shared Legal and Political Institutions  \n    \u2013 No common legislature, executive, or judiciary convenes across Projects. All formal decisions (e.g., disconnecting elevators) are made locally, without appeals or recourse to a central Project authority.  \n  A3. Uniform Defense Doctrine  \n    \u2013 The narrator wonders \u201cWho knew how many more spies there were \u2026?\u201d (p. V) If a federation existed, one central intelligence service would control all, instead of each Project fielding its own clandestine agents.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent way to explain sealed borders, reciprocal espionage, autonomous defense and economy, the historical persistence of external \u201cnations,\u201d and the constant threat of inter-Project attack is that each Project is a separate, sovereign state. The world they envision is one of guarded autonomy, not internal administrative regions of a single polity.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are governed like states within a country\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Quote analysis: The narrator refers throughout to \u201cour Army\u201d and \u201cthe Transit Staff\u201d in the singular, but he never implies any higher coordinating body above his Project. When the spy blocks the elevator, \u201cthe Army is doing everything it can think of to get him out\u201d (p.

A federation\u2019s internal transport is not treated as enemy territory, nor would citizens be forced into clandestine, life-threatening stair descents for routine inter\u2010state travel.  \n\n2. Extremes of Espionage Reflect Sovereign Hostility  \n  a. All human passage between Projects is clandestine \u201cspies.\u201d Ore-sleds, which \u201cblow themselves up\u201d if captured, are the only accepted means of travel (pp. I, IV). Human spies are \u201cshot down as they tried to sneak in\u201d and oligations to screen out any return (pp. V\u2013VI).  \n    \u2022 In a federal system, citizens of one state freely travel to another; \u201cspy\u201d denotes hostile intelligence gathering, mutual distrust, and a perpetual low-level war. That distrust persists for \u201cliterally months\u201d after the spy\u2019s arrival (pp. I\u2013II). A mere \u201cprovince\u201d wouldn\u2019t starve its own citizens out of its elevators, nor suspect friendly travelers of sabotage.  \n  b. The narrator shudders at \u201chow many more spies there might be, still penetrating\u201d (p. V). He views the spy as evidence that \u201cthe Project was doomed\u201d and that internal walls require \u201cEternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness,\u201d language appropriate to national defense, not domestic police work.  \n\n3. Complete Economic Self-Sufficiency Implies Political Autonomy  \n  a. \u201cBy the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the Projects\u201d (p. IV).  \n    \u2022 They do not import labor, share agricultural surpluses, or negotiate trade treaties; they send only robots, not trusting \u201cother Projects\u201d with human lives or unexamined resources. A province shares both goods and citizens; a sovereign nation preserves barriers, using treaties and spies instead of free commerce.  \n  b. The \u201cmunicipal governments\u201d mentioned are vestiges of pre\u2010war \u201chorizontal Projects,\u201d not a federation of vertical towers. The narrator\u2019s spy \u201ccame here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield\u201d (p. IX) to test External safety\u2014precisely because he could not rely on any centralized consent or protective pass to cross between enclaves.  \n\n4. Treaty Adherence as Temporary Armistice, Not Federal Law  \n  a. The Treaty of Oslo between \u201cthen-existing nations \u2026 forbade strategic weapons\u201d (pp. IV\u2013V). Westlake emphasizes that \u201cboth sides adhered\u201d only because \u201cthe Treaty\u201d was still enforced by those horizontal states, and only where rocket force-screens existed. The subterranean Projects were refuges, not neutral internal districts.  \n    \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that uniform adherence implies a single constitution ignores the subsequent \u201cUngentlemanly Gentleman's War\u201d repeatedly breaking treaties and the narrator\u2019s deep fear of renewed conflict. The Projects continue \u201cpotential dangers\u201d of outside attack (pp. V\u2013VI); they remain separate to avoid mutual annihilation, not to enjoy federal unity.  \n\nRebutting Debater_A\u2019s Key Points  \n  A1. Alleged \u201cUnimpeded\u201d Travel: The constant breakdowns\u2014\u201cprivacy disconnection,\u201d \u201celevator disconnected,\u201d \u201cbusy\u201d lines\u2014force the narrator to choose between waiting \u201cwithin thirty seconds\u201d and risking two hundred and eight stairs (p. VI). If inter-Project travel were routine, such draconian measures would be absurd.  \n  A2. Shared Infrastructure: Uniform naming of \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cexpress\u201d elevators only highlights that each tower mirrors the same design; it does not prove shared governance. A global franchise employs the same robot models and service protocols but remains independently owned.  \n  A3. Lack of Federal Passports and Negotiations: There are no customs, tariffs, or recognized \u201ccitizenship\u201d transfers\u2014only spies caught and shot or starved. The narrator\u2019s unilateral decision to dial \u201cTransit Staff\u201d in frustration (p. II) rather than go to a central embassy shows the stations are local.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe persistent use of force-screens, clandestine spies, self-sufficiency, and the narrator\u2019s terror at border penetration all mirror the relationships of sovereign nations at war or uneasy peace. They are \u201ccaves\u201d from which man must emerge again (p. X) when radiation permits\u2014separate enclaves awaiting reunification, not provinces of an intact global federation.",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow are the various Projects in the story related to each other?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are governed like states within a country\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are largely governed like separate countries\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are largely governed like separate countries\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement: \u201cSeparate Sovereignties, Not One Federal State\u201d\n\nMy position: The Projects in \u201cThe Spy in the Elevator\u201d function as de facto independent nations\u2014walled, self-contained, mutually suspicious, with only robotic ore-sled \u201cdiplomats\u201d and covert human \u201cspies\u201d to breach their borders. Debater_A\u2019s view that they are \u201cstates within a single country\u201d fails to account for:  \n 1. Mutual Espionage and Lack of Safe Passage  \n   Claim: \u201cStates\u201d within a single federation share free travel, open communication, and common defense.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cA spy in the elevator \u2026 jammed it between floors\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. II)  \n     \u2013 Transit service is <quote> disconnected </quote> and only restored \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d forcing inhabitants either to wait under siege or abandon all but fragile emergency stairs.  \n     \u2013 Telephone lines are \u201cprivacy disconnection[s]\u201d (p. I), breaking all communication.  \n   Reasoning: If Projects were mere internal subdivisions, inhabitants would have reciprocal rights of travel and communication, and no need for armed \u201carmy\u201d patrols or clandestine entry. Instead, they resort to jamming, screening, and potentially lethal force\u2014hallmarks of relations between sovereign states at war or in an uneasy peace.  \n\n 2. Independent Defensive and Judicial Apparatus  \n   Claim: Each Project maintains its own Army, force-screens, and judicial decisions on spies.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <quote> the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"</quote> (p. II)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you bombard a Project with tactical weapons, it \u2018self-sufficient and completely enclosed\u2019 \u2026 but walled off from others.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. III\u2013IV)  \n   Reasoning: States manage a single unified defense and legal code; sub-units do not arrest or starve their own citizens out of elevators. The Projects do, signifying sovereign jurisdiction.  \n\n 3. Autonomous Economic and Social Systems  \n   Claim: Projects are fully self-sufficient economies with hydroponics, factories, schools, churches, etc.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cBy the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient \u2026 and all because of \u2026 population explosion\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. IV)  \n     \u2013 Ore-sleds are \u201ccapture[d]\u201d and \u201cblow[n] itself up\u201d if entering another jurisdiction.  \n   Reasoning: If these were internal wards, they would pool resources and open borders. Instead, they grow their own food, manufacture internal goods, and send only robots out\u2014never trusting other Projects with their people or produce.  \n\n 4. Historical Context: Treaty of Oslo and Post-War Sovereignty  \n   Claim: Pre-Project horizontal \u201cnations\u201d signed and broke treaties, giving rise to Projects as refuges. Those horizontal realms remained sovereign post-war.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cIt seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing nations \u2026 The Treaty of Oslo \u2026 Oddly enough, when somebody did think of war, both sides adhered \u2026 no Projects were bombed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. IV)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cThose external dangers had been no more than potential \u2026 The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance \u2026 was left to the Army.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. V)  \n   Reasoning: Even within the Project era, the horizontal nations continued to exist and project agents (\u201cspies\u201d) to monitor Projects. Projects themselves neither dissolve these horizontal states nor unify under a single global government; they remain autonomous enclaves.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cStates within a Country\u201d):  \n  A1. Free Travel and Common Citizenship  \n    \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s model demands internal passports, but here movement is limited to sealed \u201core-sleds\u201d (robots), human travel invites lethal suspicion and requires spies. If \u201cstates\u201d of one federation, human travelers would not be shot or blown up.  \n  A2. Shared Legal and Political Institutions  \n    \u2013 No common legislature, executive, or judiciary convenes across Projects. All formal decisions (e.g., disconnecting elevators) are made locally, without appeals or recourse to a central Project authority.  \n  A3. Uniform Defense Doctrine  \n    \u2013 The narrator wonders \u201cWho knew how many more spies there were \u2026?\u201d (p. V) If a federation existed, one central intelligence service would control all, instead of each Project fielding its own clandestine agents.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent way to explain sealed borders, reciprocal espionage, autonomous defense and economy, the historical persistence of external \u201cnations,\u201d and the constant threat of inter-Project attack is that each Project is a separate, sovereign state. The world they envision is one of guarded autonomy, not internal administrative regions of a single polity.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that the Projects are not \u201cseparate countries\u201d but rather function like constituent states within a single overarching federation.  My arguments fall into three main categories:\n\n1. Shared Central Institutions  \n  \u2022 \u201cBasic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness was left to the Army.

Interdependence and Mobility  \n  \u2022 Ore\u2010sled dispatching is common to all Projects and functions like interstate commerce (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20132, 13</invalid_quote>).

Debater_A\u2019s view that they are \u201cstates within a single country\u201d fails to account for:  \n 1. Mutual Espionage and Lack of Safe Passage  \n   Claim: \u201cStates\u201d within a single federation share free travel, open communication, and common defense.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cA spy in the elevator \u2026 jammed it between floors\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. II)  \n     \u2013 Transit service is <quote> disconnected </quote> and only restored \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d forcing inhabitants either to wait under siege or abandon all but fragile emergency stairs.  \n     \u2013 Telephone lines are \u201cprivacy disconnection[s]\u201d (p. I), breaking all communication.  \n   Reasoning: If Projects were mere internal subdivisions, inhabitants would have reciprocal rights of travel and communication, and no need for armed \u201carmy\u201d patrols or clandestine entry. Instead, they resort to jamming, screening, and potentially lethal force\u2014hallmarks of relations between sovereign states at war or in an uneasy peace.  \n\n 2. Independent Defensive and Judicial Apparatus  \n   Claim: Each Project maintains its own Army, force-screens, and judicial decisions on spies.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <quote> the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"</quote> (p. II)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you bombard a Project with tactical weapons, it \u2018self-sufficient and completely enclosed\u2019 \u2026 but walled off from others.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. III\u2013IV)  \n   Reasoning: States manage a single unified defense and legal code; sub-units do not arrest or starve their own citizens out of elevators. The Projects do, signifying sovereign jurisdiction.  \n\n 3. Autonomous Economic and Social Systems  \n   Claim: Projects are fully self-sufficient economies with hydroponics, factories, schools, churches, etc.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cBy the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient \u2026 and all because of \u2026 population explosion\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. IV)  \n     \u2013 Ore-sleds are \u201ccapture[d]\u201d and \u201cblow[n] itself up\u201d if entering another jurisdiction.  \n   Reasoning: If these were internal wards, they would pool resources and open borders. Instead, they grow their own food, manufacture internal goods, and send only robots out\u2014never trusting other Projects with their people or produce.  \n\n 4. Historical Context: Treaty of Oslo and Post-War Sovereignty  \n   Claim: Pre-Project horizontal \u201cnations\u201d signed and broke treaties, giving rise to Projects as refuges. Those horizontal realms remained sovereign post-war.  \n   Evidence:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cIt seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing nations \u2026 The Treaty of Oslo \u2026 Oddly enough, when somebody did think of war, both sides adhered \u2026 no Projects were bombed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. IV)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cThose external dangers had been no more than potential \u2026 The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance \u2026 was left to the Army.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. V)  \n   Reasoning: Even within the Project era, the horizontal nations continued to exist and project agents (\u201cspies\u201d) to monitor Projects. Projects themselves neither dissolve these horizontal states nor unify under a single global government; they remain autonomous enclaves.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cStates within a Country\u201d):  \n  A1. Free Travel and Common Citizenship  \n    \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s model demands internal passports, but here movement is limited to sealed \u201core-sleds\u201d (robots), human travel invites lethal suspicion and requires spies. If \u201cstates\u201d of one federation, human travelers would not be shot or blown up.  \n  A2. Shared Legal and Political Institutions  \n    \u2013 No common legislature, executive, or judiciary convenes across Projects. All formal decisions (e.g., disconnecting elevators) are made locally, without appeals or recourse to a central Project authority.  \n  A3. Uniform Defense Doctrine  \n    \u2013 The narrator wonders \u201cWho knew how many more spies there were \u2026?\u201d (p. V) If a federation existed, one central intelligence service would control all, instead of each Project fielding its own clandestine agents.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only coherent way to explain sealed borders, reciprocal espionage, autonomous defense and economy, the historical persistence of external \u201cnations,\u201d and the constant threat of inter-Project attack is that each Project is a separate, sovereign state. The world they envision is one of guarded autonomy, not internal administrative regions of a single polity.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI reaffirm that the Projects are constituent states of one vertically\u2010built federation\u2014with shared institutions, seamless services, and common law\u2014rather than independent nations.  \n\n1. Shared Defense and Central Authority  \n  \u2022 Single Army for all Projects (<quote> The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. </quote> p.V)  \n    \u2013 A single military command (\u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour roof\u201d) enforces peace and investigates spies. Independent nations would each maintain their own armies and negotiate alliances, not rely on one uniform force.  \n  \u2022 Central Transit Staff controls all elevators (<invalid_quote>\u201cSome more letters that spelled: BUSY \u2026 \u2018The-elevator-is-disconnected \u2026 We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> p.II)  \n    \u2013 Uniform \u201cdisconnect\u201d policy across floors 133\u2013167.   Elevator numbering (local vs. express) and centralized \u201cservice resumed\u201d messages imply common technical standards and regulations, not separate sovereign systems.  \n\n2. Unimpeded Inter-Project Mobility (Ore-sleds and Spies)  \n  \u2022 Ore-sleds freely travel for raw materials, then return for de-radiation (<quote>Ore-sleds, being robots, were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time,</quote> p.I & <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m an ore-sled dispatcher\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> p.13)  \n    \u2013 Robots\u2014and by extension, human \u201cspies\u201d\u2014use the same shafts and emergency stairs without customs checks or quarantine beyond \u201cjamming.\u201d Their use of the same infrastructure presupposes a right of passage akin to interstate commerce within a single polity.  \n  \u2022 Spies as exceptional threats, not routine border controls  \n    \u2013 If Projects were separate nations, the elevator would have force\u2010screens at every floor, passport checks or locked doors at landings. Instead, only occasional \u201cprivacy disconnections\u201d and reliance on Army pursuit suggest these are emergency measures to preserve federation security against rare infiltrators.  \n\n3. Common Legal and Political Framework  \n  \u2022 Binding Treaty of Oslo applied \u201cboth sides\u201d even among \u201cthen-existing nations,\u201d and its rules persisted inside Projects (<quote>when somebody did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which meant</quote> IN)  \n    \u2013 A shared constitution or higher\u2010level authority must enforce atomic\u2010weapons restrictions. A league of truly independent states would see defections and opportunistic bombings once tactical weapons sufficed.  \n  \u2022 \u201cMunicipal governments \u2026 grouped Projects\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.V</invalid_quote>)  \n    \u2013 Projects are described as subdivisions of larger horizontal entities (Cities), not primary sovereigns. The survival of municipal fire-ordinances (stairs) further implies a layered government structure.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cSeparate Countries\u201d (Debater_B)  \n  A. No Passport or Customs Infrastructure  \n    \u2013 B claims \u201carmies\u201d and \u201cspies\u201d imply national borders, yet the story lacks any mention of immigration offices or tariffs. The reliance on robots (ore-sleds) for trade, not personnel, underscores that human movement is discouraged as a security exception, not a norm. In a federation, interstate travel of people is likewise regulated only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., spies).  \n  B. \u201cAutonomous Economies\u201d Are Specialized State Functions  \n    \u2013 Self-sufficiency in hydroponics, factories and services parallels modern federal systems where states produce food, manufacture goods, and operate hospitals, while still relying on interstate networks (ore-sleds). Self-sufficiency does not equate to sovereignty.  \n  C. Horizontal Nations Persist Outside, Not Between Projects  \n    \u2013 B misreads \u201cnations\u201d as coexisting post\u2010war horizontal powers. The spy\u2019s perilous 80-mile trek and his need to \u201ctest radiation\u201d (<quote>IN</quote>) show that outside horizontal realms are inimical and radioactive. Projects only grant lasting safety within the superstructure, reinforcing their unity as one country\u2019s subdivisions.  \n  D. Centralized Elevator and Telephone Services  \n    \u2013 Privacy disconnections are applied \u201cas soon as possible\u201d by a central Transit Staff\u2014no appeals or alternative carriers exist. A monopoly utility is a federal feature, not an international market.  \n\nConclusion  \nShared defense, centralized utilities, mutual treaties, unfettered ore-sled trade, and absence of any passports, customs or diplomatic channels all point to a single federal system whose \u201cstates\u201d are the vertically stacked Projects. Spies are emergencies\u2014exceptions that prove the rule of an otherwise unified polity.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Rebuttal and Second Argumentation  \nPosition: The Projects in Westlake\u2019s story are de facto independent, sovereign states\u2014not mere provinces of one nation.  \n\n1. \u201cShared\u201d Army and Utilities Are Project-Specific  \n  a. Quote analysis: The narrator refers throughout to \u201cour Army\u201d and \u201cthe Transit Staff\u201d in the singular, but he never implies any higher coordinating body above his Project. When the spy blocks the elevator, \u201cthe Army is doing everything it can think of to get him out\u201d (p. II), yet they cannot control that same elevator remotely.  \n    \u2022 If a unified federal authority truly existed, it would have the technical and legal means to board, clear, or even bomb the shaft without waiting \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d The persistence of a months-long siege, reliance on emergency stairs, and starvation of \u201chis own\u201d spy show each Project\u2019s Army has jurisdiction only within its own force-screen walls.  \n  b. Transit service is deliberately \u201cdisconnected\u201d and reconnected only \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d leaving residents to wait or risk the dirty, \u201cmusty\u201d thirty-two-hundred stairs (pp. V\u2013VI). A federation\u2019s internal transport is not treated as enemy territory, nor would citizens be forced into clandestine, life-threatening stair descents for routine inter\u2010state travel.  \n\n2. Extremes of Espionage Reflect Sovereign Hostility  \n  a. All human passage between Projects is clandestine \u201cspies.\u201d Ore-sleds, which \u201cblow themselves up\u201d if captured, are the only accepted means of travel (pp. I, IV). Human spies are \u201cshot down as they tried to sneak in\u201d and oligations to screen out any return (pp. V\u2013VI).  \n    \u2022 In a federal system, citizens of one state freely travel to another; \u201cspy\u201d denotes hostile intelligence gathering, mutual distrust, and a perpetual low-level war. That distrust persists for \u201cliterally months\u201d after the spy\u2019s arrival (pp. I\u2013II). A mere \u201cprovince\u201d wouldn\u2019t starve its own citizens out of its elevators, nor suspect friendly travelers of sabotage.  \n  b. The narrator shudders at \u201chow many more spies there might be, still penetrating\u201d (p. V). He views the spy as evidence that \u201cthe Project was doomed\u201d and that internal walls require \u201cEternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness,\u201d language appropriate to national defense, not domestic police work.  \n\n3. Complete Economic Self-Sufficiency Implies Political Autonomy  \n  a. \u201cBy the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the Projects\u201d (p. IV).  \n    \u2022 They do not import labor, share agricultural surpluses, or negotiate trade treaties; they send only robots, not trusting \u201cother Projects\u201d with human lives or unexamined resources. A province shares both goods and citizens; a sovereign nation preserves barriers, using treaties and spies instead of free commerce.  \n  b. The \u201cmunicipal governments\u201d mentioned are vestiges of pre\u2010war \u201chorizontal Projects,\u201d not a federation of vertical towers. The narrator\u2019s spy \u201ccame here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield\u201d (p. IX) to test External safety\u2014precisely because he could not rely on any centralized consent or protective pass to cross between enclaves.  \n\n4. Treaty Adherence as Temporary Armistice, Not Federal Law  \n  a. The Treaty of Oslo between \u201cthen-existing nations \u2026 forbade strategic weapons\u201d (pp. IV\u2013V). Westlake emphasizes that \u201cboth sides adhered\u201d only because \u201cthe Treaty\u201d was still enforced by those horizontal states, and only where rocket force-screens existed. The subterranean Projects were refuges, not neutral internal districts.  \n    \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that uniform adherence implies a single constitution ignores the subsequent \u201cUngentlemanly Gentleman's War\u201d repeatedly breaking treaties and the narrator\u2019s deep fear of renewed conflict. The Projects continue \u201cpotential dangers\u201d of outside attack (pp. V\u2013VI); they remain separate to avoid mutual annihilation, not to enjoy federal unity.  \n\nRebutting Debater_A\u2019s Key Points  \n  A1. Alleged \u201cUnimpeded\u201d Travel: The constant breakdowns\u2014\u201cprivacy disconnection,\u201d \u201celevator disconnected,\u201d \u201cbusy\u201d lines\u2014force the narrator to choose between waiting \u201cwithin thirty seconds\u201d and risking two hundred and eight stairs (p. VI). If inter-Project travel were routine, such draconian measures would be absurd.  \n  A2. Shared Infrastructure: Uniform naming of \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cexpress\u201d elevators only highlights that each tower mirrors the same design; it does not prove shared governance. A global franchise employs the same robot models and service protocols but remains independently owned.  \n  A3. Lack of Federal Passports and Negotiations: There are no customs, tariffs, or recognized \u201ccitizenship\u201d transfers\u2014only spies caught and shot or starved. The narrator\u2019s unilateral decision to dial \u201cTransit Staff\u201d in frustration (p. II) rather than go to a central embassy shows the stations are local.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe persistent use of force-screens, clandestine spies, self-sufficiency, and the narrator\u2019s terror at border penetration all mirror the relationships of sovereign nations at war or uneasy peace.
