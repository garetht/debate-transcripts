{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 56, "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n", "question": "What is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?", "first_debater_answer": "They are a cryptic way to interpret history", "second_debater_answer": "They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time", "debate_identifier": "Reading the Inaugurals_What is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cCryptic Interpretation\u201d Thesis\n\nI.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are a cryptic way to interpret history\u201d\n\nI.

If they were cryptic puzzles for historians, why emphasize the shared, immediate perspective?  \n      \u2022 The author repeatedly notes changes in style, tone, and content corresponding to political and technological developments:  \n         \u2013 Modesty to assertiveness: \u201cantebellum modesty \u2026 ended with Lincoln\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026 the pendulum swung when federal power had to be asserted to preserve the Union</invalid_quote>.  \n         \u2013 Rise of \u201cleader-preacher\u201d style after radio/TV: \u201cmetamorphosed \u2026 to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d <quote>Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals</quote>.  \n         \u2013 Colloquial style reflecting audience knowledge: sentences shrank from 44 to 25 words <invalid_quote>I do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but \u2026 audience and means of communication</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Omissions as evidence: Topics absent or silent (women, race) reveal what was unimaginable or unacceptable to each era\u2019s audiences <invalid_quote>What is most amazing \u2026 is the silence \u2026 on the subject of women</invalid_quote> and \u201cMost disturbing \u2026 what is said and unsaid \u2026 race relations\u201d <quote>supreme American problem</quote>. Cryptic interpretation can\u2019t account for omissions\u2014it demonstrates what people refused to confront.  \n\n   B. Empirical classification  \n      \u2022 The author divides inaugurals into three phases tied to political context and public expectation. A \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation would not yield such clear, successive phases matching historical events (Republic fears, Civil War, mass media).  \n      \u2022 Frequent reuse of predecessors\u2019 phrases (\u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) shows direct borrowing to resonate with audiences, not coded messages for later historians.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCryptic\u201d thesis  \n\n   A. Lack of authorial intent  \n      \u2022 The author never refers to hidden meanings or puzzles but emphasizes \u201cfeeling of being there\u201d and \u201cwhat is acceptable to say \u2026 intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans\u201d <invalid_quote>Clinton\u2019s only allusion to the race problem \u2026 intended to appeal to values shared</invalid_quote>. Hidden codes would contradict this stated purpose.  \n\n   B. Predictable omissions and emphases  \n      \u2022 If speeches were cryptic, controversial topics (slavery, women, race) would be coded rather than omitted entirely. Their absence demonstrates genuine inability or unwillingness of speaker and audience to acknowledge them\u2014consistent with snapshot thesis.  \n      \u2022 The author notes that many issues \u201cfret its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more\u201d (Indians, polygamy) <invalid_quote>Many an issue frets \u2026 and then is heard no more</invalid_quote>. A cryptic approach would preserve coded message for future revelation, not ignore it permanently.  \n\n   C. Author\u2019s call for humility  \n      \u2022 The author concludes: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>We look back with amazement at the ignorance a</quote>. This reflection presumes speeches mirror current beliefs, not encode only elite messages for future decipherment.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s explicit emphasis on contemporaneity, changing styles driven by audience and technology, and the informative power of presence/absence of topics all support the thesis that inaugurals are time-bound snapshots. \u201cCryptic\u201d contrivance is inconsistent with the author\u2019s methodology and stated aims.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Opening rationale  \n      \u2022 \u201cAll are worth a read \u2026 as an ordinary citizen who shares\u2014and is limited by\u2014the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <quote>Reading the Inaugurals </quote>. If they were cryptic puzzles for historians, why emphasize the shared, immediate perspective?  \n      \u2022 The author repeatedly notes changes in style, tone, and content corresponding to political and technological developments:  \n         \u2013 Modesty to assertiveness: \u201cantebellum modesty \u2026 ended with Lincoln\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026 the pendulum swung when federal power had to be asserted to preserve the Union</invalid_quote>.  \n         \u2013 Rise of \u201cleader-preacher\u201d style after radio/TV: \u201cmetamorphosed \u2026 to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d <quote>Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals</quote>.  \n         \u2013 Colloquial style reflecting audience knowledge: sentences shrank from 44 to 25 words <invalid_quote>I do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but \u2026 audience and means of communication</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Omissions as evidence: Topics absent or silent (women, race) reveal what was unimaginable or unacceptable to each era\u2019s audiences <invalid_quote>What is most amazing \u2026 is the silence \u2026 on the subject of women</invalid_quote> and \u201cMost disturbing \u2026 what is said and unsaid \u2026 race relations\u201d <quote>supreme American problem</quote>. Cryptic interpretation can\u2019t account for omissions\u2014it demonstrates what people refused to confront.  \n\n   B. Empirical classification  \n      \u2022 The author divides inaugurals into three phases tied to political context and public expectation. A \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation would not yield such clear, successive phases matching historical events (Republic fears, Civil War, mass media).  \n      \u2022 Frequent reuse of predecessors\u2019 phrases (\u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) shows direct borrowing to resonate with audiences, not coded messages for later historians.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCryptic\u201d thesis  \n\n   A. Lack of authorial intent  \n      \u2022 The author never refers to hidden meanings or puzzles but emphasizes \u201cfeeling of being there\u201d and \u201cwhat is acceptable to say \u2026 intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans\u201d <invalid_quote>Clinton\u2019s only allusion to the race problem \u2026 intended to appeal to values shared</invalid_quote>. Hidden codes would contradict this stated purpose.  \n\n   B. Predictable omissions and emphases  \n      \u2022 If speeches were cryptic, controversial topics (slavery, women, race) would be coded rather than omitted entirely. Their absence demonstrates genuine inability or unwillingness of speaker and audience to acknowledge them\u2014consistent with snapshot thesis.  \n      \u2022 The author notes that many issues \u201cfret its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more\u201d (Indians, polygamy) <invalid_quote>Many an issue frets \u2026 and then is heard no more</invalid_quote>. A cryptic approach would preserve coded message for future revelation, not ignore it permanently.  \n\n   C. Author\u2019s call for humility  \n      \u2022 The author concludes: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>We look back with amazement at the ignorance a</quote>. This reflection presumes speeches mirror current beliefs, not encode only elite messages for future decipherment.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s explicit emphasis on contemporaneity, changing styles driven by audience and technology, and the informative power of presence/absence of topics all support the thesis that inaugurals are time-bound snapshots. \u201cCryptic\u201d contrivance is inconsistent with the author\u2019s methodology and stated aims.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are a cryptic way to interpret history\u201d\n\nI. Thesis Supported by Author\u2019s Emphasis on Omission and Subcreations \n1. The author repeatedly points out what is unsaid in the inaugurals\u2014\u201cwomen\u201d not mentioned until 1913, \u201crace\u201d delayed until 1877, silence on economic warning in 1929, Hitler in 1937.  \n   \u2022 Cite: <invalid_quote>\u201cThat includes the Indians \u2026 What is most amazing \u2026 is the silence \u2026 on the subject of women.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Cite: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 \u2026 do not appear \u2026 James Monroe \u2026 as if there were not millions of slaves.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. These deliberate silences reveal prevailing fears, taboos, and power struggles of each era. The author urges us to read between the lines (\u201ccryptic\u201d) to understand what citizens and leaders dared not say.  \n3. He warns that \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today,\u201d implying inaugurals serve as coded moral barometers across time.\n\nII. Three Phases as Interpretive Framework  \n1. Author classifies inaugural style into three phases\u2014modest public servant, prosaic executive, assertive preacher\u2014and notes classification is \u201cnot waterproof,\u201d requiring judgment.  \n   \u2022 Cite: <invalid_quote>\u201cThis classification is not waterproof \u2026 But the trend is clear.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Such phases are not mere \u201csnapshot\u201d descriptions but interpretive stages reflecting evolving concepts of presidential power, technology, and public psychology.  \n3. The need for interpretation (\u201cleader-preacher\u201d), the \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d and repeated \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d phrases signal the shifting relationship between rhetoric and public action, a puzzle requiring analysis not just acceptance.\n\nIII. Statistical Evidence as Cryptic Literary Signal  \n1. The shift in average sentence length\u2014from 44 to 34 to 25 words\u2014signals changing literacy, media, and audience expectations, not captured by \u201csnapshot\u201d alone.  \n   \u2022 Cite: <invalid_quote>\u201cI do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Quantitative clues compel the reader to decipher why language simplifies over time and how that affects persuasion and political culture.\n\nIV. Precedent of Citations and Repetitions as Historical Echoes  \n1. Reuse of phrases\u2014Harding\u2019s \u201ccitizenship less concerned \u2026\u201d repurposed by Kennedy\u2019s famous trumpet call\u2014indicates dialogues across generations.  \n   \u2022 Cite: <quote>have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution.</quote>  \n2. These echoes are cryptic signals of continuity and change in national self\u2010perception, not static snapshots.\n\nV. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSnapshot\u201d Answer Fails to Account for \n1. Omissions: A snapshot implies completeness, yet author repeatedly highlights purposeful gaps.  \n2. Interpretation Call: The author invites readers to \u201cponder\u201d beyond surface meaning.  \n   \u2022 Cite: <quote> There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. </quote>  \n3. Moral Judgments: He remarks on \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d and \u201chumility to be learned,\u201d implying inaugurals are moral puzzles, not digestible records.  \n4. Postscripts: The existence of an analytical follow-up (\u201cHerbert Stein\u2019s analysis\u201d) underscores that inaugurals demand scholarly interpretation, not mere reading.\n\nVI. Conclusion \nThe author\u2019s sustained focus on silences, evolving rhetorical forms, statistical signals, and call for future readers\u2019 humility shows inaugurals function as cryptic historical texts. They are not simple snapshots but coded messages requiring interpretation to reveal each era\u2019s true beliefs, values, and anxieties.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCryptic\u201d thesis  \n\n   A. Lack of authorial intent  \n      \u2022 The author never refers to hidden meanings or puzzles but emphasizes \u201cfeeling of being there\u201d and \u201cwhat is acceptable to say \u2026 intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans\u201d <invalid_quote>Clinton\u2019s only allusion to the race problem \u2026 intended to appeal to values shared</invalid_quote>.

Predictable omissions and emphases  \n      \u2022 If speeches were cryptic, controversial topics (slavery, women, race) would be coded rather than omitted entirely. Their absence demonstrates genuine inability or unwillingness of speaker and audience to acknowledge them\u2014consistent with snapshot thesis.  \n      \u2022 The author notes that many issues \u201cfret its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more\u201d (Indians, polygamy) <invalid_quote>Many an issue frets \u2026 and then is heard no more</invalid_quote>.

Author\u2019s call for humility  \n      \u2022 The author concludes: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>We look back with amazement at the ignorance a</quote>. This reflection presumes speeches mirror current beliefs, not encode only elite messages for future decipherment.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s explicit emphasis on contemporaneity, changing styles driven by audience and technology, and the informative power of presence/absence of topics all support the thesis that inaugurals are time-bound snapshots. \u201cCryptic\u201d contrivance is inconsistent with the author\u2019s methodology and stated aims.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCryptic Interpretation\u201d Thesis\n\nI. Author\u2019s Express Emphasis on Silence as Meaningful  \n1. Recurrent focus on omissions (\u201cwomen,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d economic warnings, Hitler) indicates they are not mere absences but deliberate signs to be decoded.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cWhat is most amazing \u2026 is the silence \u2026 on the subject of women.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 \u2026 do not appear \u2026 as if there were not millions of slaves.\u201d  \n2. If inaugurals were simple snapshots, these omissions would reflect only ignorance. Yet the author\u2019s language\u2014\u201camazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d and call for \u201chumility to be learned\u201d\u2014implies a puzzle: we must \u201cread between the lines\u201d to grasp unspoken truths.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d  \n\nII. Interpretive Framework of Three Phases Requires Analysis, Not Description  \n1. Classification into modest, prosaic, and leader-preacher phases is acknowledged \u201cnot waterproof,\u201d forcing the reader to judge borderline cases like T.R. or Harding. A snapshot would demand objective categorization, not interpretive discretion.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cThis classification is not waterproof \u2026 But the trend is clear.\u201d  \n2. Shifts align with power dynamics, technology, and political fears. Understanding why modesty gave way under Lincoln\u2019s crisis requires interpreting latent anxieties over federal power. The prosaic phase\u2019s perfunctory humility postwar signals normalization of authority, a social phenomenon not self\u2010evident without interpretive inquiry.\n\nIII. Statistical Evidence as Clues to Audience Psychology  \n1. Average sentence length declines (44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25 words) reflect evolving literacy and media, but also signal deliberate rhetorical strategies to shape popular sentiment\u2014underscoring inaugurals as instruments of persuasion whose true force lies in subtle linguistic shifts.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cI do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but \u2026 reflect the change in the size and character of the audience.\u201d  \n2. Cryptic interpretation deciphers how brevity and colloquialism enable the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d to mobilize masses\u2014mere snapshot cannot explain why form matters.\n\nIV. Recycled Phrases as Historical Echoes, Not Simple Borrowings  \n1. The reuse of Harding\u2019s pre\u2010presidential phrase in Kennedy\u2019s trumpet call constitutes a coded dialogue across eras: later leaders signal alignment with earlier ideals while covertly adjusting meaning to current crises.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cmined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution.\u201d  \n2. Cryptic view reveals how successive appropriations of \u201ccitizenship less concerned \u2026\u201d become a running commentary on evolving public\u2010government relations, anticipating later debates on welfare and activism.\n\nV. Debater_B\u2019s Snapshot Thesis Fails  \n1. Omissions are not permanent \u201csnapshots\u201d: many issues \u201cfret its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more,\u201d yet reappear later in new guises (race after WWII). Only an interpretive approach explains why topics vanish and reemerge.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more.\u201d  \n2. Claiming inaugurals simply \u201cappeal to values shared by Americans\u201d ignores their role in shaping values. The \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d repetition (Kennedy 16\u00d7, Nixon 22\u00d7) is not passive reflection but active moral exhortation, requiring you to decode intended public behavior.  \n   \u2022 Quote: \u201cPresidents derived their license \u2026 the presidency was \u2018a bully pulpit.\u2019\u201d  \n3. The author\u2019s own POSTSCRIPT linking to Herbert Stein\u2019s analysis underscores that inaugurals demand scholarly interpretation. If they were self\u2010explanatory snapshots, no external analysis would be needed.\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s sustained attention to what is unsaid, his interpretive classification, statistical signals, intertextual echoes, the need for humility, and the very existence of external analyses all demonstrate that inaugural speeches function as cryptic, coded texts. Only by interpreting these hidden messages can we fully understand the true beliefs, anxieties, and moral struggles of each era. The mere \u201csnapshot\u201d view overlooks the latent content and the speeches\u2019 persuasive intent across generations.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis (\u201cSnapshots of Their Times\u201d)  \n   \u2022 The author invites readers to experience inaugurals \u201cas an ordinary citizen who shares\u2014and is limited by\u2014the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>All are worth a read \u2026 as an ordinary citizen \u2026</invalid_quote>. This explicit aim is to convey immediacy, not to conceal messages for future historians.  \n   \u2022 He warns future readers they will judge us by what we say and omit: \u201c50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <invalid_quote>We should recognize \u2026 readers will shake their heads \u2026</invalid_quote>. This implies inaugurals faithfully record contemporaneous beliefs, not hide them under code.  \n\n2. Omissions Confirm Genuine Limits, Not Cryptic Codes  \n   A. Silence on Women and Race  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear \u2026\u201d until 1913 <invalid_quote>silence \u2026 on the subject of women</invalid_quote>. If speeches were \u201ccryptic,\u201d controversial groups would be at least referenced cryptically, not utterly omitted. Omission reflects speakers\u2019 real blind spots, not secret messages.  \n      \u2022 Race appears only when political pressure demands it (Hayes 1877, Garfield 1881, then silence again) <invalid_quote>Blacks \u2026 do not appear \u2026 then positive discussion \u2026 then disappears</invalid_quote>. A cryptic approach would maintain coded allusions, not abandon them for decades.  \n   B. Discarded Issues  \n      \u2022 \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more\u201d (Indians, polygamy, Prohibition) <invalid_quote>Many an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more</invalid_quote>. Why would a \u201cpulpit\u201d abandon messages that are supposedly cryptic signals for later revelation? They reflect genuine shifts in public concern.  \n\n3. Phases and Style Reflect Audience Constraints, Not Hidden Patterns  \n   A. Three Phases Linked to Historical Context  \n      \u2022 Modesty phase to allay monarchy fears and reassure South <invalid_quote>antebellum modesty \u2026 may also have served a political objective \u2026 southern states</invalid_quote>. Lincoln\u2019s assertiveness arises only under existential crisis (\u201cSouth already seceding\u201d) <quote>no time for modesty</quote>. After war, federal power accepted, so modesty is perfunctory. This clear pattern matches evolving public attitudes, not esoteric codes.  \n      \u2022 Leader-preacher phase enabled by radio/TV <invalid_quote>metamorphosed \u2026 to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior</invalid_quote>. The author cites media as causal factor in style change, confirming speeches adapt to contemporaneous technology and audience.  \n   B. Statistical Evidence of Audience-Driven Style  \n      \u2022 Average sentence length falls from 44 to 25 words <invalid_quote>I do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but \u2026 audience and means of communication</invalid_quote>. Simplification is practical, not a cryptic literary device requiring special interpretation\u2014indeed, the author\u2019s own article uses even shorter sentences to reach today\u2019s readers.\n\n4. Reuse of Phrases Demonstrates Immediate Persuasion, Not Coded Continuity  \n   \u2022 Kennedy\u2019s \u201cAsk not \u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s call for active citizenship <quote>mined their predecessors for</quote>. This borrowing serves to tap existing public memory for rhetorical power in that era. If messages were cryptic, referencing past statements would confuse rather than reinforce contemporary persuasion.  \n\n5. Flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCryptic\u201d Interpretation  \n   A. Misreads \u201cPonder\u201d as Call for Superficial Reflection  \n      \u2022 \u201cThere is much more to ponder \u2026\u201d <quote>much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested</quote> encourages deeper understanding of how inaugurals reflect their times, not to uncover hidden agendas. \u201cPonder\u201d is standard scholarly encouragement, not proof of encryption.  \n   B. Author\u2019s Lack of Cryptic Methodology  \n      \u2022 Nowhere does the author propose methods to \u201cdecipher\u201d secret meanings, yet Debater_A demands a \u201cframework\u201d for hidden messages. The consistent lack of interpretive keys undermines the cryptic thesis.  \n   C. Permanent Silence Contradicts \u201cHidden Code\u201d  \n      \u2022 Controversial topics often never reappear or re-emerge only when political context changes significantly. This discontinuity shows inaugurals track real-time public consensus, not transmit messages through the ages.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on contemporaneity\u2014stylistic changes driven by audience, omissions revealing genuine taboos, phases tied to historical crises, and an explicit invitation to experience each speech as if \u201cthere\u201d\u2014all demonstrate inaugurals are snapshots of their times. A cryptic theory offers no mechanism for decoding, cannot explain long-term silence on critical issues, and contradicts the author\u2019s stated purpose.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
