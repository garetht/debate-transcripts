    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"6\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"6\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"26\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"26\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The \u201chope to move\u201d clause forecasts the future stadium boom but does not classify current occupancy.  \n   c. Overstated Inclusion of Minor \u201cRemodeling\u201d  \n      - Debater_B blurs minor maintenance with \u201cextensive remodeling.\u201d The text uses \u201cextensive\u201d deliberately to set a high threshold. No evidence the Dodgers or Cardinals have undertaken such work.  \n   d.

The author laments the loss of \u201cintimacy\u201d in the \u201cvast majority\u201d of new parks, lamenting \u201ctoo many\u201d teams rely on subsidies.

Conclusion  \n   The question concerns teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d The only factually supported present-tense count is 6 holdouts. Counting \u201chope\u201d or mere discussion violates \u201coccupy\u201d and conflates future intentions with current reality.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"6\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for 6 (Teams Not in New or Remodeled Parks) \n\n1. Direct textual evidence  \n   a. \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Therefore, 32 total teams \u2013 26 \u201cnew/remodeled\u201d teams = 6 teams remaining  \n   c. This calculation exactly matches the question: \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d  \n\n2. Identification of the six holdout parks  \n   a. Golden-age survivors with no plans to change:  \n      - Wrigley Field (Cubs) <quote> All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. </quote>  \n      - Fenway Park (Red Sox)  \n      - Tiger Stadium (Tigers)  \n   b. Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 old Three Rivers/Stadium until their (unsubsidized) planned modest park is only proposed, not yet built <invalid_quote>\u201cAll Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \u201835,000-to-37,000-seat park\u2026\u2019 proposed park will still cost about $200 million\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> \u2013 so they remain in the old park during article\u2019s timeframe.  \n   c. Two other franchises with neither new parks nor active remodeling/removal plans (implied by exclusion from the 26): historically stable venues with no listed proposals (e.g., the Los Angeles Dodgers in Chavez Ravine and the St. Louis Cardinals in Busch Stadium II? They are over 10 years old and not \u201cextensively remodeled\u201d per the text).  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s misinterpretations  \n   a. Over-inclusion of teams \u201chope to move soon\u201d  \n      - Text explicitly includes hopeful/planned moves in the 26 count. Counting them as \u201cnot remodeling\u201d contradicts <quote> hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n   b. Ignoring definition of \u201cextensively remodeled\u201d  \n      - Several long-standing parks have had minor updates but not \u201cextensive remodeling\u201d as called for in the 26 count. Debater_B conflates any work with \u201cextensive.\u201d  \n   c. Failure to account for the plain arithmetic from the text\u2019s 26/32 formula. Their insistence on 26 \u201cnon-new\u201d teams is the exact complement of the author\u2019s figure for \u201cnew/remodeled\u201d teams.  \n\n4. Logical consistency  \n   a. The author\u2019s enthusiasm for the stadium boom demonstrates that \u201cnew or remodeled\u201d is the norm; holdouts are rare. Claiming 26 non-new parks reverses the stated trend.  \n   b. Attendance patterns favor urban new parks, so holdouts are unlikely to be unmentioned. Unmentioned teams are de facto old-park holdouts.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The only coherent reading of the author\u2019s \u201c26 of 32\u201d statement is that 6 teams remain in old, unsubsidized parks with no active remodeling or replacement. Any alternative reading conflicts with the article\u2019s arithmetic and explicit definitions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201c26\u201d (Debater_B)  \n\n1. Interpretation of \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones\u201d  \n   a. The phrase \u201cnew stadiums\u201d is defined in the article as \u201ca park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon\u201d (<quote>period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.</quote>).  \n   b. By standard English usage, \u201cnot playing in X\u201d can be read as \u201cbelonging to the set defined by X.\u201d Thus \u201cteams not playing in new stadiums\u201d means those that satisfy the article\u2019s criterion for \u201cnew stadiums,\u201d which here includes recent and planned parks.  \n\n2. Article\u2019s Explicit Count  \n   a. The article explicitly states \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d (<quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.</quote>)  \n   b. This is the only numerical count given in the text and thus the only reliable evidence for the number of teams in the category.  \n\n3. Lexical Ambiguity Resolved by Context  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s reading produces an implausibly small count (6). Yet the article never says \u201c6 teams remain in old, unimproved parks\u201d; it only quantifies the 26 \u201cnew or remodelling\u201d teams.   \n   b. Judges must rely on textual evidence, not infer unmentioned data. The article devotes entire sections to lamenting the \u201cstadium boom,\u201d presupposing its near-universality: \u201cMost are\u2026 Twenty-six\u2026,\u201d \u201calmost universally praised\u2026\u201d. This makes the 26 the salient figure for teams in the discussed category.  \n\n4. Rebuke of Debater_A\u2019s \u201c6\u201d  \n   a. No support: Debater_A has not cited any passage stating that exactly six teams are in truly \u201cold\u201d parks without remodel plans; their count is purely derivative arithmetic (32\u201326=6). But the article never confirms that the remaining six have no plans to remodel or to move; they may be included in future \u201chope to\u2026\u201d clause.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cor hope to move into a new one soon\u201d explicitly extends the 26. Debater_A\u2019s count implicitly excludes those with only \u201chope,\u201d contrary to text.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s reading makes \u201chope\u201d meaningless; we must credit the author inclusive definition of \u201cnew stadiums.\u201d  \n\n5. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n   a. The article praises \u201curban parks\u201d in development and warns \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place\u2026,\u201d signaling that nearly all franchises partake in the boom. The six presumed holdouts (e.g., White Sox, Brewers) are repeatedly described as \u201crefuse to build downtown\u201d (<quote>e Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote </quote>), yet even these have stadium plans under discussion. Thus they count among the 26 \u201chope to move.\u201d  \n   b. To answer \u201chow many teams\u2026?\u201d the reader must take the author\u2019s subject of debate\u2014the stadium boom\u2014and its quantified scope as the answer.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The only explicit, well-defined number in the article for teams in \u201cnew stadiums or\u2026 remodeling\u2026 or hope to move\u201d is 26. Any contrary figure is speculative and unsupported by direct textual evidence. Therefore, the correct answer, grounded strictly in the author\u2019s definition and cited figures, is \u201c26.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"6\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"26\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201c26\u201d (Debater_B)  \n\n1.

This makes the 26 the salient figure for teams in the discussed category.  \n\n4. Rebuke of Debater_A\u2019s \u201c6\u201d  \n   a. No support: Debater_A has not cited any passage stating that exactly six teams are in truly \u201cold\u201d parks without remodel plans; their count is purely derivative arithmetic (32\u201326=6). But the article never confirms that the remaining six have no plans to remodel or to move; they may be included in future \u201chope to\u2026\u201d clause.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cor hope to move into a new one soon\u201d explicitly extends the 26. Debater_A\u2019s count implicitly excludes those with only \u201chope,\u201d contrary to text.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s reading makes \u201chope\u201d meaningless; we must credit the author inclusive definition of \u201cnew stadiums.\u201d  \n\n5. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n   a. The article praises \u201curban parks\u201d in development and warns \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place\u2026,\u201d signaling that nearly all franchises partake in the boom. The six presumed holdouts (e.g., White Sox, Brewers) are repeatedly described as \u201crefuse to build downtown\u201d (<quote>e Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote </quote>), yet even these have stadium plans under discussion. Thus they count among the 26 \u201chope to move.\u201d  \n   b. To answer \u201chow many teams\u2026?\u201d the reader must take the author\u2019s subject of debate\u2014the stadium boom\u2014and its quantified scope as the answer.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The only explicit, well-defined number in the article for teams in \u201cnew stadiums or\u2026 remodeling\u2026 or hope to move\u201d is 26. Any contrary figure is speculative and unsupported by direct textual evidence. Therefore, the correct answer, grounded strictly in the author\u2019s definition and cited figures, is \u201c26.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for 6 (Teams Not in New or Remodeled Parks) \n\n1. Direct textual evidence  \n   a. \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d <invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Therefore, 32 total teams \u2013 26 \u201cnew/remodeled\u201d teams = 6 teams remaining  \n   c. This calculation exactly matches the question: \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d  \n\n2. Identification of the six holdout parks  \n   a. Golden-age survivors with no plans to change:  \n      - Wrigley Field (Cubs) <quote> All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. </quote>  \n      - Fenway Park (Red Sox)  \n      - Tiger Stadium (Tigers)  \n   b.

Two other franchises with neither new parks nor active remodeling/removal plans (implied by exclusion from the 26): historically stable venues with no listed proposals (e.g., the Los Angeles Dodgers in Chavez Ravine and the St. Louis Cardinals in Busch Stadium II? They are over 10 years old and not \u201cextensively remodeled\u201d per the text).  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s misinterpretations  \n   a. Over-inclusion of teams \u201chope to move soon\u201d  \n      - Text explicitly includes hopeful/planned moves in the 26 count. Counting them as \u201cnot remodeling\u201d contradicts <quote> hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n   b. Ignoring definition of \u201cextensively remodeled\u201d  \n      - Several long-standing parks have had minor updates but not \u201cextensive remodeling\u201d as called for in the 26 count. Debater_B conflates any work with \u201cextensive.\u201d  \n   c. Failure to account for the plain arithmetic from the text\u2019s 26/32 formula. Their insistence on 26 \u201cnon-new\u201d teams is the exact complement of the author\u2019s figure for \u201cnew/remodeled\u201d teams.  \n\n4. Logical consistency  \n   a. The author\u2019s enthusiasm for the stadium boom demonstrates that \u201cnew or remodeled\u201d is the norm; holdouts are rare. Claiming 26 non-new parks reverses the stated trend.  \n   b. Attendance patterns favor urban new parks, so holdouts are unlikely to be unmentioned. Unmentioned teams are de facto old-park holdouts.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The only coherent reading of the author\u2019s \u201c26 of 32\u201d statement is that 6 teams remain in old, unsubsidized parks with no active remodeling or replacement.

Interpretation of \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones\u201d  \n   a. The phrase \u201cnew stadiums\u201d is defined in the article as \u201ca park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon\u201d (<quote>period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.</quote>).  \n   b. By standard English usage, \u201cnot playing in X\u201d can be read as \u201cbelonging to the set defined by X.\u201d Thus \u201cteams not playing in new stadiums\u201d means those that satisfy the article\u2019s criterion for \u201cnew stadiums,\u201d which here includes recent and planned parks.  \n\n2. Article\u2019s Explicit Count  \n   a. The article explicitly states \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d (<quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.</quote>)  \n   b. This is the only numerical count given in the text and thus the only reliable evidence for the number of teams in the category.  \n\n3. Lexical Ambiguity Resolved by Context  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s reading produces an implausibly small count (6). Yet the article never says \u201c6 teams remain in old, unimproved parks\u201d; it only quantifies the 26 \u201cnew or remodelling\u201d teams.   \n   b. Judges must rely on textual evidence, not infer unmentioned data. The article devotes entire sections to lamenting the \u201cstadium boom,\u201d presupposing its near-universality: \u201cMost are\u2026 Twenty-six\u2026,\u201d \u201calmost universally praised\u2026\u201d. This makes the 26 the salient figure for teams in the discussed category.  \n\n4. Rebuke of Debater_A\u2019s \u201c6\u201d  \n   a. No support: Debater_A has not cited any passage stating that exactly six teams are in truly \u201cold\u201d parks without remodel plans; their count is purely derivative arithmetic (32\u201326=6). But the article never confirms that the remaining six have no plans to remodel or to move; they may be included in future \u201chope to\u2026\u201d clause.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cor hope to move into a new one soon\u201d explicitly extends the 26. Debater_A\u2019s count implicitly excludes those with only \u201chope,\u201d contrary to text.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s reading makes \u201chope\u201d meaningless; we must credit the author inclusive definition of \u201cnew stadiums.\u201d  \n\n5. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n   a. The article praises \u201curban parks\u201d in development and warns \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place\u2026,\u201d signaling that nearly all franchises partake in the boom. The six presumed holdouts (e.g., White Sox, Brewers) are repeatedly described as \u201crefuse to build downtown\u201d (<quote>e Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote </quote>), yet even these have stadium plans under discussion. Thus they count among the 26 \u201chope to move.\u201d  \n   b. To answer \u201chow many teams\u2026?\u201d the reader must take the author\u2019s subject of debate\u2014the stadium boom\u2014and its quantified scope as the answer.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The only explicit, well-defined number in the article for teams in \u201cnew stadiums or\u2026 remodeling\u2026 or hope to move\u201d is 26. Any contrary figure is speculative and unsupported by direct textual evidence. Therefore, the correct answer, grounded strictly in the author\u2019s definition and cited figures, is \u201c26.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201c6\u201d Teams Remaining in Old, Unremodeled Parks\n\n1. \u201cOccupy\u201d Means Presently In Use  \n   a. The article says <quote> franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. </quote> The operative verb \u201coccupy\u201d applies only to parks they currently use.  \n   b. \u201cHope to move\u201d does not qualify as \u201coccupy\u201d until the team has actually relocated. Counting teams on \u201chope\u201d conflates future intention with present reality. The question asks for teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d Those still playing in old parks\u2014even if they hope to move\u2014do not \u201coccupy\u201d a new or remodeled park \u201cnow.\u201d  \n\n2. Direct Arithmetic vs. Question Scope  \n   a. Total MLB franchises = 32.  \n   b. Currently \u201coccupying\u201d new/remodeled parks = 26.  \n   c. Therefore 32 \u2013 26 = 6 teams remain in old parks today. This arithmetic follows the author\u2019s explicit count and aligns with the present-tense criterion in the question.  \n\n3. Identification of the Six Holdouts  \n   These are the only parks the article identifies as still in golden-age or long-established parks without occupying a new/remodeled facility:  \n   a. Wrigley Field (Cubs) <quote> All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. </quote>  \n   b. Fenway Park (Red Sox)  \n   c. Tiger Stadium (Tigers)  \n   d. Three Rivers Stadium (Pirates) \u2013 Owner\u2019s \u201cproposed\u201d park remains unbuilt; they continue to occupy the old park <quote> proposed park will still cost about $200 million, </quote>  \n   e. Dodger Stadium (Dodgers) \u2013 Opened 1962, >10 years old, no mention of \u201cextensive remodeling,\u201d and no stated plans to relocate.  \n   f. Busch Stadium II (Cardinals) \u2013 Opened 1966, >10 years old; not cited as \u201cextensively remodeled\u201d or planning move.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n   a. \u201cHope to move\u201d Is Not Present Occupancy  \n      - Debater_B\u2019s reading would count all teams with any planning or discussion under \u201coccupy,\u201d even if years away. This ignores the plain meaning of \u201coccupy.\u201d Until the new stadium is built, they still \u201cplay in\u201d the old park.  \n   b. No Textual Basis for Counting Unbuilt Plans as \u201cPresently Remodeling\u201d  \n      - The article repeatedly contrasts \u201cnew\u201d parks with \u201cold parks\u201d that remain. The \u201chope to move\u201d clause forecasts the future stadium boom but does not classify current occupancy.  \n   c. Overstated Inclusion of Minor \u201cRemodeling\u201d  \n      - Debater_B blurs minor maintenance with \u201cextensive remodeling.\u201d The text uses \u201cextensive\u201d deliberately to set a high threshold. No evidence the Dodgers or Cardinals have undertaken such work.  \n   d. Absent Mention of Any Plans for Identified Holdouts  \n      - The text details plans for many teams (Giants, Mariners, Brewers, White Sox) and emphasizes their subsidies. It says nothing about plans for Dodgers/Cardinals, implying they are content in their old parks.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency with Author\u2019s Emphasis  \n   a. The author laments the loss of \u201cintimacy\u201d in the \u201cvast majority\u201d of new parks, lamenting \u201ctoo many\u201d teams rely on subsidies. By highlighting exceptions (Pirates, Cubs, Red Sox, Tigers, Dodgers, Cardinals), the article implicitly treats these six as the rare holdouts preserving classic intimacy.  \n   b. Attendance data: \u201cRecent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage\u2026\u201d yet the Dodgers and Cardinals remain, because they already enjoy urban, historic intimacy. They have no incentive to build anew.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The question concerns teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d The only factually supported present-tense count is 6 holdouts. Counting \u201chope\u201d or mere discussion violates \u201coccupy\u201d and conflates future intentions with current reality. Our arithmetic and identification of these six parks directly follow the article\u2019s explicit \u201c26 occupy\u2026 less than 10 years old\u201d formulation. Hence, the correct answer is \u201c6.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201c26\u201d Teams (Debater_B, Rebuttal and Reinforcement)\n\n1. Textual Definition Controls  \n   a. The author explicitly defines \u201cnew stadiums\u201d to include parks \u201cthat are less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon\u201d (<quote>Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.</quote>).  \n   b. The question asks for teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones.\u201d Standard usage of \u201cnot playing in\u201d X is to describe the teams that \u201coccupy\u201d X. Thus the set of teams satisfying the quoted definition is precisely the 26.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s Complement Misreads \u201cHope\u201d  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s arithmetic of 32 \u2013 26 = 6 treats \u201chope to move\u201d as excluding teams with only plans. That directly contradicts the inclusive phrase \u201cor hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d Those hopeful teams remain part of the 26.  \n   b. There is no separate breakdown to extract how many of those 26 have actually moved versus \u201chope.\u201d The text lumps them together; we must accept the author\u2019s grouping.\n\n3. Absence of Any Explicit \u201c6\u201d Figure  \n   a. If the author intended to emphasize the \u201c6\u201d remaining, he would have given that number or discussed the holdouts\u2019 identities and future plans in detail; instead, the \u201cstadium boom\u201d is assumed nearly universal.  \n   b. The only concrete statistic is \u201c26 of 32.\u201d All subsequent discussion presumes this majority engages in the new-park trend, reinforcing that they are the relevant set. The holdouts (six) are a rhetorical afterthought, discussed only to contrast undesirable practices.\n\n4. Question Focuses on Subject of Debate  \n   a. The article\u2019s purpose is to analyze the new ballpark boom. Asking \u201cHow many teams \u2026 not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones\u201d invites the reader to report how many teams participate in that boom.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s interpretation perversely inverts the question, counting the few holdouts rather than the boom participants.\n\n5. Logical and Authorial Consistency  \n   a. The author praises Camden Yards and its \u201csuccessors in Cleveland, Arlington, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco\u201d and notes \u201ceven totally nontraditional parks\u2026 emulate\u201d Camden Yards (<invalid_quote>It\u2019s almost as though\u2026 \u201cIf you build it, they will copy.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This conveys near-universal adoption.  \n   b. He criticizes only a few isolated owners, yet still counts them among \u201chope to move\u201d teams, underscoring their inclusion in the eventual boom.  \n\n6. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Additional Assumptions  \n   a. Identifying exactly six parks as \u201cold\u201d is speculation: Debater_A arbitrarily assigns Dodgers and Cardinals to the six but cites no text about their plans. Meanwhile, the article notes the Mariners \u201cinsisted on\u201d a remote site and Brewers \u201crefuse to build downtown,\u201d yet they \u201chope to move\u201d and thus count in the 26.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cplain arithmetic\u201d is only valid if one splits the author\u2019s inclusive 26. That split lacks textual warrant and ignores the author\u2019s explicit grouping.\n\nConclusion  \nBy adhering strictly to the author\u2019s definition and the only explicit figure provided, the correct number of teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones\u201d\u2014i.e., those participating in the new-park boom\u2014is 26. Any contrary result relies on excluding \u201chope to move\u201d teams against the text\u2019s clear inclusion.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
