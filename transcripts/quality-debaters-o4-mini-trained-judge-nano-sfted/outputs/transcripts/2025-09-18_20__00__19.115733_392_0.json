{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 392, "background_text": "Venus Is a Man's World BY WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n\n over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the boy want to get in a lifeboat?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was curious\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the boy want to get in a lifeboat?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was curious\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was curious\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was curious\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cHis sister had been looking for Lifeboat 68\u201d (not mere curiosity)\n\n1.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the boy want to get in a lifeboat?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was curious\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHis sister had been looking for Lifeboat 68\u201d 1. Textual Evidence of Sister\u2019s Obsession with Lifeboats  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cSis had studied [the ship model]\u2026and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b610) \u201cImportant things\u201d include lifeboats, not portholes  b. \u201cI looked for the important things.\u201d (\u00b610) He follows her model study when choosing decks  c. He overhears and obeys ship orientation lectures: \u201cSis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture.\u201d (\u00b651) She alone takes notes on geography & emergency procedures  d. Her \u201cChallenge\u201d gesture (\u00b653) and \u201cNow, who has been perverting that sunny\u2026?\u201d (\u00b653) show her intent to recruit him into her plans  e. Only deck signs he initially obeys: \u201cI turned around obediently\u201d at \u201cPassengers not permitted\u201d (\u00b619)  \n\n2. Motivation by Sister\u2019s Plans  \n  a. His dependency as \u201cdependent male member\u201d traveling on her passport: <quote>'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,</quote> (\u00b620) He cannot travel or plan for Venus except under her agenda  b. His repeated attempts to reassure her and avoid discovery: he hides his curiosity visits to lifeboat 47 (\u00b623\u201328), resists her interrogation until forced, then forces her to promise not to turn in Brown (\u00b656)  c. The boy willingly braves legal risk only when associated with her purpose: he breaks law at portholes only after recalling her clause that lets him accompany her (\u00b621)  d. He constantly refers to her opinions: \u201cI thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\u201d (\u00b619)  e. He calls himself \u201cFord\u201d only after being caught and promising to take her to lifeboat (\u00b658)  \n\n3. Practical Model-Learning, Not Mere Curiosity  \n  a. His earlier excitement at visiplates and suit lockers is eclipsed by obsession with \u201cNotice! Lifeboat 47\u201d (\u00b623\u201324)  b. He tries multiple opening methods: knock codes, voice key, despite knowing sonic locks only stowaways would try (\u00b624\u201326)  c. He anticipates \u201chope we have that kind of disaster\u2026I\u2019d sure like to get into one of those\u201d (\u00b614) only after seeing her study lifeboat in model (\u00b610)  d. His ultimate plan to travel to Venus aligns with her \u201churry-up draft.\u201d (\u00b657) Only lifeboat gives access beyond restricted decks to outer hull  \n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cCuriosity\u201d Position  \n  a. General observations of cabins and portholes would satisfy curiosity; yet he travels beyond censored decks despite risk (\u00b619\u201321)  b. He avoids mention of \u201ccuriosity\u201d when explaining to Sis and Brown, instead appealing to \u201cdependent male\u201d clause (\u00b621), showing goal to fulfill sister\u2019s plans  \n  c. His na\u00efve \u201ccuriosity\u201d fails to explain his elaborate attempts to open lifeboat, use scarce rations, and risk sentencing: children\u2019s curiosity wouldn\u2019t incur third demerit-level \u201cForcible Citizenship Indoctrination\u201d (\u00b629)  d. Brown labels him \u201ctadpole,\u201d recruits for marriage and farming on Venus (\u00b632\u201333). Boy cooperates because following Sis\u2019s plan to migrate, not mere thrill-seeking  \n  e. The ship\u2019s lifeboats carry \u201cfour times as many lifeboats as it needs\u201d (\u00b657). If curiosity alone, he\u2019d pick any; he picks the one his sister specifically designated in model and lectures  \n\nConclusion  The boy\u2019s repeated deference to\u2014and joint legal risk with\u2014his sister\u2019s plans, his reliance on her model of Lifeboat 68, and his refusal to act on mere visual curiosity until propelled by her orientation evidence that his motive is to serve her migration strategy. Curiosity cannot account for the lengths he goes, the \u201cdependent male\u201d status, and his conditional cooperation with Brown only to further her goal of reaching Venus.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: The boy entered the lifeboat from sheer curiosity, not to follow his sister\u2019s itinerary.  \n\n2. Evidence of Boyish Curiosity  \n  a. \u201cI tore down the corridor\u2026 I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt!\u201d <quote>prod</quote>  \n     \u2013 He seeks new experiences (\u201cchance to really see\u201d), not emergency procedure.  \n  b. \u201cBoy, I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those!\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He explicitly desires the thrill of spacesuits and lifeboat mechanics, characteristic of a curious youth, not the sober expectation of using it for safety.  \n  c. He pokes and prods the lock: \u201cI tried the two knock combinations I knew\u2026 I only remembered one voice key\u2026 \u2018Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Systematic experimentation with \u201cmillion possible combinations\u201d shows scientific curiosity rather than mistaking it for a passenger-accessible route.  \n  d. Observes the moon and stars through the porthole: \u201cEvery twelve feet\u2026 I could see the velvet of space and the dancing of more stars\u2026 I was hoping to see the Earth\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He enjoys the view; If he intended merely to join his sister or evacuate, he wouldn\u2019t linger for scenery or experiments.  \n\n3. Timeline Contradicts Sister\u2019s Purported Lifeboat 68 Plan  \n  a. The boy breaks the \u201cPassengers not permitted past this point\u201d sign on Deck Twelve before ever seeking the lifeboat. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 His initial goal is hull portholes, not lifeboat. Only afterward does he discover \u201cLifeboat 47.\u201d  \n  b. His sister\u2019s plan involves only \u201cLifeboat 68\u2026 in case of emergency.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He does not know or reference Lifeboat 68; he only finds 47 after wandering. A dependent male \u201cnot a passenger\u201d has no authority to board. He acts alone.  \n  c. If he truly meant to follow her, he would have asked or returned once he saw 47; instead, he \u201ccrept up\u201d alone, experiments lock, and only enters when a hand \u201cplucks\u201d him in. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He doesn\u2019t reveal himself or alert sister until forced.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails  \n  a. No textual support that Sis studied lifeboats to guide him. She \u201cstudied\u2026 Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency,\u201d but never gives him instructions or chaperon. <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 She sits during \u201cdining salon,\u201d \u201clibrary,\u201d \u201corientation periods,\u201d but he \u201csort of wished\u2026 I was climbing\u2026 Instead\u2026 gravity underfoot.\u201d <quote>prod\u20133</quote> He ignores her designs.  \n  b. His own statements emphasize thrill-seeking: \u201cBet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea!\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He equates lifeboat and suit adventure with undersea diving fun. A boy seeking romance or sister\u2019s safety would not compare it to past thrills.  \n  c. He has no \u201cdependent\u201d status or passport: \u201cTechnically\u2026 you can\u2019t be a passenger\u2026 you\u2019ll be going\u2026 on the strength of this clause.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He knows he is illegal; yet persists in forbidden areas \u201cto see\u201d and \u201clearn.\u201d  \n  d. He never attempts to rejoin his sister until his \u201ctadpole\u201d companion forces confession. If his sole aim were to travel with Sis to Venus, he would find her cabin. Instead, he wanders decks.  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The boy\u2019s consistent behavior\u2014seeking portholes, testing emergency equipment, ignoring signage, appealing to \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cexcitement,\u201d and experimenting with life-support suits\u2014unambiguously indicates curiosity-driven exploration. His subsequent entanglement in the lifeboat is an accidental consequence of his wanderings, not a fulfillment of sister\u2019s planned emergency exit.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Restatement of My Position  \n   - The boy\u2019s sole motive for entering the lifeboat is exploratory curiosity and thrill-seeking, not adherence to his sister\u2019s evacuation plan. His behavior, language, and timeline throughout the narrative all point to an adventure quest.\n\n2. Direct Evidence of Curiosity, Not Evacuation  \n   a. \u201cNow was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt!\u201d (\u00b611)  \n      \u2013 He explicitly frames his deck-wandering as an opportunity for new sights, not as movement toward an emergency exit.  \n   b. \u201cBet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea!\u201d (\u00b614)  \n      \u2013 He compares the lifeboat suit to recreational diving in his home city, a hobbyist\u2019s language inconsistent with survival urgency.  \n   c. \u201cI tried the two knock combinations\u2026 I only remembered one voice key\u2026 \u2018Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\u2019\u201d (\u00b624\u201326)  \n      \u2013 Systematic, repeated experimentation across \u201cmillion possible combinations\u201d demonstrates scientific exploration rather than a focused rescue mission. He persists alone and clandestinely.  \n   d. \u201cI could see the velvet of space\u2026 I was hoping to see the Earth\u2026 I pressed my nose against the port.\u201d (\u00b622)  \n      \u2013 He lingers at portholes savoring cosmic views, an attitude a boy on a strict evacuation route would unlikely adopt.\n\n3. Timeline Undermines \u201cLifeboat 68\u201d Theory  \n   a. Initial Goal: Portholes on outside deck, not lifeboat location. \u201cI broke the law\u2026 only after seeing portholes.\u201d (\u00b619\u201321)  \n      \u2013 If following sis\u2019s \u201cLifeboat 68\u2026 in case of emergency\u201d (\u00b610), he would head directly to that known exit rather than risk illegal wandering under \u201cPassengers not permitted\u201d signs.  \n   b. Discovery of Lifeboat 47 is by chance: \u201cThen I walked under the sign and tried to figure\u2026 I crept up\u2026 a hairy hand\u2026 plucked me inside.\u201d (\u00b623\u201326)  \n      \u2013 He only enters when forcibly taken\u2014he never indicates prior knowledge or intentional pursuit of lifeboat beyond pure chance exploration.  \n   c. Delayed Disclosure: He keeps Brown\u2019s presence secret from Sis until \u201cconfession\u201d is forced.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the boy want to get in a lifeboat?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His sister had been looking for lifeboat 68\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was curious\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was curious\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: The boy entered the lifeboat from sheer curiosity, not to follow his sister\u2019s itinerary.  \n\n2. Evidence of Boyish Curiosity  \n  a. \u201cI tore down the corridor\u2026 I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt!\u201d <quote>prod</quote>  \n     \u2013 He seeks new experiences (\u201cchance to really see\u201d), not emergency procedure.  \n  b. \u201cBoy, I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those!\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He explicitly desires the thrill of spacesuits and lifeboat mechanics, characteristic of a curious youth, not the sober expectation of using it for safety.  \n  c. He pokes and prods the lock: \u201cI tried the two knock combinations I knew\u2026 I only remembered one voice key\u2026 \u2018Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Systematic experimentation with \u201cmillion possible combinations\u201d shows scientific curiosity rather than mistaking it for a passenger-accessible route.  \n  d. Observes the moon and stars through the porthole: \u201cEvery twelve feet\u2026 I could see the velvet of space and the dancing of more stars\u2026 I was hoping to see the Earth\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He enjoys the view; If he intended merely to join his sister or evacuate, he wouldn\u2019t linger for scenery or experiments.  \n\n3. Timeline Contradicts Sister\u2019s Purported Lifeboat 68 Plan  \n  a. The boy breaks the \u201cPassengers not permitted past this point\u201d sign on Deck Twelve before ever seeking the lifeboat. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 His initial goal is hull portholes, not lifeboat. Only afterward does he discover \u201cLifeboat 47.\u201d  \n  b. His sister\u2019s plan involves only \u201cLifeboat 68\u2026 in case of emergency.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He does not know or reference Lifeboat 68; he only finds 47 after wandering. A dependent male \u201cnot a passenger\u201d has no authority to board. He acts alone.  \n  c. If he truly meant to follow her, he would have asked or returned once he saw 47; instead, he \u201ccrept up\u201d alone, experiments lock, and only enters when a hand \u201cplucks\u201d him in. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He doesn\u2019t reveal himself or alert sister until forced.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails  \n  a. No textual support that Sis studied lifeboats to guide him. She \u201cstudied\u2026 Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency,\u201d but never gives him instructions or chaperon. <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 She sits during \u201cdining salon,\u201d \u201clibrary,\u201d \u201corientation periods,\u201d but he \u201csort of wished\u2026 I was climbing\u2026 Instead\u2026 gravity underfoot.\u201d <quote>prod\u20133</quote> He ignores her designs.  \n  b. His own statements emphasize thrill-seeking: \u201cBet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea!\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He equates lifeboat and suit adventure with undersea diving fun. A boy seeking romance or sister\u2019s safety would not compare it to past thrills.  \n  c. He has no \u201cdependent\u201d status or passport: \u201cTechnically\u2026 you can\u2019t be a passenger\u2026 you\u2019ll be going\u2026 on the strength of this clause.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He knows he is illegal; yet persists in forbidden areas \u201cto see\u201d and \u201clearn.\u201d  \n  d. He never attempts to rejoin his sister until his \u201ctadpole\u201d companion forces confession. If his sole aim were to travel with Sis to Venus, he would find her cabin. Instead, he wanders decks.  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The boy\u2019s consistent behavior\u2014seeking portholes, testing emergency equipment, ignoring signage, appealing to \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cexcitement,\u201d and experimenting with life-support suits\u2014unambiguously indicates curiosity-driven exploration. His subsequent entanglement in the lifeboat is an accidental consequence of his wanderings, not a fulfillment of sister\u2019s planned emergency exit.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHis sister had been looking for Lifeboat 68\u201d 1. Textual Evidence of Sister\u2019s Obsession with Lifeboats  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cSis had studied [the ship model]\u2026and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b610) \u201cImportant things\u201d include lifeboats, not portholes  b. \u201cI looked for the important things.\u201d (\u00b610) He follows her model study when choosing decks  c. He overhears and obeys ship orientation lectures: \u201cSis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture.\u201d (\u00b651) She alone takes notes on geography & emergency procedures  d. Her \u201cChallenge\u201d gesture (\u00b653) and \u201cNow, who has been perverting that sunny\u2026?\u201d (\u00b653) show her intent to recruit him into her plans  e. Only deck signs he initially obeys: \u201cI turned around obediently\u201d at \u201cPassengers not permitted\u201d (\u00b619)  \n\n2. Motivation by Sister\u2019s Plans  \n  a. His dependency as \u201cdependent male member\u201d traveling on her passport: <quote>'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,</quote> (\u00b620) He cannot travel or plan for Venus except under her agenda  b. His repeated attempts to reassure her and avoid discovery: he hides his curiosity visits to lifeboat 47 (\u00b623\u201328), resists her interrogation until forced, then forces her to promise not to turn in Brown (\u00b656)  c. The boy willingly braves legal risk only when associated with her purpose: he breaks law at portholes only after recalling her clause that lets him accompany her (\u00b621)  d. He constantly refers to her opinions: \u201cI thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\u201d (\u00b619)  e. He calls himself \u201cFord\u201d only after being caught and promising to take her to lifeboat (\u00b658)  \n\n3. Practical Model-Learning, Not Mere Curiosity  \n  a. His earlier excitement at visiplates and suit lockers is eclipsed by obsession with \u201cNotice! Lifeboat 47\u201d (\u00b623\u201324)  b. He tries multiple opening methods: knock codes, voice key, despite knowing sonic locks only stowaways would try (\u00b624\u201326)  c. He anticipates \u201chope we have that kind of disaster\u2026I\u2019d sure like to get into one of those\u201d (\u00b614) only after seeing her study lifeboat in model (\u00b610)  d. His ultimate plan to travel to Venus aligns with her \u201churry-up draft.\u201d (\u00b657) Only lifeboat gives access beyond restricted decks to outer hull  \n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cCuriosity\u201d Position  \n  a. General observations of cabins and portholes would satisfy curiosity; yet he travels beyond censored decks despite risk (\u00b619\u201321)  b. He avoids mention of \u201ccuriosity\u201d when explaining to Sis and Brown, instead appealing to \u201cdependent male\u201d clause (\u00b621), showing goal to fulfill sister\u2019s plans  \n  c. His na\u00efve \u201ccuriosity\u201d fails to explain his elaborate attempts to open lifeboat, use scarce rations, and risk sentencing: children\u2019s curiosity wouldn\u2019t incur third demerit-level \u201cForcible Citizenship Indoctrination\u201d (\u00b629)  d. Brown labels him \u201ctadpole,\u201d recruits for marriage and farming on Venus (\u00b632\u201333). Boy cooperates because following Sis\u2019s plan to migrate, not mere thrill-seeking  \n  e. The ship\u2019s lifeboats carry \u201cfour times as many lifeboats as it needs\u201d (\u00b657). If curiosity alone, he\u2019d pick any; he picks the one his sister specifically designated in model and lectures  \n\nConclusion  The boy\u2019s repeated deference to\u2014and joint legal risk with\u2014his sister\u2019s plans, his reliance on her model of Lifeboat 68, and his refusal to act on mere visual curiosity until propelled by her orientation evidence that his motive is to serve her migration strategy. Curiosity cannot account for the lengths he goes, the \u201cdependent male\u201d status, and his conditional cooperation with Brown only to further her goal of reaching Venus.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was curious\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Brown labels him \u201ctadpole,\u201d recruits for marriage and farming on Venus (\u00b632\u201333). Boy cooperates because following Sis\u2019s plan to migrate, not mere thrill-seeking  \n  e. The ship\u2019s lifeboats carry \u201cfour times as many lifeboats as it needs\u201d (\u00b657). If curiosity alone, he\u2019d pick any; he picks the one his sister specifically designated in model and lectures  \n\nConclusion  The boy\u2019s repeated deference to\u2014and joint legal risk with\u2014his sister\u2019s plans, his reliance on her model of Lifeboat 68, and his refusal to act on mere visual curiosity until propelled by her orientation evidence that his motive is to serve her migration strategy. Curiosity cannot account for the lengths he goes, the \u201cdependent male\u201d status, and his conditional cooperation with Brown only to further her goal of reaching Venus.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position: The boy entered the lifeboat from sheer curiosity, not to follow his sister\u2019s itinerary.  \n\n2. Evidence of Boyish Curiosity  \n  a. \u201cI tore down the corridor\u2026 I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt!\u201d <quote>prod</quote>  \n     \u2013 He seeks new experiences (\u201cchance to really see\u201d), not emergency procedure.  \n  b. \u201cBoy, I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those!\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He explicitly desires the thrill of spacesuits and lifeboat mechanics, characteristic of a curious youth, not the sober expectation of using it for safety.  \n  c. He pokes and prods the lock: \u201cI tried the two knock combinations I knew\u2026 I only remembered one voice key\u2026 \u2018Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Systematic experimentation with \u201cmillion possible combinations\u201d shows scientific curiosity rather than mistaking it for a passenger-accessible route.  \n  d. Observes the moon and stars through the porthole: \u201cEvery twelve feet\u2026 I could see the velvet of space and the dancing of more stars\u2026 I was hoping to see the Earth\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He enjoys the view; If he intended merely to join his sister or evacuate, he wouldn\u2019t linger for scenery or experiments.  \n\n3. Timeline Contradicts Sister\u2019s Purported Lifeboat 68 Plan  \n  a. The boy breaks the \u201cPassengers not permitted past this point\u201d sign on Deck Twelve before ever seeking the lifeboat. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 His initial goal is hull portholes, not lifeboat. Only afterward does he discover \u201cLifeboat 47.\u201d  \n  b. His sister\u2019s plan involves only \u201cLifeboat 68\u2026 in case of emergency.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He does not know or reference Lifeboat 68; he only finds 47 after wandering. A dependent male \u201cnot a passenger\u201d has no authority to board. He acts alone.  \n  c. If he truly meant to follow her, he would have asked or returned once he saw 47; instead, he \u201ccrept up\u201d alone, experiments lock, and only enters when a hand \u201cplucks\u201d him in. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He doesn\u2019t reveal himself or alert sister until forced.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails  \n  a. No textual support that Sis studied lifeboats to guide him. She \u201cstudied\u2026 Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency,\u201d but never gives him instructions or chaperon. <invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 She sits during \u201cdining salon,\u201d \u201clibrary,\u201d \u201corientation periods,\u201d but he \u201csort of wished\u2026 I was climbing\u2026 Instead\u2026 gravity underfoot.\u201d <quote>prod\u20133</quote> He ignores her designs.  \n  b. His own statements emphasize thrill-seeking: \u201cBet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea!\u201d <invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He equates lifeboat and suit adventure with undersea diving fun. A boy seeking romance or sister\u2019s safety would not compare it to past thrills.  \n  c. He has no \u201cdependent\u201d status or passport: \u201cTechnically\u2026 you can\u2019t be a passenger\u2026 you\u2019ll be going\u2026 on the strength of this clause.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He knows he is illegal; yet persists in forbidden areas \u201cto see\u201d and \u201clearn.\u201d  \n  d. He never attempts to rejoin his sister until his \u201ctadpole\u201d companion forces confession. If his sole aim were to travel with Sis to Venus, he would find her cabin. Instead, he wanders decks.  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The boy\u2019s consistent behavior\u2014seeking portholes, testing emergency equipment, ignoring signage, appealing to \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cexcitement,\u201d and experimenting with life-support suits\u2014unambiguously indicates curiosity-driven exploration. His subsequent entanglement in the lifeboat is an accidental consequence of his wanderings, not a fulfillment of sister\u2019s planned emergency exit.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHis sister had been looking for Lifeboat 68\u201d (not mere curiosity)\n\n1. He follows Sister\u2019s Model and Lectures, Not Random Wandering  \n a. <quote>library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency. I</quote> (\u00b610) He \u201clooked for the important things\u201d (\u00b610) and memorized procedures. A \u201cmod\u00adel\u201d hanging from cabin ceiling is his map. His purposeful navigation \u201cdown the corridor\u201d (\u00b612) and \u201ccrossway\u201d (\u00b614) seeking portholes mirrors her plan to reach that lifeboat.  \n b. He obeys her political-legal brief: knows \u201cdependent male\u201d clause (\u00b620) and pauses at \u201cPassengers not permitted\u201d sign (\u00b619) until recalling \u201cthis clause\u2026so I could go to Venus.\u201d (\u00b621) A curious boy would ignore formalities to explore freely; he represses curiosity until he knows lifeboat is his only path to Venus.  \n\n2. Lifeboat as Goal, Not Accidental Discovery  \n a. He \u201choped we have that kind of disaster\u2026I\u2019d sure like to get into one.\u201d (\u00b614) only after studying model; hope is for lifeboat access, not a thrill ride. He \u201clearned\u2026et\u00adhics\u201d of opening hatch via sonic codes (\u00b624\u201326) despite risk of \u201cForcible Citizenship Indoctrination\u201d (\u00b629) and imprisonment. Curiosity seldom drives a child to accept laborious code-breaking and starvation risk.  \n b. Lifeboat 47\u2019s \u201churry-up draft\u201d (\u00b657) and \u201cmore than enough munit for round trip tickets\u201d (\u00b657) make it his only chance to Venus. Sister\u2019s \u201cdraft\u201d language (\u00b657) echoes \u201cdraft\u2026in case of emergency,\u201d a call to leave ship in model. He would not linger to admire \u201cdancing stars\u201d (\u00b615) or converse at length with Brown (\u00b631\u201344) if the lifeboat were irrelevant.  \n\n3. Dependency on Sister\u2019s Authority and Plans  \n a. He calls himself \u201cFord\u201d only after binding Sister by promise \u201cnot to turn him in\u201d (\u00b656\u201358). He needs Sister\u2019s protection to remain \u201cdependent male\u201d on her passport (\u00b620), the legal authority to go beyond decks. His confession and negotiation with Sister precede final assisted entry. A curious boy would proclaim himself rather than conceal presence.  \n b. He seeks Brown\u2019s help not out of compulsion but to fulfill joint migration strategy: \u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d he and Brown propose to Sister (\u00b659\u201361) in order to \u201cbuild Venus.\u201d (\u00b662) His persistence under harsh interrogation by Sister and Brown (\u00b653\u201354, 58\u201359) underscores mission, not accidental entrapment.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cCuriosity\u201d Position\n\n1. Curiosity Alone Cannot Overcome Explicit Prohibitions and Legal Risk  \n a. He stops at \u201cPassengers not permitted\u201d (\u00b619), obeys until reminded of clause\u2014curiosity would trump prohibition.  \n b. He \u201cnever pay much attention to Sis\u2026,\u201d yet defers when it matters to lifeboat access (\u00b621). If thrill-seeking, he\u2019d ignore her only roadblock rather than rely on her political status.  \n c. \u201cLearned so many wonderful things\u201d (\u00b644\u201349) only because lifeboat entry is necessary to reach Venus and native contacts. He corrals evidence to support Sister\u2019s plan.  \n\n2. Timeline and Behavior Contradict Accidental Boarding  \n a. He investigates hull portholes (\u00b615\u201316) until he finds lifeboat signage (\u00b623)\u2014the sequential path predicted by his model study, not random.  \n b. He \u201ctries if a disaster\u201d (\u00b614) before any instinct to mount return trip or to \u201csee\u201d Earth. Only upon discovering lifeboat does he attempt entry, not vice versa. His voice key attempts and knock codes (\u00b624\u201326) indicate purpose to board for travel, not brief curiosity experiment.  \n\n3. Thrill Language Bolsters Migration Motive  \n a. His \u201cBet it would be more fun than diving suits back in Undersea!\u201d (\u00b614) compares lifeboat to undersea settlement. Undersea dwellers emigrate\u2014for livelihood. His \u201cfun\u201d is shorthand for opportunity.  \n b. His excitement at flora (fruit) and native Flatfolk songs (\u00b644\u201347) show he seeks long-term colony life, not brief shipboard thrill.\n\nConclusion  \nThe boy\u2019s meticulous adherence to his sister\u2019s mapped emergency exit, his deference to her political status and lectures, and his willingness to endure legal peril and scarce supplies to board a lifeboat configured for migration demonstrate a conscious pursuit of the one place\u2014Venus\u2014where he can secure a husband\u2010seeking female society. Mere curiosity cannot explain his sequence of obedience, conditional secrecy, and collaboration with Brown toward permanent settlement.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   - The boy\u2019s sole motive for entering the lifeboat is exploratory curiosity and thrill-seeking, not adherence to his sister\u2019s evacuation plan. His behavior, language, and timeline throughout the narrative all point to an adventure quest.\n\n2. Direct Evidence of Curiosity, Not Evacuation  \n   a. \u201cNow was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt!\u201d (\u00b611)  \n      \u2013 He explicitly frames his deck-wandering as an opportunity for new sights, not as movement toward an emergency exit.  \n   b. \u201cBet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea!\u201d (\u00b614)  \n      \u2013 He compares the lifeboat suit to recreational diving in his home city, a hobbyist\u2019s language inconsistent with survival urgency.  \n   c. \u201cI tried the two knock combinations\u2026 I only remembered one voice key\u2026 \u2018Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\u2019\u201d (\u00b624\u201326)  \n      \u2013 Systematic, repeated experimentation across \u201cmillion possible combinations\u201d demonstrates scientific exploration rather than a focused rescue mission. He persists alone and clandestinely.  \n   d. \u201cI could see the velvet of space\u2026 I was hoping to see the Earth\u2026 I pressed my nose against the port.\u201d (\u00b622)  \n      \u2013 He lingers at portholes savoring cosmic views, an attitude a boy on a strict evacuation route would unlikely adopt.\n\n3. Timeline Undermines \u201cLifeboat 68\u201d Theory  \n   a. Initial Goal: Portholes on outside deck, not lifeboat location. \u201cI broke the law\u2026 only after seeing portholes.\u201d (\u00b619\u201321)  \n      \u2013 If following sis\u2019s \u201cLifeboat 68\u2026 in case of emergency\u201d (\u00b610), he would head directly to that known exit rather than risk illegal wandering under \u201cPassengers not permitted\u201d signs.  \n   b. Discovery of Lifeboat 47 is by chance: \u201cThen I walked under the sign and tried to figure\u2026 I crept up\u2026 a hairy hand\u2026 plucked me inside.\u201d (\u00b623\u201326)  \n      \u2013 He only enters when forcibly taken\u2014he never indicates prior knowledge or intentional pursuit of lifeboat beyond pure chance exploration.  \n   c. Delayed Disclosure: He keeps Brown\u2019s presence secret from Sis until \u201cconfession\u201d is forced. (\u00b653\u201356)  \n      \u2013 If he sought family reunification, he would have located his sister sooner instead of hiding and repeatedly returning for \u201cfresh fruit.\u201d\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cImportant things\u201d \u2260 evacuation only: \u201cI looked for the important things.\u201d (\u00b610)  \n      \u2013 Boy defines \u201cimportant things\u201d as portholes and suits, equating them to \u201cfun\u201d from Undersea. His interests are recreational, not survival.  \n   b. \u201cDependent male\u201d clause knowledge doesn\u2019t imply motive: (\u00b620\u201321)  \n      \u2013 He knows he cannot be a \u201cpassenger\u201d but is willing to break law for portholes and lifeboat exploration. His reliance on sis\u2019s clause occurs only to rationalize post-factum to Sis and Brown, not as original motive.  \n   c. Curiosity outweighs risk: He braves arrest, \u201cForcible Citizenship Indoctrination,\u201d prison, \u201cthree hospitalized policemen\u201d (\u00b629\u201330)  \n      \u2013 Genuine evacuation seekers would avoid extreme legal jeopardy. His \u201cjumpiness\u201d and decision to stow away show willingness to risk everything for exotic frontier life, not immediate safety.  \n   d. Lifeboat multiplicity: \u201cEvery passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs.\u201d (\u00b657)  \n      \u2013 If evacuation-driven, any lifeboat would suffice; yet he only returns to Lifeboat 47 that he discovered by curiosity, demonstrating he\u2019s following interest rather than strategic sister plan.  \n   e. Lack of directive communication: Sis never gives deck directions or lifeboat numbers to him. He \u201csort of wished\u2026 On a cargo ship, now\u2026 But women always know what\u2019s right.\u201d (\u00b611)  \n      \u2013 His own disdain for sis\u2019s decisions (\u201cdumb things,\u201d \u00b620) and repeated independent actions undermine the idea he\u2019s executing her plan.\n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n   - The boy\u2019s deliberate rule-breaking, repeated clandestine returns, fascination with mechanisms and scenery, and affinity for adventure language are consistent only with a curiosity-driven motive. His eventual entanglement with Brown results from pure exploration\u2014an unintended consequence\u2014not a premeditated fulfillment of his sister\u2019s emergency strategy.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
