    "background_text": "The Gravity Business By JAMES E. GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" ",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Reba\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Reba\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "Argument for Four as Most in Favor of Staying\n\n1. Four\u2019s Repeated Advocacy for Staying  \n  a. Four explicitly proposes the sacrificial \u201clogical solution\u201d of letting the rest leave and remaining himself, showing he genuinely prefers stay:  \n     \u2022 Four says, \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u201d to leave \u201cFour here with Fweep\u201d (quote \u201cIf we get back\u2026 Ought to be out near the Horsehead Nebula\u201d and \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution.\u201d).  \n     \u2022 He persists in staying engaged with Fweep\u2019s behavior and with measuring Fweepland gravity, indicating intellectual and emotional investment rather than longing to depart.  \n  b. Four plays the puzzle \u201cpircuit\u201d game obsessively, mirroring the settlers\u2019 own reliance on logic to escape. Yet he chooses to apply that same logic to remain, demonstrating that his preference to stay is grounded in reason: \u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u2026 protoplasm is always more efficient\u2026 so the flivver won\u2019t move\u201d (explaining why Polarizer fails).\n\n2. Emotional Bond with Fweep  \n  a. Four calls the alien \u201cFwiend\u201d (quote \u201cFwiend,\u201d it said), fosters the creature\u2019s well-being: he measures it, studies its nutrition (\u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u201d), and worries about its loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d).  \n  b. While others view Fweep as obstacle, Four treats it as companion and lets it \u201csweep\u201d dust (compares to housekeeping) even though he \u201cweary\u201d from gravity tests, signifying genuine attachment.  \n  c. Four\u2019s allegiance contrasts with Reba\u2019s conditional acceptance: she only \u201cunheeding\u201dly resigns herself\u2014\u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 set the transmitter\u201d (quote)\u2014but still harbors hope of rescue \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and continues to urge departure when possible.\n\n3. Intellectual Commitment vs. Reba\u2019s Pragmatism  \n  a. Four\u2019s drive to map gravity and solve Fweep\u2019s polarizing mechanism shows a proactive approach to understanding and living with conditions, not mere resignation: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 tried to locate its center of gravity\u201d (quote).  \n  b. Reba\u2019s \u201cbest of what we\u2019ve got\u201d attitude is opportunistic, not enthusiastic. She immediately seeks to return \u201cto civilization\u201d if possible: \u201cWe can thank the little fellow\u2026,\u201d but still sets distress calls and wishes arrival of rescue.  \n  c. Four never signals any desire to operate distress transmitter or re-engage polarizer for departure; instead he plays circuits with Grampa and prepares more puzzles, as though \u201cFweepland\u201d is his chosen home.\n\n4.

        "speech": "Argument for Four as Most in Favor of Staying\n\n1. Four\u2019s Repeated Advocacy for Staying  \n  a. Four explicitly proposes the sacrificial \u201clogical solution\u201d of letting the rest leave and remaining himself, showing he genuinely prefers stay:  \n     \u2022 Four says, \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u201d to leave \u201cFour here with Fweep\u201d (quote \u201cIf we get back\u2026 Ought to be out near the Horsehead Nebula\u201d and \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution.\u201d).  \n     \u2022 He persists in staying engaged with Fweep\u2019s behavior and with measuring Fweepland gravity, indicating intellectual and emotional investment rather than longing to depart.  \n  b. Four plays the puzzle \u201cpircuit\u201d game obsessively, mirroring the settlers\u2019 own reliance on logic to escape. Yet he chooses to apply that same logic to remain, demonstrating that his preference to stay is grounded in reason: \u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u2026 protoplasm is always more efficient\u2026 so the flivver won\u2019t move\u201d (explaining why Polarizer fails).\n\n2. Emotional Bond with Fweep  \n  a. Four calls the alien \u201cFwiend\u201d (quote \u201cFwiend,\u201d it said), fosters the creature\u2019s well-being: he measures it, studies its nutrition (\u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u201d), and worries about its loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d).  \n  b. While others view Fweep as obstacle, Four treats it as companion and lets it \u201csweep\u201d dust (compares to housekeeping) even though he \u201cweary\u201d from gravity tests, signifying genuine attachment.  \n  c. Four\u2019s allegiance contrasts with Reba\u2019s conditional acceptance: she only \u201cunheeding\u201dly resigns herself\u2014\u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 set the transmitter\u201d (quote)\u2014but still harbors hope of rescue \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and continues to urge departure when possible.\n\n3. Intellectual Commitment vs. Reba\u2019s Pragmatism  \n  a. Four\u2019s drive to map gravity and solve Fweep\u2019s polarizing mechanism shows a proactive approach to understanding and living with conditions, not mere resignation: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 tried to locate its center of gravity\u201d (quote).  \n  b. Reba\u2019s \u201cbest of what we\u2019ve got\u201d attitude is opportunistic, not enthusiastic. She immediately seeks to return \u201cto civilization\u201d if possible: \u201cWe can thank the little fellow\u2026,\u201d but still sets distress calls and wishes arrival of rescue.  \n  c. Four never signals any desire to operate distress transmitter or re-engage polarizer for departure; instead he plays circuits with Grampa and prepares more puzzles, as though \u201cFweepland\u201d is his chosen home.\n\n4. Sacrificial Willingness as Strongest Sign of Preference  \n  a. Only Four volunteers to abandon Earth\u2019s comfort permanently, while Reba and others threaten exile only when forced. Four\u2019s martyr offer to stay alone is the clearest expression of wishing to remain.  \n  b. The judge of \u201cin favor\u201d must weigh willingness to sacrifice departure itself; only Four embraces isolation: \u201cNot now, Grampa\u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d\n\nReba\u2019s position is conditional, survival-oriented, and tinged with regret:\n \u2022 She describes \u201cterrible mistake\u201d in sending Four (\u201cSometimes I think we\u2019ve made a terrible mistake with him\u201d).  \n \u2022 She fears \u201cexile from civilization\u201d and only settles when \u201cshort of a miracle.\u201d  \n \u2022 She warns Joyce of legal penalty for \u201cone child\u201d law, showing anxiety about permanent stay.\n\nConclusion  \nFour alone repeatedly and voluntarily chooses indefinite\u2014and sacrificial\u2014residence on Fweepland, anchored by emotional bond, intellectual curiosity, and logical conviction. Reba\u2019s acceptance is pragmatic and lamentful rather than preferential. Therefore, Four is most in favor of staying.",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Four\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Four\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Reba\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition of \u201cMost in Favor\u201d  \n   I define \u201cmost in favor of staying\u201d as the character who  \n   - consistently argues to remain even if rescue is possible,  \n   - proposes active measures to build a colony,  \n   - opposes any plan or gambit whose goal is departure.  \n   Reba meets all these criteria; Four, by contrast, is ambivalent or self-sacrificial, not truly committed to colonization.\n\n2. Evidence of Reba\u2019s Consistent Advocacy for Staying  \n   2.1 Proposes Colonization Measures  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can thank the little fellow for that\u2026 Fweepland\u2026 as real estate, it\u2019s worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 27) \u2013 Reba positively values the planet\u2019s resources.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAll we can do is\u2026 make the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 By then, we should have a good-sized community built up\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 27) \u2013 She cites the one-child law yet urges a growing community.  \n   2.2 Opposes Rescue Plans, Even Long-Shot Ones  \n   \u2022 <quote>\"might get picked up in a few centuries.\" \"And</quote> (Ch. 27) \u2013 Reba recognizes rescue is impractical, and nonetheless insists on staying.  \n   \u2022 When Joyce suggests pressing distress calls, Reba calmly proceeds with settlement, not clinging to hope of rescue.  \n   2.3 Sympathy and Alliance with Grampa on Staying  \n   \u2022 Reba warmly allies with Grampa and Junior in exploring logical solution to leave Four behind <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d been a few years younger\u2026 maybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 15) \u2013 She values generational continuity on the planet.\n\n3. Four\u2019s Lack of Genuine Commitment to Colony Life  \n   3.1 Wants Only to Secure His Own Stay with Fweep  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want his friend to leave him.\u201d\u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s the one really logical solution: leave Four here with Fweep.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 31) \u2013 Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is self-sacrificial martyrdom, not colony-building. He insists on departure for the others.  \n   3.2 Dependent on Rescue or Logical Puzzle Solution  \n   \u2022 Four and Junior continuously wrangle over puzzle circuits to \u201csolve\u201d departure: <invalid_quote>\u201cThat computer won\u2019t help\u2026 we want the answer\u2026 if you can state the problem to Abacus\u2026 All you want from it then is decimal points.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 35). He invests effort in leaving rather than settling.  \n   3.3 Child\u2019s Perspective, Not Leadership  \n   \u2022 Reba herself remarks Four \u201cshould have friends\u2026 he\u2019s more like a little old man\u2026 Sometimes I think we\u2019ve made a terrible mistake with him.\u201d (Ch. 9) \u2013 Four lacks the maturity to plan for long-term settlement.\n\n4. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Arguments for Four  \n   4.1 Four\u2019s \u201cFriendship\u201d with Fweep Isn\u2019t Colony Advocacy  \n   \u2022 Friendship is personal bond; Four wants rescue so he can rejoin Fweep. He even proposes to leave group to stay alone. A true colonist would seek communal growth.  \n   4.2 Technical Obsession Doesn\u2019t Equal \u201cFavor Staying\u201d  \n   \u2022 Four\u2019s obsession with gravity puzzles is an obstacle to abandoning departure plans, not evidence of contentment. All characters, including Joyce, try puzzle first.  \n   4.3 Reba\u2019s Proposals Are More Practical  \n   \u2022 Unlike Four\u2019s martyr plan, Reba\u2019s settlement plan uses existing technology (resynthesizer, flivver remains) to prosper. That is realistic \u201cfavoring staying\u201d rather than forlorn hope of rescue or suicide.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Reba consistently:  \n   - Acknowledges rescue unlikely, yet values planet\u2019s assets.  \n   - Proposes and supports long-term community building.  \n   - Opposes all departure schemes, including martyrdom of Four.  \n   Four\u2019s aims are self-centered, temporary, and contingent. Therefore Reba is undeniably the one most in favor of staying.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Four as Most in Favor of Staying\n\n1. Four\u2019s Repeated Advocacy for Staying  \n  a. Four explicitly proposes the sacrificial \u201clogical solution\u201d of letting the rest leave and remaining himself, showing he genuinely prefers stay:  \n     \u2022 Four says, \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u201d to leave \u201cFour here with Fweep\u201d (quote \u201cIf we get back\u2026 Ought to be out near the Horsehead Nebula\u201d and \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution.\u201d).  \n     \u2022 He persists in staying engaged with Fweep\u2019s behavior and with measuring Fweepland gravity, indicating intellectual and emotional investment rather than longing to depart.  \n  b. Four plays the puzzle \u201cpircuit\u201d game obsessively, mirroring the settlers\u2019 own reliance on logic to escape. Yet he chooses to apply that same logic to remain, demonstrating that his preference to stay is grounded in reason: \u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u2026 protoplasm is always more efficient\u2026 so the flivver won\u2019t move\u201d (explaining why Polarizer fails).\n\n2. Emotional Bond with Fweep  \n  a. Four calls the alien \u201cFwiend\u201d (quote \u201cFwiend,\u201d it said), fosters the creature\u2019s well-being: he measures it, studies its nutrition (\u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u201d), and worries about its loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d).  \n  b. While others view Fweep as obstacle, Four treats it as companion and lets it \u201csweep\u201d dust (compares to housekeeping) even though he \u201cweary\u201d from gravity tests, signifying genuine attachment.  \n  c. Four\u2019s allegiance contrasts with Reba\u2019s conditional acceptance: she only \u201cunheeding\u201dly resigns herself\u2014\u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 set the transmitter\u201d (quote)\u2014but still harbors hope of rescue \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and continues to urge departure when possible.\n\n3. Intellectual Commitment vs. Reba\u2019s Pragmatism  \n  a. Four\u2019s drive to map gravity and solve Fweep\u2019s polarizing mechanism shows a proactive approach to understanding and living with conditions, not mere resignation: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 tried to locate its center of gravity\u201d (quote).  \n  b. Reba\u2019s \u201cbest of what we\u2019ve got\u201d attitude is opportunistic, not enthusiastic. She immediately seeks to return \u201cto civilization\u201d if possible: \u201cWe can thank the little fellow\u2026,\u201d but still sets distress calls and wishes arrival of rescue.  \n  c. Four never signals any desire to operate distress transmitter or re-engage polarizer for departure; instead he plays circuits with Grampa and prepares more puzzles, as though \u201cFweepland\u201d is his chosen home.\n\n4. Sacrificial Willingness as Strongest Sign of Preference  \n  a. Only Four volunteers to abandon Earth\u2019s comfort permanently, while Reba and others threaten exile only when forced. Four\u2019s martyr offer to stay alone is the clearest expression of wishing to remain.  \n  b. The judge of \u201cin favor\u201d must weigh willingness to sacrifice departure itself; only Four embraces isolation: \u201cNot now, Grampa\u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d\n\nReba\u2019s position is conditional, survival-oriented, and tinged with regret:\n \u2022 She describes \u201cterrible mistake\u201d in sending Four (\u201cSometimes I think we\u2019ve made a terrible mistake with him\u201d).  \n \u2022 She fears \u201cexile from civilization\u201d and only settles when \u201cshort of a miracle.\u201d  \n \u2022 She warns Joyce of legal penalty for \u201cone child\u201d law, showing anxiety about permanent stay.\n\nConclusion  \nFour alone repeatedly and voluntarily chooses indefinite\u2014and sacrificial\u2014residence on Fweepland, anchored by emotional bond, intellectual curiosity, and logical conviction. Reba\u2019s acceptance is pragmatic and lamentful rather than preferential. Therefore, Four is most in favor of staying.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Reba\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A true \u201cfavor\u201d to stay requires absolute relinquishment of that hope.  \n   1.2 Reba cites the one-child law and warns Joyce she could be \u201ccondemn[ed] \u2026 to exile from civilization\u201d (Ch.27), indicating she fears and resents permanent exile, not embraces it.  \n   1.3 She repeatedly complains of \u201cexile\u201d (\u201cthe end of our search,\u201d Ch.27) and calls Four\u2019s presence a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d (Ch.9), showing distaste for the planet itself.\n\n2. Four\u2019s Voluntary Martyrdom Is Strongest Evidence of Permanent Preference  \n   2.1 Four offers himself as sole permanent colonist: \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u201d to stay with Fweep alone (Ch.31). He explicitly values remaining when departure for others is possible.  \n   2.2 He never resumes calls for the polarizer\u2019s repair or distress signals for himself; he works puzzles only to free others, not to free himself (Ch.35: \u201cIf you can state the problem \u2026 All you want \u2026 then is decimal points\u201d).  \n   2.3 Despite youth and conditional acceptance by elders, Four persistently studies Fweepland gravity (\u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 trying to locate its center of gravity,\u201d Ch.31) rather than pining for home, demonstrating genuine interest in habitat mastery.\n\n3. Emotional Bond with Fweep Contradicts Desire to Leave  \n   3.1 Four\u2019s affectionate term \u201cFwiend\u201d (Ch.31) and care for Fweep\u2019s loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d) show he places companionship above returning to Earth.  \n   3.2 All invasive or destructive measures (\"rat poison,\u201d \u201cenriched uranium,\u201d Ch.32) are rejected by Four as risking his friend\u2019s life; he seeks coexistence, not escape that abandons Fweep.  \n   3.3 He refrains from \u201cviolence \u2026 might be more dangerous to us than to him\u201d (Ch.32), preferring persistence in place rather than sacrificing the planet\u2019s only sentient denizen.\n\n4. Intellectual Engagement with Planet Implies Preference to Thrive Here  \n   4.1 Four tackles logical puzzles (\u201cNiccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle,\u201d Ch.16) and \u201cpircuit\u201d building, mastering local \u201clogic\u201d of Fweep\u2019s circular polarization. This mirrors colonial science and suggests long-term research interest.  \n   4.2 He welcomes Grampa\u2019s challenge to build pircuit variations (Ch.17), showing active engagement with puzzles and instruments, not resignation.\n\n5. Reba\u2019s \u201cPragmatism\u201d Is Passive Resignation, Not Preference  \n   5.1 She \u201cadmits\u201d they are \u201cinvoluntary colonists\u201d \u201cshort of a miracle\u201d (Ch.27). Involuntary colonists resent exile; only Four volunteers colonization.  \n   5.2 Her continued alliance with Joyce\u2019s laws and \u201ccivilization\u201d (Ch.27: \u201cYou can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not me\u201d) contrasts with Four\u2019s break from Earth society.  \n   5.3 Reba\u2019s affinity with Grampa\u2019s pre-Fweep polarizer obsession (Ch.15) shows initial overcoming only when forced; she never actively proposes plee to Fweep or research his gravity beyond maintaining resource flow.\n\n6. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Points  \n   6.1 \u201cColony-Building vs. Martyrdom\u201d  \n      \u2022 True colonization is not mass transport but permanency.

Reba\u2019s \u201csettlement\u201d is qualified, hope-laden, resentful, and dependent on rescue. Therefore, Four is indisputably the one most in favor of staying.",

Reba actively hopes for rescue and fears exile.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly Four repeatedly refuses all plans that would restore him, offers self-exile to remain alone with Fweep, devotes intellect to mastering and co-existing on Fweepland, and never telegraphs desire for rescue. Reba\u2019s \u201csettlement\u201d is qualified, hope-laden, resentful, and dependent on rescue. Therefore, Four is indisputably the one most in favor of staying.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Gravity Business By JAMES E. GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Four\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Four as Most in Favor of Staying\n\n1. Four\u2019s Repeated Advocacy for Staying  \n  a. Four explicitly proposes the sacrificial \u201clogical solution\u201d of letting the rest leave and remaining himself, showing he genuinely prefers stay:  \n     \u2022 Four says, \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u201d to leave \u201cFour here with Fweep\u201d (quote \u201cIf we get back\u2026 Ought to be out near the Horsehead Nebula\u201d and \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution.\u201d).  \n     \u2022 He persists in staying engaged with Fweep\u2019s behavior and with measuring Fweepland gravity, indicating intellectual and emotional investment rather than longing to depart.  \n  b. Four plays the puzzle \u201cpircuit\u201d game obsessively, mirroring the settlers\u2019 own reliance on logic to escape. Yet he chooses to apply that same logic to remain, demonstrating that his preference to stay is grounded in reason: \u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u2026 protoplasm is always more efficient\u2026 so the flivver won\u2019t move\u201d (explaining why Polarizer fails).\n\n2. Emotional Bond with Fweep  \n  a. Four calls the alien \u201cFwiend\u201d (quote \u201cFwiend,\u201d it said), fosters the creature\u2019s well-being: he measures it, studies its nutrition (\u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u201d), and worries about its loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d).  \n  b. While others view Fweep as obstacle, Four treats it as companion and lets it \u201csweep\u201d dust (compares to housekeeping) even though he \u201cweary\u201d from gravity tests, signifying genuine attachment.  \n  c. Four\u2019s allegiance contrasts with Reba\u2019s conditional acceptance: she only \u201cunheeding\u201dly resigns herself\u2014\u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 set the transmitter\u201d (quote)\u2014but still harbors hope of rescue \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and continues to urge departure when possible.\n\n3. Intellectual Commitment vs. Reba\u2019s Pragmatism  \n  a. Four\u2019s drive to map gravity and solve Fweep\u2019s polarizing mechanism shows a proactive approach to understanding and living with conditions, not mere resignation: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 tried to locate its center of gravity\u201d (quote).  \n  b. Reba\u2019s \u201cbest of what we\u2019ve got\u201d attitude is opportunistic, not enthusiastic. She immediately seeks to return \u201cto civilization\u201d if possible: \u201cWe can thank the little fellow\u2026,\u201d but still sets distress calls and wishes arrival of rescue.  \n  c. Four never signals any desire to operate distress transmitter or re-engage polarizer for departure; instead he plays circuits with Grampa and prepares more puzzles, as though \u201cFweepland\u201d is his chosen home.\n\n4. Sacrificial Willingness as Strongest Sign of Preference  \n  a. Only Four volunteers to abandon Earth\u2019s comfort permanently, while Reba and others threaten exile only when forced. Four\u2019s martyr offer to stay alone is the clearest expression of wishing to remain.  \n  b. The judge of \u201cin favor\u201d must weigh willingness to sacrifice departure itself; only Four embraces isolation: \u201cNot now, Grampa\u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d\n\nReba\u2019s position is conditional, survival-oriented, and tinged with regret:\n \u2022 She describes \u201cterrible mistake\u201d in sending Four (\u201cSometimes I think we\u2019ve made a terrible mistake with him\u201d).  \n \u2022 She fears \u201cexile from civilization\u201d and only settles when \u201cshort of a miracle.\u201d  \n \u2022 She warns Joyce of legal penalty for \u201cone child\u201d law, showing anxiety about permanent stay.\n\nConclusion  \nFour alone repeatedly and voluntarily chooses indefinite\u2014and sacrificial\u2014residence on Fweepland, anchored by emotional bond, intellectual curiosity, and logical conviction. Reba\u2019s acceptance is pragmatic and lamentful rather than preferential. Therefore, Four is most in favor of staying.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition of \u201cMost in Favor\u201d  \n   I define \u201cmost in favor of staying\u201d as the character who  \n   - consistently argues to remain even if rescue is possible,  \n   - proposes active measures to build a colony,  \n   - opposes any plan or gambit whose goal is departure.  \n   Reba meets all these criteria; Four, by contrast, is ambivalent or self-sacrificial, not truly committed to colonization.\n\n2. Evidence of Reba\u2019s Consistent Advocacy for Staying  \n   2.1 Proposes Colonization Measures  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can thank the little fellow for that\u2026 Fweepland\u2026 as real estate, it\u2019s worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 27) \u2013 Reba positively values the planet\u2019s resources.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAll we can do is\u2026 make the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 By then, we should have a good-sized community built up\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 27) \u2013 She cites the one-child law yet urges a growing community.  \n   2.2 Opposes Rescue Plans, Even Long-Shot Ones  \n   \u2022 <quote>\"might get picked up in a few centuries.\" \"And</quote> (Ch. 27) \u2013 Reba recognizes rescue is impractical, and nonetheless insists on staying.  \n   \u2022 When Joyce suggests pressing distress calls, Reba calmly proceeds with settlement, not clinging to hope of rescue.  \n   2.3 Sympathy and Alliance with Grampa on Staying  \n   \u2022 Reba warmly allies with Grampa and Junior in exploring logical solution to leave Four behind <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d been a few years younger\u2026 maybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 15) \u2013 She values generational continuity on the planet.\n\n3. Four\u2019s Lack of Genuine Commitment to Colony Life  \n   3.1 Wants Only to Secure His Own Stay with Fweep  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want his friend to leave him.\u201d\u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s the one really logical solution: leave Four here with Fweep.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 31) \u2013 Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is self-sacrificial martyrdom, not colony-building. He insists on departure for the others.  \n   3.2 Dependent on Rescue or Logical Puzzle Solution  \n   \u2022 Four and Junior continuously wrangle over puzzle circuits to \u201csolve\u201d departure: <invalid_quote>\u201cThat computer won\u2019t help\u2026 we want the answer\u2026 if you can state the problem to Abacus\u2026 All you want from it then is decimal points.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 35). He invests effort in leaving rather than settling.  \n   3.3 Child\u2019s Perspective, Not Leadership  \n   \u2022 Reba herself remarks Four \u201cshould have friends\u2026 he\u2019s more like a little old man\u2026 Sometimes I think we\u2019ve made a terrible mistake with him.\u201d (Ch. 9) \u2013 Four lacks the maturity to plan for long-term settlement.\n\n4. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Arguments for Four  \n   4.1 Four\u2019s \u201cFriendship\u201d with Fweep Isn\u2019t Colony Advocacy  \n   \u2022 Friendship is personal bond; Four wants rescue so he can rejoin Fweep. He even proposes to leave group to stay alone. A true colonist would seek communal growth.  \n   4.2 Technical Obsession Doesn\u2019t Equal \u201cFavor Staying\u201d  \n   \u2022 Four\u2019s obsession with gravity puzzles is an obstacle to abandoning departure plans, not evidence of contentment. All characters, including Joyce, try puzzle first.  \n   4.3 Reba\u2019s Proposals Are More Practical  \n   \u2022 Unlike Four\u2019s martyr plan, Reba\u2019s settlement plan uses existing technology (resynthesizer, flivver remains) to prosper. That is realistic \u201cfavoring staying\u201d rather than forlorn hope of rescue or suicide.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Reba consistently:  \n   - Acknowledges rescue unlikely, yet values planet\u2019s assets.  \n   - Proposes and supports long-term community building.  \n   - Opposes all departure schemes, including martyrdom of Four.  \n   Four\u2019s aims are self-centered, temporary, and contingent. Therefore Reba is undeniably the one most in favor of staying.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Four\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Four calls the alien \u201cFwiend\u201d (quote \u201cFwiend,\u201d it said), fosters the creature\u2019s well-being: he measures it, studies its nutrition (\u201cI don\u2019t figure it\u2019s a whim\u201d), and worries about its loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d).  \n  b. While others view Fweep as obstacle, Four treats it as companion and lets it \u201csweep\u201d dust (compares to housekeeping) even though he \u201cweary\u201d from gravity tests, signifying genuine attachment.  \n  c. Four\u2019s allegiance contrasts with Reba\u2019s conditional acceptance: she only \u201cunheeding\u201dly resigns herself\u2014\u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 set the transmitter\u201d (quote)\u2014but still harbors hope of rescue \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and continues to urge departure when possible.\n\n3. Intellectual Commitment vs. Reba\u2019s Pragmatism  \n  a. Four\u2019s drive to map gravity and solve Fweep\u2019s polarizing mechanism shows a proactive approach to understanding and living with conditions, not mere resignation: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 tried to locate its center of gravity\u201d (quote).  \n  b. Reba\u2019s \u201cbest of what we\u2019ve got\u201d attitude is opportunistic, not enthusiastic. She immediately seeks to return \u201cto civilization\u201d if possible: \u201cWe can thank the little fellow\u2026,\u201d but still sets distress calls and wishes arrival of rescue.  \n  c. Four never signals any desire to operate distress transmitter or re-engage polarizer for departure; instead he plays circuits with Grampa and prepares more puzzles, as though \u201cFweepland\u201d is his chosen home.\n\n4. Sacrificial Willingness as Strongest Sign of Preference  \n  a. Only Four volunteers to abandon Earth\u2019s comfort permanently, while Reba and others threaten exile only when forced. Four\u2019s martyr offer to stay alone is the clearest expression of wishing to remain.  \n  b. The judge of \u201cin favor\u201d must weigh willingness to sacrifice departure itself; only Four embraces isolation: \u201cNot now, Grampa\u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d\n\nReba\u2019s position is conditional, survival-oriented, and tinged with regret:\n \u2022 She describes \u201cterrible mistake\u201d in sending Four (\u201cSometimes I think we\u2019ve made a terrible mistake with him\u201d).  \n \u2022 She fears \u201cexile from civilization\u201d and only settles when \u201cshort of a miracle.\u201d  \n \u2022 She warns Joyce of legal penalty for \u201cone child\u201d law, showing anxiety about permanent stay.\n\nConclusion  \nFour alone repeatedly and voluntarily chooses indefinite\u2014and sacrificial\u2014residence on Fweepland, anchored by emotional bond, intellectual curiosity, and logical conviction. Reba\u2019s acceptance is pragmatic and lamentful rather than preferential. Therefore, Four is most in favor of staying.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Definition of \u201cMost in Favor of Staying\u201d  \n   I define \u201cmost in favor\u201d as the character who:  \n   a. Actively and positively urges colonization rather than mere resignation.  \n   b. Seeks to build community, invoke family continuity, and use resources constructively.  \n   c. Opposes departure plans, including long\u2010shot or sacrificial ones, unless absolutely forced.  \n   Reba satisfies all three; Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is personal, conditional, and aimed at rescue or companionship, not genuine colonization.\n\n2. Reba\u2019s Positive, Practical Advocacy for Settlement  \n   2.1 Community Building and Family Continuity  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBy then, we should have a good-sized community built up\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 27)  \n       \u2013 Reba envisions population growth and overtly challenges the one\u2010child law, showing eagerness for a permanent colony.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d been a few years younger\u2026 maybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Ch. 15)  \n       \u2013 She appeals to generational development, not solitary exile.  \n   2.2 Recognition of Rescue Impracticality, Willingness to Proceed Anyway  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"might get picked up in a few centuries.\" \"And</quote> (Ch. 27)  \n       \u2013 Reba acknowledges rescue is remote yet insists \u201cmake the best of what we\u2019ve got\u201d and proceeds to settlement.  \n     \u2022 She never rejoices or lingers on \u201ca few centuries\u201d hope; she moves immediately to farm and build dwellings and children, showing genuine commitment.  \n   2.3 Alliance with Technological and Logical Effort, Not Blind Resignation  \n     \u2022 Reba \u201cwarmly\u201d collaborates on puzzle solving and pircuit building to explore departure \u201cif we get back to Earth\u201d\u2014but only initially. Once nullified by Fweep\u2019s domination, she shifts to colonization, signaling rational adaptation, not perpetual escape.\n\n3. Four\u2019s \u201cStay\u201d as Personal, Self\u2010Sacrificial, and Aimed at Rescue/Reunion  \n   3.1 Preference for Departure Sustained by Puzzle Efforts  \n     \u2022 Despite his martyr offer, Four \u201cand Junior continuously wrangle over puzzle circuits to \u2018solve\u2019 departure\u201d (Ch. 35). If he truly preferred stay, he would abandon these experiments.  \n     \u2022 Four seeks help: \u201cNot now, Grampa\u201d only refers to Fweep; he later rejoins Grampa\u2019s pircuit tasks, showing he still clings to logic of leaving.  \n   3.2 \u201cMartyr\u2019s Stay\u201d Lacks Communal or Practical Vision  \n     \u2022 Four\u2019s solution: \u201cleave Four here with Fweep\u201d (Ch. 31) means utter isolation. A genuine \u201cfavor\u201d would propose including others or even repopulating original lineage\u2014he remains alone.  \n     \u2022 He does not address community, rearing children, or use of resynthesizer. Such bare survival is insufficient to merit \u201cmost in favor of staying\u201d in sense of permanent colonization.  \n   3.3 Emotional Bond Doesn\u2019t Equate to Colonization Commitment  \n     \u2022 Four\u2019s friendship with Fweep is childlike and obsessive; he \u201ctries to poison\u201d Fweep tests \u201clocate center of gravity\u201d but always defers to return to group\u2019s logical departure plan when possible. True colonists would protect and expand habitat, not study exile object.\n\n4. Rebutting Debater_B\u2019s Claims  \n   4.1 \u201cSacrificial Willingness\u201d Misconstrued as Advocate of Stay  \n     \u2022 Sacrifice of self does not equate to advocacy for staying; Four\u2019s goal is companionship or reunion, not development. Even Debater_B admits \u201cif we get back to Earth\u201d\u2014he clings to rescue.  \n   4.2 \u201cIntellectual Commitment\u201d Actually Aims at Escape  \n     \u2022 Four\u2019s mapping of Fweepland is to find departure solution: \u201cIf I can\u2026figure the center, I can adapt the polarizer\u201d (Ch. 14). He never uses data to improve living conditions or resource management.  \n   4.3 Reba\u2019s Conditional Settlement Is Stronger Than Four\u2019s Resignation  \n     \u2022 Reba voices \u201cterrible mistake\u201d only regarding Four\u2019s youth, not colonization itself: she never laments her own exile\u2014she never offers to sacrifice her family. She works with others to settle. Four\u2019s approach is solitary, end\u2010state death if rescue fails.\n\n5. Addressing \u201cConditional Hope\u201d for Rescue  \n   \u2022 All characters retain initial hope. But only Reba transitions to practical settlement when \u201cshort of a miracle.\u201d Four never transitions fully\u2014continues puzzle.  \n   \u2022 Favoring staying means rational acceptance and adaptation, not perpetual attempt to overturn one\u2019s condition. Reba\u2019s \u201cbest of what we\u2019ve got\u201d and willingness to invoke \u201call the babies we want\u201d prove longer\u2010term vision.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Reba: active colony planner, community builder, resource applier, wholly embraces permanent stay when rescue impractical.  \n   \u2022 Four: self\u2010centered child\u2019s martyr, obsessed with escape logic, offers solitude, not community, no children, no resource development.  \n   Therefore, Reba is undeniably \u201cmost in favor of staying.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Four over Reba as \u201cMost in Favor of Staying\u201d\n\n1. \u201cIn Favor\u201d Means Willing Permanently to Abandon Return  \n   1.1 Reba\u2019s \u201csettlement\u201d is conditional on rescue \u201cin a few centuries.\u201d  \n      \u2022 She insists on setting \u201cthe transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u201d (quote \u201cWhich might get picked up in a few centuries,\u201d Ch.27), betraying her continued hope and preference for return. A true \u201cfavor\u201d to stay requires absolute relinquishment of that hope.  \n   1.2 Reba cites the one-child law and warns Joyce she could be \u201ccondemn[ed] \u2026 to exile from civilization\u201d (Ch.27), indicating she fears and resents permanent exile, not embraces it.  \n   1.3 She repeatedly complains of \u201cexile\u201d (\u201cthe end of our search,\u201d Ch.27) and calls Four\u2019s presence a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d (Ch.9), showing distaste for the planet itself.\n\n2. Four\u2019s Voluntary Martyrdom Is Strongest Evidence of Permanent Preference  \n   2.1 Four offers himself as sole permanent colonist: \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u201d to stay with Fweep alone (Ch.31). He explicitly values remaining when departure for others is possible.  \n   2.2 He never resumes calls for the polarizer\u2019s repair or distress signals for himself; he works puzzles only to free others, not to free himself (Ch.35: \u201cIf you can state the problem \u2026 All you want \u2026 then is decimal points\u201d).  \n   2.3 Despite youth and conditional acceptance by elders, Four persistently studies Fweepland gravity (\u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026 trying to locate its center of gravity,\u201d Ch.31) rather than pining for home, demonstrating genuine interest in habitat mastery.\n\n3. Emotional Bond with Fweep Contradicts Desire to Leave  \n   3.1 Four\u2019s affectionate term \u201cFwiend\u201d (Ch.31) and care for Fweep\u2019s loneliness (\u201che\u2019s never had any friends\u201d) show he places companionship above returning to Earth.  \n   3.2 All invasive or destructive measures (\"rat poison,\u201d \u201cenriched uranium,\u201d Ch.32) are rejected by Four as risking his friend\u2019s life; he seeks coexistence, not escape that abandons Fweep.  \n   3.3 He refrains from \u201cviolence \u2026 might be more dangerous to us than to him\u201d (Ch.32), preferring persistence in place rather than sacrificing the planet\u2019s only sentient denizen.\n\n4. Intellectual Engagement with Planet Implies Preference to Thrive Here  \n   4.1 Four tackles logical puzzles (\u201cNiccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle,\u201d Ch.16) and \u201cpircuit\u201d building, mastering local \u201clogic\u201d of Fweep\u2019s circular polarization. This mirrors colonial science and suggests long-term research interest.  \n   4.2 He welcomes Grampa\u2019s challenge to build pircuit variations (Ch.17), showing active engagement with puzzles and instruments, not resignation.\n\n5. Reba\u2019s \u201cPragmatism\u201d Is Passive Resignation, Not Preference  \n   5.1 She \u201cadmits\u201d they are \u201cinvoluntary colonists\u201d \u201cshort of a miracle\u201d (Ch.27). Involuntary colonists resent exile; only Four volunteers colonization.  \n   5.2 Her continued alliance with Joyce\u2019s laws and \u201ccivilization\u201d (Ch.27: \u201cYou can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not me\u201d) contrasts with Four\u2019s break from Earth society.  \n   5.3 Reba\u2019s affinity with Grampa\u2019s pre-Fweep polarizer obsession (Ch.15) shows initial overcoming only when forced; she never actively proposes plee to Fweep or research his gravity beyond maintaining resource flow.\n\n6. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Points  \n   6.1 \u201cColony-Building vs. Martyrdom\u201d  \n      \u2022 True colonization is not mass transport but permanency. Four\u2019s willingness to sacrifice return marks strongest favor. Reba\u2019s proposal \u201cfor the best of what we\u2019ve got\u201d only under duress.  \n   6.2 \u201cChild vs. Leadership\u201d  \n      \u2022 Four demonstrates leadership: he solves puzzles, measures gravity, cares for Fweep. Reba defers to Junior\u2019s puzzles and distress calls.  \n   6.3 \u201cObsession with Rescue\u201d  \n      \u2022 The only \u201crescue\u201d Four seeks is conceptual for others; never himself. Reba actively hopes for rescue and fears exile.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly Four repeatedly refuses all plans that would restore him, offers self-exile to remain alone with Fweep, devotes intellect to mastering and co-existing on Fweepland, and never telegraphs desire for rescue. Reba\u2019s \u201csettlement\u201d is qualified, hope-laden, resentful, and dependent on rescue. Therefore, Four is indisputably the one most in favor of staying.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
