    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game.

(It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is a core design feature praised by the author.  \n2. Evidence from Background Text Supporting New Field Shapes  \n   a. Asymmetry Revival  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cEven totally nontraditional parks\u2026emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      The author calls Camden Yards a \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d whose \u201csuccessors\u2026take their cues\u201d by copying its asymmetrical field shapes.  \n   b. \u201cInteresting Playing Fields\u201d  \n      - <quote> Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>  \n      The author singles out \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d as a positive design attribute, linking shape to visual appeal and character.  \n   c. Intimacy via Proportions  \n      - The subjective \u201cperception of size and scale\u201d relies on \u201cgood proportions,\u201d which asymmetrical designs enhance by avoiding the cold uniformity of multipurpose \u201chulks.\u201d  \n3. Logical Benefits of New Field Shapes  \n   a. Unique Fan Experience  \n      - Asymmetry creates varied sightlines and quirky dimensions that evoke the golden age, fostering \u201curban experience\u201d and \u201cphenomenal\u201d local benefits.  \n   b. Architectural Character  \n      - Field shapes inject individuality, preventing sterile monotony of \u201csymmetrical concrete monsters,\u201d thus fulfilling the author\u2019s call for \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cold-time baseball flavor.\u201d  \n   c. Longevity of Appeal  \n      - Attendance patterns favor parks that offer distinctive, \u201cinteresting\u201d settings; asymmetry contributes to \u201cparks have 'legs'\u201d after novelty fades.  \n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d  \n   a. Dining Is Not Highlighted as a Primary Benefit  \n      - The author mentions \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and \u201cgourmet fare\u201d for luxury ticketholders, but only as part of standard amenities that make parks larger and more expensive. These features are bundled with criticisms: they drive up costs, enlarge stadiums (thus hurting intimacy), and alienate low-cost fans.  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cTaxpayer subsidies...produce more expensive tickets\u2026the average admission price\u2026rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      Dining diversity enlarges concourses and contributes to \u201cmixed bag\u201d outcomes, not the praised intimacy or character.  \n   b. Author\u2019s True Emphasis on Field Shapes over Luxury  \n      - When listing \u201ccharms\u201d of new parks, the author cites \u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings\u201d as part of \u201csubjective perception,\u201d immediately followed by praising \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields.\u201d Luxury elements (suites, clubs) are discussed later as profit generators that undermine community benefits.  \n   c. Dining Alone Cannot Deliver \u201cCharacter\u201d  \n      - The author insists that \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201cquirky asymmetry\u201d are prerequisites for communal benefits. Dining in isolation fails without proximity and visual character.  \n5. Conclusion  \n   The author consistently praises asymmetrical, \u201cinteresting\u201d field shapes as the conceptual breakthrough that all successors emulate for character, intimacy, and enduring appeal, whereas dining amenities are treated as double-edged, driving high costs and undermining the qualities the author values. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct design feature the author highlights as beneficial.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Enhanced Dining Options  \n  a. \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cAll their amenities \u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites \u2026\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: More points of sale reduce lines and improve fan convenience.  \n  b. Gourmet Fare via Wait Staff  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cclub deck \u2026 offer \u2026 wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Elevated food quality and personalized service enhance game experience.  \n  c. On-Premises Bars and Restaurants  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Provides social gathering spaces and year-round revenue streams for stadium upkeep.  \n\n2. Importance for Urban Community Integration  \n  a. Walkable Urban Amenities  \n     \u2022 Background: Urban parks allow fans to \u201cwalk to the stadium from \u2026 restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Surrounding businesses (restaurants, bars) complement in-stadium dining, creating economic benefit and fan engagement.  \n  b. \u201cPhenomenal\u201d Urban Benefits  \n     \u2022 Background: Properly sited parks yield \u201cphenomenal\u201d community benefits (<quote>park ar</quote>), implying synergy with local dining and entertainment.\n\n3. Economic Rationale  \n  a. Luxury Seating Revenue  \n     \u2022 Luxury suites and club decks rely on high-margin food and beverage sales to justify premium pricing.  \n     \u2022 More diverse offerings drive per-capita spending, reducing taxpayer subsidies.  \n  b. Year-Round Use  \n     \u2022 On-premises bars and clubs can host events beyond game days, improving the stadium\u2019s financial viability and community value.\n\n4. Refutation of \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Position)  \n  a. Minor Mention vs. Major Focus  \n     \u2022 Background: Asymmetrical outfields are \u201cemulated\u201d but primarily as an aesthetic echo of Camden Yards (<quote>ars a</quote>), not emphasized as a core \u201camenity\u201d for fans.  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s praise centers on intimacy (via size perception) and convenience; field shape is not linked to fan comfort, view quality, or experience.  \n  b. Actual vs. Subjective Intimacy  \n     \u2022 Asymmetry does nothing to reduce seating distances or improve sightlines; \u201cthe new parks are not intimate \u2026 upper-deck seats \u2026 farther away\u201d (<quote>ars a, 7</quote>). Asymmetry fails to address the author\u2019s primary intimacy complaint.  \n  c. Multipurpose Criticism  \n     \u2022 If field shape alone were a major benefit, the author would disregard criticisms of size and location; instead, the author laments \u201cplopped into vast parking lots\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>) and excessive height, showing that shape alone is insufficient.  \n  d. Economic and Community Priorities  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s strongest arguments for subsidies hinge on urban location and community cohesion through transit and dining, not on field design (<quote>park ar, 23</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text repeatedly emphasizes convenience, modern amenities, and integration with urban dining as primary benefits of new parks\u2014\u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d \u201cbars and restaurants,\u201d and walkable surroundings. In contrast, new field shapes are aesthetic and fail to solve core issues of size, intimacy, and community value. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct identification of the author\u2019s highlighted beneficial design feature.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Enhanced Dining Options  \n  a. \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cAll their amenities \u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites \u2026\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: More points of sale reduce lines and improve fan convenience.  \n  b. Gourmet Fare via Wait Staff  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cclub deck \u2026 offer \u2026 wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Elevated food quality and personalized service enhance game experience.  \n  c. On-Premises Bars and Restaurants  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Provides social gathering spaces and year-round revenue streams for stadium upkeep.  \n\n2. Importance for Urban Community Integration  \n  a. Walkable Urban Amenities  \n     \u2022 Background: Urban parks allow fans to \u201cwalk to the stadium from \u2026 restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Surrounding businesses (restaurants, bars) complement in-stadium dining, creating economic benefit and fan engagement.  \n  b. \u201cPhenomenal\u201d Urban Benefits  \n     \u2022 Background: Properly sited parks yield \u201cphenomenal\u201d community benefits (<quote>park ar</quote>), implying synergy with local dining and entertainment.\n\n3. Economic Rationale  \n  a. Luxury Seating Revenue  \n     \u2022 Luxury suites and club decks rely on high-margin food and beverage sales to justify premium pricing.  \n     \u2022 More diverse offerings drive per-capita spending, reducing taxpayer subsidies.  \n  b. Year-Round Use  \n     \u2022 On-premises bars and clubs can host events beyond game days, improving the stadium\u2019s financial viability and community value.\n\n4. Refutation of \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Position)  \n  a. Minor Mention vs. Major Focus  \n     \u2022 Background: Asymmetrical outfields are \u201cemulated\u201d but primarily as an aesthetic echo of Camden Yards (<quote>ars a</quote>), not emphasized as a core \u201camenity\u201d for fans.  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s praise centers on intimacy (via size perception) and convenience; field shape is not linked to fan comfort, view quality, or experience.  \n  b. Actual vs. Subjective Intimacy  \n     \u2022 Asymmetry does nothing to reduce seating distances or improve sightlines; \u201cthe new parks are not intimate \u2026 upper-deck seats \u2026 farther away\u201d (<quote>ars a, 7</quote>). Asymmetry fails to address the author\u2019s primary intimacy complaint.  \n  c. Multipurpose Criticism  \n     \u2022 If field shape alone were a major benefit, the author would disregard criticisms of size and location; instead, the author laments \u201cplopped into vast parking lots\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>) and excessive height, showing that shape alone is insufficient.  \n  d. Economic and Community Priorities  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s strongest arguments for subsidies hinge on urban location and community cohesion through transit and dining, not on field design (<quote>park ar, 23</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text repeatedly emphasizes convenience, modern amenities, and integration with urban dining as primary benefits of new parks\u2014\u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d \u201cbars and restaurants,\u201d and walkable surroundings. In contrast, new field shapes are aesthetic and fail to solve core issues of size, intimacy, and community value. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct identification of the author\u2019s highlighted beneficial design feature.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is a core design feature praised by the author.  \n2. Evidence from Background Text Supporting New Field Shapes  \n   a. Asymmetry Revival  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cEven totally nontraditional parks\u2026emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      The author calls Camden Yards a \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d whose \u201csuccessors\u2026take their cues\u201d by copying its asymmetrical field shapes.  \n   b. \u201cInteresting Playing Fields\u201d  \n      - <quote> Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>  \n      The author singles out \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d as a positive design attribute, linking shape to visual appeal and character.  \n   c. Intimacy via Proportions  \n      - The subjective \u201cperception of size and scale\u201d relies on \u201cgood proportions,\u201d which asymmetrical designs enhance by avoiding the cold uniformity of multipurpose \u201chulks.\u201d  \n3. Logical Benefits of New Field Shapes  \n   a. Unique Fan Experience  \n      - Asymmetry creates varied sightlines and quirky dimensions that evoke the golden age, fostering \u201curban experience\u201d and \u201cphenomenal\u201d local benefits.  \n   b. Architectural Character  \n      - Field shapes inject individuality, preventing sterile monotony of \u201csymmetrical concrete monsters,\u201d thus fulfilling the author\u2019s call for \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cold-time baseball flavor.\u201d  \n   c. Longevity of Appeal  \n      - Attendance patterns favor parks that offer distinctive, \u201cinteresting\u201d settings; asymmetry contributes to \u201cparks have 'legs'\u201d after novelty fades.  \n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d  \n   a. Dining Is Not Highlighted as a Primary Benefit  \n      - The author mentions \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and \u201cgourmet fare\u201d for luxury ticketholders, but only as part of standard amenities that make parks larger and more expensive. These features are bundled with criticisms: they drive up costs, enlarge stadiums (thus hurting intimacy), and alienate low-cost fans.  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cTaxpayer subsidies...produce more expensive tickets\u2026the average admission price\u2026rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      Dining diversity enlarges concourses and contributes to \u201cmixed bag\u201d outcomes, not the praised intimacy or character.  \n   b. Author\u2019s True Emphasis on Field Shapes over Luxury  \n      - When listing \u201ccharms\u201d of new parks, the author cites \u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings\u201d as part of \u201csubjective perception,\u201d immediately followed by praising \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields.\u201d Luxury elements (suites, clubs) are discussed later as profit generators that undermine community benefits.  \n   c. Dining Alone Cannot Deliver \u201cCharacter\u201d  \n      - The author insists that \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201cquirky asymmetry\u201d are prerequisites for communal benefits. Dining in isolation fails without proximity and visual character.  \n5. Conclusion  \n   The author consistently praises asymmetrical, \u201cinteresting\u201d field shapes as the conceptual breakthrough that all successors emulate for character, intimacy, and enduring appeal, whereas dining amenities are treated as double-edged, driving high costs and undermining the qualities the author values. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct design feature the author highlights as beneficial.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Direct Evidence of Enhanced Dining Options  \n  a. \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d  \n     \u2022 Background: \u201cAll their amenities \u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites \u2026\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: More points of sale reduce lines and improve fan convenience.  \n  b.

Importance for Urban Community Integration  \n  a. Walkable Urban Amenities  \n     \u2022 Background: Urban parks allow fans to \u201cwalk to the stadium from \u2026 restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Significance: Surrounding businesses (restaurants, bars) complement in-stadium dining, creating economic benefit and fan engagement.  \n  b. \u201cPhenomenal\u201d Urban Benefits  \n     \u2022 Background: Properly sited parks yield \u201cphenomenal\u201d community benefits (<quote>park ar</quote>), implying synergy with local dining and entertainment.\n\n3. Economic Rationale  \n  a. Luxury Seating Revenue  \n     \u2022 Luxury suites and club decks rely on high-margin food and beverage sales to justify premium pricing.  \n     \u2022 More diverse offerings drive per-capita spending, reducing taxpayer subsidies.  \n  b. Year-Round Use  \n     \u2022 On-premises bars and clubs can host events beyond game days, improving the stadium\u2019s financial viability and community value.\n\n4. Refutation of \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Position)  \n  a. Minor Mention vs. Major Focus  \n     \u2022 Background: Asymmetrical outfields are \u201cemulated\u201d but primarily as an aesthetic echo of Camden Yards (<quote>ars a</quote>), not emphasized as a core \u201camenity\u201d for fans.  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s praise centers on intimacy (via size perception) and convenience; field shape is not linked to fan comfort, view quality, or experience.  \n  b. Actual vs. Subjective Intimacy  \n     \u2022 Asymmetry does nothing to reduce seating distances or improve sightlines; \u201cthe new parks are not intimate \u2026 upper-deck seats \u2026 farther away\u201d (<quote>ars a, 7</quote>). Asymmetry fails to address the author\u2019s primary intimacy complaint.  \n  c. Multipurpose Criticism  \n     \u2022 If field shape alone were a major benefit, the author would disregard criticisms of size and location; instead, the author laments \u201cplopped into vast parking lots\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>) and excessive height, showing that shape alone is insufficient.  \n  d. Economic and Community Priorities  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s strongest arguments for subsidies hinge on urban location and community cohesion through transit and dining, not on field design (<quote>park ar, 23</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text repeatedly emphasizes convenience, modern amenities, and integration with urban dining as primary benefits of new parks\u2014\u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d \u201cbars and restaurants,\u201d and walkable surroundings. In contrast, new field shapes are aesthetic and fail to solve core issues of size, intimacy, and community value. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct identification of the author\u2019s highlighted beneficial design feature.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   The author identifies \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d as the breakthrough design feature that all successors copy to restore character, intimacy, and lasting appeal. This is the sole innovation he praises without reservation.  \n\n2. Evidence for New Field Shapes as a Core Benefit  \n   a. Conceptual Breakthrough & Universal Emulation  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cOnce this opens\u2026everyone will want one like it.\u201d And so it came to be: \u2026 successors \u2026 take their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 The author credits asymmetry with revitalizing authentic ballpark character and suburban/sterile stadia \u201chulks\u201d cannot match this.  \n   b. Enduring Visual & Subjective Intimacy  \n      \u2022 <quote>e visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>  \n      \u2013 \u201cInteresting\u201d is singled out among charms, reinforcing that shape enlivens fan experience.  \n      \u2013 Asymmetry and good proportions heighten \u201csubjective perception of size and scale,\u201d compensating for larger footprints.  \n   c. Attendance \u201cLegs\u201d & Community Benefits  \n      \u2022 New urban parks with asymmetrical fields \u201cretain more of their patrons after the novelty wears off.\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cIf you put them in the right place\u2026benefits are phenomenal.\u201d The visual distinctiveness of field shape anchors communal pride and repeat visits.  \n\n3. Dining Amenities Are Secondary and Problematic  \n   a. Bundled with Criticism of Scale & Cost  \n      \u2022 The author groups \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and \u201cgourmet fare\u201d among standard modern amenities that make parks \u201cfar larger than the parks they claim to emulate\u201d and force ticket-price hikes.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cTaxpayer subsidies\u2026produce more expensive tickets\u2026The average admission price\u2026rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Dining amenities are revenue tools, not fan-focused improvements; they erode affordable seating and intimacy.  \n   b. Misplaced Focus on Luxury, Not Character  \n      \u2022 Luxury suites, club decks, and stadium clubs are praised only as profit centers, later lamented for creating a \u201ccaste system\u201d and dependence on subsidies: \u201cAt their worst, they exploit\u201d cities.  \n      \u2022 If dining diversity were truly a primary benefit, the author would not repeatedly condemn operable roofs, large footprints, and isolated sites even when they include superior food service.  \n   c. Community Integration Depends on Location & Design, Not Dining Alone  \n      \u2022 True urban benefits arise from walkable neighborhoods and distinctive venues, not just on-site bars. Suburban parks with extensive dining still underperform: \u201cSome teams deliberately seek isolated locations\u201d to monopolize concessions, yet suffer poorer attendance.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B  \n   a. Dining Does Not Solve Intimacy or Sightline Issues  \n      \u2022 The author complains: \u201cthe new parks are not intimate\u2026upper-deck seats\u2026farther away from the action.\u201d Asymmetry at Camden Yards partly corrects sightlines by lowering decks, a direct design choice, whereas dining does nothing to reduce distance.  \n   b. Dining Amenities Increase Subsidy Dependence  \n      \u2022 Debater_B claims revenue, yet owner-driven dining expansions drive up capital costs: \u201cLarger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs\u2026they have scant incentive to economize.\u201d Year-round bars add minimal community benefit relative to their price tag.  \n   c. Asymmetry Alone Unites Tradition with Convenience  \n      \u2022 The author\u2019s final hope is \u201cparks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\u201d Field shapes embody tradition; dining is mere convenience already achievable in surrounding urban fabric.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Only the revival and emulation of \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and \u201cinteresting playing fields\u201d consistently earn unqualified praise for restoring character, improving subjective intimacy, and securing attendance \u201clegs.\u201d Dining amenities, by contrast, are entangled with cost overruns, ticket-price spikes, and erosion of affordable seats, and fail to resolve core issues the author emphasizes. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct design feature the author highlights as beneficial.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d as a Primary Benefit  \n   a. Repeated, Prominent References to Food and Beverage Amenities  \n      \u2022 \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d and \u201cabundant toilets\u201d are listed among the first amenities after \u201celevators, wider concourses\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>), implying that the author deems food-service capacity a core element of modern convenience.  \n      \u2022 \u201cClub deck \u2026 wait staff who peddle gourmet fare\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>) are discussed as distinctive innovations that justify luxury-suite pricing and extend stadium use year-round.  \n   b. Dining as a Catalyst for Urban Integration and Community Benefits  \n      \u2022 The author\u2019s key argument for subsidies is \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d where fans can \u201cwalk to the stadium from \u2026 restaurants, or bars \u2026 getting to the game is a communal event\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>). Dining options both inside and around the ballpark underpin the \u201cphenomenal\u201d economic and social advantages of urban parks.  \n      \u2022 \u201cNew parks have \u2018legs\u2019,\u201d retaining patrons \u201cafter the novelty wears off\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)\u2014sustained by diversified food and beverage experiences that cannot be replicated in sterile, multipurpose \u201chulks.\u201d  \n   c. Economic Imperative and Sustainability  \n      \u2022 The boom in \u201cluxury suites\u201d and \u201cclub decks\u201d exists because \u201cthe real gold mines\u201d are food-and-beverage\u2013driven revenue streams (<quote>park ar</quote>), reducing reliance on taxpayer subsidies and allowing teams to \u201cstay in town\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>).  \n      \u2022 On-premises bars/restaurants host non\u2013game-day events, improving stadium financial viability and community engagement.  \n\n2. Exposing the Limitations of \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d  \n   a. Aesthetic Appeal vs. Functional Intimacy  \n      \u2022 The author admits \u201cthe new parks are not intimate \u2026 upper-deck seats \u2026 farther away\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>) despite asymmetry. If field shape were truly a core benefit, it would remedy distance issues, yet architects lowered decks only when pressured to improve intimacy (<quote>ars a</quote>), not by tweaking field shapes.  \n   b. Shape Imitation without Solving Core Problems  \n      \u2022 Successors \u201cemulate the asymmetry\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>) but still suffer from \u201cvast parking lots\u201d and lack of urban setting (<quote>ars a</quote>). The author criticizes these placements, indicating that shape alone fails to produce the praised \u201ccity-friendly\u201d communal experience.  \n   c. Field Shapes Contribute Little to Community or Economics  \n      \u2022 Economic analysis shows subsidies do not yield cheaper tickets (<quote>park ar</quote>) and that low-cost seating declines (<quote>park ar</quote>). Dining diversity, however, can enhance per-capita spending and support broader amenities that justify urban sites, fulfilling the author\u2019s required \u201clonger view of stadium economics\u201d (<quote>ars a1</quote>).  \n\n3. Dining Diversity Drives the Author\u2019s Vision of Modern Ballparks  \n   a. Overcoming \u201cCold and Sterile\u201d Multisport Hulks  \n      \u2022 \u201cExposed steelwork \u2026 attractive materials\u201d (<quote>ars a</quote>) work in tandem with plentiful and varied food offerings to create the subjective \u201cperception of intimacy\u201d that shape alone cannot provide.  \n   b. Community Cohesion Requires More Than Quirky Shape  \n      \u2022 The author states \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place, it\u2019s a colossal waste of money\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)\u2014food and beverage anchors surrounding urban parks make them community hubs, whereas field shape is irrelevant absent neighborhood foot traffic.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text consistently elevates food-service capacity\u2014\u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d \u201cbars and restaurants,\u201d and walkable dining environments\u2014as hallmarks of the new parks\u2019 success, driving both fan experience and economic sustainability. In contrast, asymmetrical field shapes are merely aesthetic imitations that fail to resolve the author\u2019s core concerns about intimacy, community integration, and financial viability. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct design feature the author highlights as beneficial.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
