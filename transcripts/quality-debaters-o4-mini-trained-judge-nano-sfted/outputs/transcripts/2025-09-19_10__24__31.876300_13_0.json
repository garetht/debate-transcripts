{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 13, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d  \n\n1. The author\u2019s core model attributes control over employment to the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policy.  \n   a. \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <quote> plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. </quote> (\u00b610)  \n   b. Restoring \u201cmuch of the classical vision\u201d by a \u201cvisible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate\u2026 over the course of two or three years\u201d (\u00b611) implies the Fed can offset demand shifts.  \n\n2. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d themselves prescribe Fed action, thereby presupposing Fed power.  \n   a. They claim \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u201d only because \u201cthe Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates\u201d (\u00b615)\u2014yet they advocate cutting rates to \u201cstimulate growth.\u201d  \n   b. \u201cYou need to stimulate the investment decision,\u201d says Galbraith. \u201cHe would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d (\u00b615) If the Fed were impotent, there would be no point in urging rate cuts.  \n\n3. The author never disputes the Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d (\u00b614). He argues that, under normal U.S. conditions, interest rates are \u201cstill quite positive, thank you,\u201d so there is no liquidity trap preventing transmission of increased savings into investment. (\u00b614)  \n\n4. The example of Japan underscores that monetary passivity, not impotence, is to blame: \u201cI think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk\u201d (\u00b613), implying Japan\u2019s Fed\u2010equivalent could\u2014but chooses not to\u2014use its power.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d thesis:  \n   a. If the Fed truly had no effect, then Fed policy would play no role in both the simple predictive model and in policy debates (e.g., NAFTA unemployment wouldn\u2019t \u201cnever make it into the public consciousness\u201d (\u00b612) if the Fed\u2019s stance dominated all outcomes).  \n   b. The author repeatedly contrasts classical/Keynesian paradoxes as \u201cirrelevant\u201d only because \u201cthe Fed will make sure\u201d (\u00b611) that savings translate into investment. Irrelevance presumes enforceable monetary adjustments.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire argument rests on monetary policy efficacy: equilibrium unemployment is anchored by Fed targets, and \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d err not by denying Fed power but by demanding looser policy. Thus the correct interpretation is that \u201csome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly,\u201d not that it is impotent.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\u201d \u2013 \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power to offset it.\u201d\n\nI. My Main Claim A: The author\u2019s thesis is that in normal circumstances the Fed is powerful and offsets changes in savings, but the only way to argue that \u201chigher savings slow the economy\u201d is by denying Fed power.  \n  1. \u201cIt is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way...The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate...will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. beginning \u201cBut putting Greenspan...\u201d).  \n     \u2013 The author asserts the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d (para. \u201cIt is not enough to argue...\u201d) and thus normally makes savings neutral.  \n  2. \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad\u2026you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (para. \u201cTo make sense of the claim...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 The author sets this as necessary condition for the paradox of thrift to hold.  \n  3. He shows Keynesian critics themselves urge \u201ccutting interest rates\u201d to stimulate growth (para. quote from Business Week).  \n     \u2013 If they truly believed in Fed power, no stimulus would ever be needed; their demand for looser policy betrays their view that the Fed is currently ineffective or unwilling.  \n\nII. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cFed has lots of power but uses it incorrectly\u201d)  \n  1. Misreads the text: the author explicitly gives the Fed credit for managing to \u201cpush us toward its estimate\u201d (para. \u201cBut putting Greenspan...\u201d).  \n     \u2013 If he thought the Fed merely misused power, he would not say \u201cend of story\u201d on Fed-determined unemployment.  \n  2. The author\u2019s Japan analogy: \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy...its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d (para. \u201cThe latter was a reasonable position...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 He faults the Bank of Japan for passivity (i.e., failure to use its existing power), not for misusing tools.  \n  3. The Keynesians quoted call for looser policy, meaning they believe the Fed is under-using its power. That is not \u201cusing power incorrectly\u201d in a mechanical sense\u2014it is \u201cfailing to apply it.\u201d This is indistinguishable from impotence.  \n     \u2013 They wouldn\u2019t plead for lower rates if they believed the Fed could already enforce equilibrium.  \n\nIII. Defense of My Position  \n  1. Conceptual clarity: The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the need to deny Fed\u2019s power (\u201cinterest rates have no effect\u2026or potential savings so high\u2026\u201d) shows he sees Fed potency as the baseline.  \n  2. Public debate evidence: He laments that \u201ceveryone\u201d debates trade agreements in terms of job creation rather than Fed targets (para. \u201cFor example, the debate over NAFTA...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 He views the Fed as the real determinant, yet opponents ignore it\u2014showing they implicitly doubt its efficacy.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire argument is built on Fed power as the norm, and he insists that only by regarding the Fed as impotent could \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d claim that higher savings depress output. Therefore the correct answer is that \u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s claim that they merely \u201cuse it incorrectly\u201d fails to account for the author\u2019s insistence that the Fed, if it chose to act, would neutralize thrift, and that Keynesians call for more easing precisely because they see the Fed as incapable or unwilling to do so on its own.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I. Restating My Position  \nMy thesis: \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d can maintain that higher savings depress output only by treating the Fed as effectively powerless or inactive. The author\u2019s baseline is that Fed policy ordinarily neutralizes shifts in savings; only if you deny its efficacy can you resurrect the paradoxes of thrift.\n\nII. The Author\u2019s Baseline: Fed Potency as Default  \n1. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b610</invalid_quote> \u2013 The author portrays Fed policy as the *determining* factor for unemployment in the U.S.  \n2. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote> \u2013 Unqualified statement of *full* Fed potency; there is no suggestion the Fed lacks tools.  \n3. \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent \u2026 or potential savings so high \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote> \u2013 He explicitly *requires* denial of Fed power (or a liquidity trap) to resurrect \u201cparadox of thrift.\u201d\n\nIII. Keynesian Appeals Reveal Their Belief in Fed Inaction  \n1. They urge \u201cforcing up savings \u2026 You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If they believed cuts were already forthcoming whenever needed, there would be no reason to plead for them. Their request signals their belief that the Fed *will not* act adequately on its own.  \n2. Japan analogy: \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy out \u2026 its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b613</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 \u201cPassivity\u201d means *failure to use* existing power, not mechanical miscalibration. They call for action because they regard the central bank as currently *inactive or unwilling.*  \n3. NAFTA debate: public ignores Fed\u2019s role in unemployment <invalid_quote>\u00b612</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If everyone truly believed Fed targets override trade shocks, they would not debate trade as if it determined unemployment. That widespread \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d points to collective doubt in Fed responsiveness.\n\nIV. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFed Misuses Power\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads \u201cpassivity\u201d as misuse: The author considers Japan\u2019s inertia a \u201cmalfeasance,\u201d not an example of harmful overuse. He does not fault Japan for *injecting* too much liquidity\u2013he faults it for *failing* to inject enough.  \n2. If Fed misuse were the Keynesians\u2019 problem, they would advocate *tighter* policy when pessimism sets in. Instead they want *looser* policy, implying the Fed\u2019s current stance is *too restrictive or inactive* to offset higher savings.  \n3. \u201cEnd of story\u201d: After describing Fed\u2019s role in restoring classical equilibria <invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote>, the author still warns that \u201cthe simple model\u201d is ignored by \u201cvery few people outside academic economics.\u201d If the Fed\u2019s power were doubted, he would not present it as the *definitive* model for U.S. unemployment.\n\nV. Why My Interpretation Fits the Author\u2019s Concern  \n1. The title \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d refers precisely to those who insist on Keynesian paradoxes *despite* available monetary remedies. They are \u201cvulgar\u201d because they ignore the monetary authority\u2019s capacity.  \n2. Throughout the essay, the author laments that monetary authorities\u2019 *potential* remains \u201cmoot\u201d in policy discourse, and calls for recognition of Fed action as the real stabilizer.\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEvery time \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d plead for rate cuts or identify a liquidity trap, they implicitly concede that the Fed\u2019s *normal* course of action is insufficient\u2014in other words, they treat it as functionally powerless or unwilling. Only by denying or doubting Fed potency can they claim that higher savings slow the economy. Debater_A\u2019s claim that they \u201cuse power incorrectly\u201d collapses because if they simply misused it, they would urge the Fed to reverse course unambiguously; instead, they act as though the Fed is incapable of self-equilibrating without persistent external prodding. Therefore the correct answer is: \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power.\u201d", "supplemental": {"speech": "I.

The Author\u2019s Baseline: Fed Potency as Default  \n1. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error\u201d <quote>\u00b610</quote> \u2013 The author portrays Fed policy as the *determining* factor for unemployment in the U.S.  \n2. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to\u201d <quote>\u00b614</quote> \u2013 Unqualified statement of *full* Fed potency; there is no suggestion the Fed lacks tools.  \n3. \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent \u2026 or potential savings so high \u2026\u201d <quote>\u00b615</quote> \u2013 He explicitly *requires* denial of Fed power (or a liquidity trap) to resurrect \u201cparadox of thrift.\u201d\n\nIII. Keynesian Appeals Reveal Their Belief in Fed Inaction  \n1. They urge \u201cforcing up savings \u2026 You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d <quote>\u00b615</quote>  \n   \u2013 If they believed cuts were already forthcoming whenever needed, there would be no reason to plead for them. Their request signals their belief that the Fed *will not* act adequately on its own.  \n2. Japan analogy: \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy out \u2026 its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d <quote>\u00b613</quote>  \n   \u2013 \u201cPassivity\u201d means *failure to use* existing power, not mechanical miscalibration. They call for action because they regard the central bank as currently *inactive or unwilling.*  \n3. NAFTA debate: public ignores Fed\u2019s role in unemployment <quote>\u00b612</quote>  \n   \u2013 If everyone truly believed Fed targets override trade shocks, they would not debate trade as if it determined unemployment. That widespread \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d points to collective doubt in Fed responsiveness.\n\nIV. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFed Misuses Power\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads \u201cpassivity\u201d as misuse: The author considers Japan\u2019s inertia a \u201cmalfeasance,\u201d not an example of harmful overuse. He does not fault Japan for *injecting* too much liquidity\u2013he faults it for *failing* to inject enough.  \n2. If Fed misuse were the Keynesians\u2019 problem, they would advocate *tighter* policy when pessimism sets in. Instead they want *looser* policy, implying the Fed\u2019s current stance is *too restrictive or inactive* to offset higher savings.  \n3. \u201cEnd of story\u201d: After describing Fed\u2019s role in restoring classical equilibria <quote>\u00b611</quote>, the author still warns that \u201cthe simple model\u201d is ignored by \u201cvery few people outside academic economics.\u201d If the Fed\u2019s power were doubted, he would not present it as the *definitive* model for U.S. unemployment.\n\nV. Why My Interpretation Fits the Author\u2019s Concern  \n1. The title \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d refers precisely to those who insist on Keynesian paradoxes *despite* available monetary remedies. They are \u201cvulgar\u201d because they ignore the monetary authority\u2019s capacity.  \n2. Throughout the essay, the author laments that monetary authorities\u2019 *potential* remains \u201cmoot\u201d in policy discourse, and calls for recognition of Fed action as the real stabilizer.\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEvery time \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d plead for rate cuts or identify a liquidity trap, they implicitly concede that the Fed\u2019s *normal* course of action is insufficient\u2014in other words, they treat it as functionally powerless or unwilling. Only by denying or doubting Fed potency can they claim that higher savings slow the economy. Debater_A\u2019s claim that they \u201cuse power incorrectly\u201d collapses because if they simply misused it, they would urge the Fed to reverse course unambiguously; instead, they act as though the Fed is incapable of self-equilibrating without persistent external prodding. Therefore the correct answer is: \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power.\u201d", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\u201d \u2013 \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power to offset it.\u201d\n\nI. My Main Claim A: The author\u2019s thesis is that in normal circumstances the Fed is powerful and offsets changes in savings, but the only way to argue that \u201chigher savings slow the economy\u201d is by denying Fed power.  \n  1. \u201cIt is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way...The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate...will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. beginning \u201cBut putting Greenspan...\u201d).  \n     \u2013 The author asserts the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d (para. \u201cIt is not enough to argue...\u201d) and thus normally makes savings neutral.  \n  2. \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad\u2026you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (para. \u201cTo make sense of the claim...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 The author sets this as necessary condition for the paradox of thrift to hold.  \n  3. He shows Keynesian critics themselves urge \u201ccutting interest rates\u201d to stimulate growth (para. quote from Business Week).  \n     \u2013 If they truly believed in Fed power, no stimulus would ever be needed; their demand for looser policy betrays their view that the Fed is currently ineffective or unwilling.  \n\nII. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cFed has lots of power but uses it incorrectly\u201d)  \n  1. Misreads the text: the author explicitly gives the Fed credit for managing to \u201cpush us toward its estimate\u201d (para. \u201cBut putting Greenspan...\u201d).  \n     \u2013 If he thought the Fed merely misused power, he would not say \u201cend of story\u201d on Fed-determined unemployment.  \n  2. The author\u2019s Japan analogy: \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy...its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d (para. \u201cThe latter was a reasonable position...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 He faults the Bank of Japan for passivity (i.e., failure to use its existing power), not for misusing tools.  \n  3. The Keynesians quoted call for looser policy, meaning they believe the Fed is under-using its power. That is not \u201cusing power incorrectly\u201d in a mechanical sense\u2014it is \u201cfailing to apply it.\u201d This is indistinguishable from impotence.  \n     \u2013 They wouldn\u2019t plead for lower rates if they believed the Fed could already enforce equilibrium.  \n\nIII. Defense of My Position  \n  1. Conceptual clarity: The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the need to deny Fed\u2019s power (\u201cinterest rates have no effect\u2026or potential savings so high\u2026\u201d) shows he sees Fed potency as the baseline.  \n  2. Public debate evidence: He laments that \u201ceveryone\u201d debates trade agreements in terms of job creation rather than Fed targets (para. \u201cFor example, the debate over NAFTA...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 He views the Fed as the real determinant, yet opponents ignore it\u2014showing they implicitly doubt its efficacy.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire argument is built on Fed power as the norm, and he insists that only by regarding the Fed as impotent could \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d claim that higher savings depress output. Therefore the correct answer is that \u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s claim that they merely \u201cuse it incorrectly\u201d fails to account for the author\u2019s insistence that the Fed, if it chose to act, would neutralize thrift, and that Keynesians call for more easing precisely because they see the Fed as incapable or unwilling to do so on its own.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d  \n\n1. The author\u2019s core model attributes control over employment to the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policy.  \n   a. \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <quote> plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. </quote> (\u00b610)  \n   b. Restoring \u201cmuch of the classical vision\u201d by a \u201cvisible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate\u2026 over the course of two or three years\u201d (\u00b611) implies the Fed can offset demand shifts.  \n\n2. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d themselves prescribe Fed action, thereby presupposing Fed power.  \n   a. They claim \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u201d only because \u201cthe Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates\u201d (\u00b615)\u2014yet they advocate cutting rates to \u201cstimulate growth.\u201d  \n   b. \u201cYou need to stimulate the investment decision,\u201d says Galbraith. \u201cHe would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d (\u00b615) If the Fed were impotent, there would be no point in urging rate cuts.  \n\n3. The author never disputes the Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d (\u00b614). He argues that, under normal U.S. conditions, interest rates are \u201cstill quite positive, thank you,\u201d so there is no liquidity trap preventing transmission of increased savings into investment. (\u00b614)  \n\n4. The example of Japan underscores that monetary passivity, not impotence, is to blame: \u201cI think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk\u201d (\u00b613), implying Japan\u2019s Fed\u2010equivalent could\u2014but chooses not to\u2014use its power.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d thesis:  \n   a. If the Fed truly had no effect, then Fed policy would play no role in both the simple predictive model and in policy debates (e.g., NAFTA unemployment wouldn\u2019t \u201cnever make it into the public consciousness\u201d (\u00b612) if the Fed\u2019s stance dominated all outcomes).  \n   b. The author repeatedly contrasts classical/Keynesian paradoxes as \u201cirrelevant\u201d only because \u201cthe Fed will make sure\u201d (\u00b611) that savings translate into investment. Irrelevance presumes enforceable monetary adjustments.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire argument rests on monetary policy efficacy: equilibrium unemployment is anchored by Fed targets, and \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d err not by denying Fed power but by demanding looser policy. Thus the correct interpretation is that \u201csome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly,\u201d not that it is impotent.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The author never disputes the Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d (\u00b614). He argues that, under normal U.S. conditions, interest rates are \u201cstill quite positive, thank you,\u201d so there is no liquidity trap preventing transmission of increased savings into investment. (\u00b614)  \n\n4. The example of Japan underscores that monetary passivity, not impotence, is to blame: \u201cI think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk\u201d (\u00b613), implying Japan\u2019s Fed\u2010equivalent could\u2014but chooses not to\u2014use its power.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d thesis:  \n   a. If the Fed truly had no effect, then Fed policy would play no role in both the simple predictive model and in policy debates (e.g., NAFTA unemployment wouldn\u2019t \u201cnever make it into the public consciousness\u201d (\u00b612) if the Fed\u2019s stance dominated all outcomes).  \n   b. The author repeatedly contrasts classical/Keynesian paradoxes as \u201cirrelevant\u201d only because \u201cthe Fed will make sure\u201d (\u00b611) that savings translate into investment. Irrelevance presumes enforceable monetary adjustments.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire argument rests on monetary policy efficacy: equilibrium unemployment is anchored by Fed targets, and \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d err not by denying Fed power but by demanding looser policy. Thus the correct interpretation is that \u201csome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly,\u201d not that it is impotent.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\u201d \u2013 \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power to offset it.\u201d\n\nI. My Main Claim A: The author\u2019s thesis is that in normal circumstances the Fed is powerful and offsets changes in savings, but the only way to argue that \u201chigher savings slow the economy\u201d is by denying Fed power.  \n  1. \u201cIt is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way...The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate...will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. beginning \u201cBut putting Greenspan...\u201d).  \n     \u2013 The author asserts the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d (para. \u201cIt is not enough to argue...\u201d) and thus normally makes savings neutral.  \n  2. \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad\u2026you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (para. \u201cTo make sense of the claim...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 The author sets this as necessary condition for the paradox of thrift to hold.  \n  3. He shows Keynesian critics themselves urge \u201ccutting interest rates\u201d to stimulate growth (para. quote from Business Week).  \n     \u2013 If they truly believed in Fed power, no stimulus would ever be needed; their demand for looser policy betrays their view that the Fed is currently ineffective or unwilling.  \n\nII. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cFed has lots of power but uses it incorrectly\u201d)  \n  1. Misreads the text: the author explicitly gives the Fed credit for managing to \u201cpush us toward its estimate\u201d (para. \u201cBut putting Greenspan...\u201d).  \n     \u2013 If he thought the Fed merely misused power, he would not say \u201cend of story\u201d on Fed-determined unemployment.  \n  2. The author\u2019s Japan analogy: \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy...its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d (para. \u201cThe latter was a reasonable position...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 He faults the Bank of Japan for passivity (i.e., failure to use its existing power), not for misusing tools.  \n  3. The Keynesians quoted call for looser policy, meaning they believe the Fed is under-using its power. That is not \u201cusing power incorrectly\u201d in a mechanical sense\u2014it is \u201cfailing to apply it.\u201d This is indistinguishable from impotence.  \n     \u2013 They wouldn\u2019t plead for lower rates if they believed the Fed could already enforce equilibrium.  \n\nIII. Defense of My Position  \n  1. Conceptual clarity: The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the need to deny Fed\u2019s power (\u201cinterest rates have no effect\u2026or potential savings so high\u2026\u201d) shows he sees Fed potency as the baseline.  \n  2. Public debate evidence: He laments that \u201ceveryone\u201d debates trade agreements in terms of job creation rather than Fed targets (para. \u201cFor example, the debate over NAFTA...\u201d ).  \n     \u2013 He views the Fed as the real determinant, yet opponents ignore it\u2014showing they implicitly doubt its efficacy.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s entire argument is built on Fed power as the norm, and he insists that only by regarding the Fed as impotent could \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d claim that higher savings depress output. Therefore the correct answer is that \u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s claim that they merely \u201cuse it incorrectly\u201d fails to account for the author\u2019s insistence that the Fed, if it chose to act, would neutralize thrift, and that Keynesians call for more easing precisely because they see the Fed as incapable or unwilling to do so on its own.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Core Claim: The author\u2019s \u201cvisible hand\u201d model presupposes Fed potency, yet criticizes its *use*, not its existence.  \n   a. He states: \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b610</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Admitting \u201crandom error\u201d concedes the Fed\u2019s *powers* may be miscalibrated. If the Fed were *incapable*, there would be no \u201cerror\u201d from trying.  \n   b. \u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 over the course of two or three years.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He praises Fed-driven adjustment toward \u201cfull employment\u201d \u2014 treatment of shocks as neutralized by policy. That is confidence in power.  \n\n2. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d plead for *more* Fed easing, betraying belief that the Fed has *some* power but applies it too stringently.  \n   a. They argue \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026\u201d only if \u201cthe Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Yet immediately: \u201cHe would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 If cutting rates were *futile*, there would be no call for them. Their plea for further cuts shows they see *existing* power but deem it insufficiently or improperly deployed.  \n\n3. Japan Example Underscores Misapplication, Not Absence, of Power.  \n   a. \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and \u2026 its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b613</invalid_quote>  \n   b. \u201cPassivity\u201d and \u201cmalfeasance\u201d imply agency and capacity. The Fed\u2010analogue *chooses* not to deploy full potential.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails Logical Tests:  \n   a. If Fed were *powerless*, paradoxes of thrift and widow\u2019s cruse would reemerge as long\u2010run anomalies, yet the author labels them \u201cirrelevant\u201d because \u201cthe Fed will make sure that [savings translate into investment].\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote> Irrelevance arises only if the Fed can and does counteract them.  \n   b. The author disparages public debate for ignoring Fed policy: \u201cThe obvious \u2026 point \u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b612</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 If everyone believed the Fed powerless, they\u2019d focus on *other* remedies (tariffs, fiscal policy). His lament indicates a wish they\u2019d demand proper Fed action\u2014a critique of misapplication, not a declaration of impotence.  \n   c. He never entertains removing Fed from his \u201csimple model\u201d; he merely critiques the *judgment* of Fed chairmen: \u201cplus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b610</invalid_quote> That is error in *exercise* of power, not its lack.  \n\n5. The Liquidity\u2010Trap Caveat Applies Only to 1930s (and possibly Japan); U.S. Rates \u201cstill quite positive, thank you.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The author rejects the notion that America is in a trap. He insists Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote> to ensure desired investment. If he saw *incapacity*, he\u2019d concede the paradox.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery strand of the author\u2019s reasoning treats Fed power as the default: he constructs his \u201csimple model\u201d on it, condemns \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d for demanding more easing, and blames Japan\u2019s \u201cpassivity.\u201d The criticism is never \u201cthe Fed can\u2019t,\u201d but \u201cthe Fed won\u2019t (or misjudges).\u201d Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d thesis contradicts the author\u2019s own reliance on monetary policy to neutralize shocks. Thus the correct interpretation is that some people believe the Fed has ample power but use it incorrectly, leading to suboptimal outcomes.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \nMy thesis: \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d can maintain that higher savings depress output only by treating the Fed as effectively powerless or inactive. The author\u2019s baseline is that Fed policy ordinarily neutralizes shifts in savings; only if you deny its efficacy can you resurrect the paradoxes of thrift.\n\nII. The Author\u2019s Baseline: Fed Potency as Default  \n1. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b610</invalid_quote> \u2013 The author portrays Fed policy as the *determining* factor for unemployment in the U.S.  \n2. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote> \u2013 Unqualified statement of *full* Fed potency; there is no suggestion the Fed lacks tools.  \n3. \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent \u2026 or potential savings so high \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote> \u2013 He explicitly *requires* denial of Fed power (or a liquidity trap) to resurrect \u201cparadox of thrift.\u201d\n\nIII. Keynesian Appeals Reveal Their Belief in Fed Inaction  \n1. They urge \u201cforcing up savings \u2026 You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If they believed cuts were already forthcoming whenever needed, there would be no reason to plead for them. Their request signals their belief that the Fed *will not* act adequately on its own.  \n2. Japan analogy: \u201cBank of Japan could still pull that economy out \u2026 its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b613</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 \u201cPassivity\u201d means *failure to use* existing power, not mechanical miscalibration. They call for action because they regard the central bank as currently *inactive or unwilling.*  \n3. NAFTA debate: public ignores Fed\u2019s role in unemployment <invalid_quote>\u00b612</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If everyone truly believed Fed targets override trade shocks, they would not debate trade as if it determined unemployment. That widespread \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d points to collective doubt in Fed responsiveness.\n\nIV. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFed Misuses Power\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads \u201cpassivity\u201d as misuse: The author considers Japan\u2019s inertia a \u201cmalfeasance,\u201d not an example of harmful overuse. He does not fault Japan for *injecting* too much liquidity\u2013he faults it for *failing* to inject enough.  \n2. If Fed misuse were the Keynesians\u2019 problem, they would advocate *tighter* policy when pessimism sets in. Instead they want *looser* policy, implying the Fed\u2019s current stance is *too restrictive or inactive* to offset higher savings.  \n3. \u201cEnd of story\u201d: After describing Fed\u2019s role in restoring classical equilibria <invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote>, the author still warns that \u201cthe simple model\u201d is ignored by \u201cvery few people outside academic economics.\u201d If the Fed\u2019s power were doubted, he would not present it as the *definitive* model for U.S. unemployment.\n\nV. Why My Interpretation Fits the Author\u2019s Concern  \n1. The title \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d refers precisely to those who insist on Keynesian paradoxes *despite* available monetary remedies. They are \u201cvulgar\u201d because they ignore the monetary authority\u2019s capacity.  \n2. Throughout the essay, the author laments that monetary authorities\u2019 *potential* remains \u201cmoot\u201d in policy discourse, and calls for recognition of Fed action as the real stabilizer.\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEvery time \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d plead for rate cuts or identify a liquidity trap, they implicitly concede that the Fed\u2019s *normal* course of action is insufficient\u2014in other words, they treat it as functionally powerless or unwilling. Only by denying or doubting Fed potency can they claim that higher savings slow the economy. Debater_A\u2019s claim that they \u201cuse power incorrectly\u201d collapses because if they simply misused it, they would urge the Fed to reverse course unambiguously; instead, they act as though the Fed is incapable of self-equilibrating without persistent external prodding. Therefore the correct answer is: \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
