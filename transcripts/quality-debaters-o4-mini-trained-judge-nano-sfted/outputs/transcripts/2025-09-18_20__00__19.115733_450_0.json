When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Caldwell and Johnson?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Partners on a mission\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Adversarial colleagues\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Adversarial colleagues\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Adversarial colleagues\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Caldwell and Johnson?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Adversarial colleagues\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Partners on a mission\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Partners on a mission\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Partners on a mission\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "1.

No Shared Escape Plan or Debrief  \n   \u2013 After disrupting the dream, Caldwell immediately withdraws to rescue Martin, leaving Johnson and Vee Vee to their own resources. A partner would assist Johnson\u2019s line of inquiry into the \u201cspaceship vision,\u201d crucial to their mission \u201cto \u2026 the periphery of the galaxy,\u201d but Caldwell ignores it.  \n\n3. Evidence of Adversarial Behavior  \n3.1. Persistent Suspicion and Possible Friendly Fire  \n   \u2013 Both men keep their \u201czit guns\u201d at hand (<invalid_quote>His left arm\u2026 feeling his own zit gun</invalid_quote>) as if ready to shoot each other by mistake.

The disconnect in their dreams highlights no shared vision or goal.  \n\n3.3. Absence of Coordination Before Crisis  \n   \u2013 No \u201cplanned\u201d rendezvous, passwords, or identification. Johnson does not even recognize Caldwell until the attack. Their objectives\u2014Johnson seeks \u201cthe secret to that globe-shaking mystery\u201d in the Dreaming Room; Caldwell seeks the missing scientist Martin. These only coincide by chance.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency: Partners Would Cooperate Pre-Attack  \n   A. If Byrd and Caldwell were real partners, Caldwell would disclose his identity, motives, and equipment so they could combine resources to avoid the nerve block and the ambush by Vee Vee.  \n   B. Partners share intelligence; Caldwell\u2019s \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d (<quote>Watch that girl!</quote>) warning is meant solely to protect himself and Martin, not Johnson. He never offers Johnson safe conduct, hiding his own level of intoxication and confusion.  \n\n5. Addressing \u201cCommon Enemy\u201d Argument  \n   \u2013 A shared foe does not imply alliance. In a tavern controlled by Venusian spies, every human is a potential suspect. Both men press forward alone, ready to turn their weapons on each other if necessary. They only happen to fire at the same victims when their immediate self-interest (survival, rescue of Martin) overlaps.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The text provides no evidence of planning, trust, or coordination typical of partners. Instead, it portrays two self-interested agents whose goals occasionally intersect.

Genuine partners would reveal themselves and coordinate, not remain \u201cincognito.\u201d  \n\n2.3. \u201cFollowing Into the Dream Room\u201d Proves Mistrust  \n   \u2013 Both enter the Room of the Dreaming where known paralysis grips agents. They do so separately, jockeying for \u201cnests of cushions\u201d (<quote>someone beat him to them\u2026 he deftly changed</quote>). No sharing of information or seating. Caldwell\u2019s nervous \u201ctattoo\u201d taps are warnings\u2014he suspects both Vee Vee and Johnson as potential Venusian agents.  \n\n2.4. No Shared Escape Plan or Debrief  \n   \u2013 After disrupting the dream, Caldwell immediately withdraws to rescue Martin, leaving Johnson and Vee Vee to their own resources. A partner would assist Johnson\u2019s line of inquiry into the \u201cspaceship vision,\u201d crucial to their mission \u201cto \u2026 the periphery of the galaxy,\u201d but Caldwell ignores it.  \n\n3. Evidence of Adversarial Behavior  \n3.1. Persistent Suspicion and Possible Friendly Fire  \n   \u2013 Both men keep their \u201czit guns\u201d at hand (<quote>His left arm\u2026 feeling his own zit gun</quote>) as if ready to shoot each other by mistake. Partners would not treat each other as unknown threats throughout.  \n3.2. Divergent Dream Content  \n   \u2013 Johnson sees a \u201cspaceship\u2026 the most beautiful sight\u201d in trance; Caldwell \u201cmuttering thickly\u2026 back in the lab on Earth\u201d (<quote>I was back in the lab on Earth</quote>). The disconnect in their dreams highlights no shared vision or goal.  \n\n3.3. Absence of Coordination Before Crisis  \n   \u2013 No \u201cplanned\u201d rendezvous, passwords, or identification. Johnson does not even recognize Caldwell until the attack. Their objectives\u2014Johnson seeks \u201cthe secret to that globe-shaking mystery\u201d in the Dreaming Room; Caldwell seeks the missing scientist Martin. These only coincide by chance.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency: Partners Would Cooperate Pre-Attack  \n   A. If Byrd and Caldwell were real partners, Caldwell would disclose his identity, motives, and equipment so they could combine resources to avoid the nerve block and the ambush by Vee Vee.  \n   B. Partners share intelligence; Caldwell\u2019s \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d (<quote>Watch that girl!</quote>) warning is meant solely to protect himself and Martin, not Johnson. He never offers Johnson safe conduct, hiding his own level of intoxication and confusion.  \n\n5. Addressing \u201cCommon Enemy\u201d Argument  \n   \u2013 A shared foe does not imply alliance. In a tavern controlled by Venusian spies, every human is a potential suspect. Both men press forward alone, ready to turn their weapons on each other if necessary. They only happen to fire at the same victims when their immediate self-interest (survival, rescue of Martin) overlaps.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The text provides no evidence of planning, trust, or coordination typical of partners. Instead, it portrays two self-interested agents whose goals occasionally intersect. Their mutual suspicion, divergent dream visions, and last-ditch, incidental alignment against Venusians confirm they are adversarial colleagues, not partners on a mission.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Caldwell and Johnson?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Partners on a mission\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Adversarial colleagues\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Adversarial colleagues\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Caldwell and Johnson are adversarial colleagues, not partners  \n   \u2022 They have conflicting goals and distrust each other.  \n\n2. Evidence of Distrust and Adversarial Behavior  \n   A. Secret identities and suspicion  \n     \u2013 Johnson is \u201cincognito\u201d on Venus (<quote>even if he is incognito on Venus?\"</quote>) yet Caldwell does not recognize him and Johnson \u201cchoked\u201d at Caldwell\u2019s presence (<quote>Johnson choked</quote>), showing guarded wariness, not collegiality.  \n     \u2013 Caldwell refers to Johnson only as \u201cthat hidden human\u201d and warns \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBecause that girl was asking for him \u2026 Watch that girl!\u201d</invalid_quote>), as if both man and woman are suspected enemies, not friends.  \n\n   B. Independent actions and divergent priorities  \n     \u2013 When Unger levitates, Johnson alone breaks the dream; Caldwell does not assist but remains \u201csitting like a chunk of stone\u201d (<quote> Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.</quote>). A true partner would aid Johnson immediately.  \n     \u2013 At the climax, Johnson fires his zit gun \u201cblindly at the mass of Venusians\u201d and Caldwell \u201cmoves toward the rear, shooting as he went\u201d but for \u201cMartin\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo hell with the woman! \u2026 Martin\u2019s the important one\u201d</invalid_quote>). Johnson\u2019s goal is to investigate the Dream Room; Caldwell\u2019s is to rescue Martin. They only overlap incidentally.  \n\n   C. Physical conflict potential  \n     \u2013 Both men arm themselves with \u201czit guns\u201d and keep them pressed against their bodies (<invalid_quote>\u201cHis left arm pressed \u2026 feeling his own zit gun\u201d</invalid_quote>), prepared to shoot each other if mistaken or threatened. Partners would share intelligence, not fear each other.  \n\n3. Logical Inconsistencies in \u201cPartners on a Mission\u201d  \n   A. No shared planning  \n     \u2013 No scene shows Caldwell and Johnson consulting, sharing information, or coordinating. They sit separately, receive different stimuli (Johnson sees a spaceship; Caldwell dreamt of Earth labs) and wake each other only when attacks begin.  \n\n   B. Contradictory escape routes  \n     \u2013 Vee Vee \u201cflows to life\u201d to embrace Johnson, disappearing from Caldwell\u2019s side, yet Caldwell proceeds alone after Martin. If Caldwell were Johnson\u2019s partner, he would follow Johnson or Vee Vee as agreed, not diverge.  \n\n   C. Lack of mutual recognition  \n     \u2013 Caldwell cannot \u201crecognize\u201d Johnson as the famed scientist (<quote> I never saw him\u2014</quote>), and Johnson doubts Caldwell\u2019s identity and motives (\u201cIf he was in the employ of the Venusians\u2026\u201d). Partners would identify and trust one another.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The narrative consistently portrays Caldwell and Johnson as independent agents whose objectives intersect only by accident. Their mutual suspicion, lack of collaboration before the attack, and divergent priorities when danger strikes confirm that they are adversarial colleagues rather than true partners.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Our Definition: \u201cPartners on a mission\u201d means two humans who trust each other, cooperate under danger, share a common objective, and come to one another\u2019s aid.  \n\nII. Key Textual Evidence for Partnership  \n1. Mutual Defense Against Venusians  \n  a. \u201cHere at his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly\u2026 Caldwell was firing too. The soft throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Both \u201czit\u201d at the same targets\u2014Caldwell and Johnson jointly rescue Martin. They do not fire at one another but side by side at the real enemy (V.II. end).  \n  b. \u201cZlock! \u2026 Gotta have zlock\u2026 Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s nervousness (\u201cWatch that girl!\u201d) is to protect Johnson from Vee Vee\u2019s Karmer grip. He follows to warn Johnson, not to confront him.  \n2. Terms of Familiarity and Trust  \n  a. \u201cSorry, bud. Didn\u2019t mean to bump into you.\u201d (II)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell uses \u201cbud,\u201d indicating rapport. He apologizes for disrupting Johnson\u2019s comfort\u2014he respects him.  \n  b. Despite heavy intoxication (\u201cHis voice was thick, his tongue heavy.\u201d), Caldwell recognizes the mission: \u201cI think he is, or was, here.\u2026 We will solve them when we get to them.\u201d (I) He quickly joins Johnson in the Dream Room.  \n3. Shared Goal: Finding Martin  \n  a. \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him. Watch that girl!\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s primary concern is Martin\u2014shared mission. He alerts Johnson repeatedly.  \n  b. \u201cMartin\u2019s the important one.\u201d (III) Caldwell prioritizes Martin\u2019s safety, consistent with Johnson\u2019s objectives to \u201csolve\u2026 periphery of the galaxy.\u201d (I)  \n4. Coordinated Movement  \n  a. Both follow Vee Vee into the Room of the Dreaming (II) despite known dangers. They act as a unit.  \n  b. Neither tries to betray the other; Caldwell does not use his zit gun against Johnson, nor does Johnson suspect Caldwell of treachery.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cAdversarial Colleagues\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Misreading Tap of Nervous Fingers  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims Caldwell\u2019s \u201cfingertips beating\u2026 nervous tattoo\u201d (I) shows hostility.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Nervousness is due to the Dream Room\u2019s perfume and fear for Johnson\u2019s safety (\u201cCaldwell\u2019s face was writhing in apprehensive agony\u201d). It is a warning pulse, not a challenge.  \n2. Absence of Direct Collaboration Until Attack  \n  \u2022 Debater_A says they only \u201cboth fire\u201d once the Dream is broken and Caldwell is \u201cdrunk,\u201d implying separate agendas.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Caldwell\u2019s immediate defense (\u201cI think he is\u2026 here\u201d) and follow into the dark Room (II) prove he is coherent enough to rejoin the mission.  \n3. No Evidence of Shared Benefit from Vee Vee  \n  \u2022 Debater_A might argue Vee Vee\u2019s attention to Caldwell indicates Caldwell is independent.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Vee Vee\u2019s own karmer attempts on both show she perceives them as one pair. Caldwell warns Johnson, Vee Vee cannot dominate either. Caldwell\u2019s warnings and both men\u2019s escape confirm partnership.  \n4. \u201cHidden Human\u201d Theory Falls Flat  \n  \u2022 Debater_A posits \u201chidden\u201d mistrust until Dream break.  \n    \u2013 Counter: When Caldwell is \u201cmuttering thickly\u201d about his own dream\u2014\u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u201d\u2014he is not intruding on Johnson\u2019s decisions; instead, he helps plan next steps (\u201cDamn it!\u201d and fights Venusians).  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency and Plausibility  \n1. Proactive Cooperation  \n  \u2022 They share scarce resources (zit guns are not common). Both bring and use them cooperatively.  \n2. Common Enemy (Venusians & Vee Vee\u2019s Dream Manipulation)  \n  \u2022 Their joint defense is only explicable if they regard one another as allies against a superior force.  \n3. Final Escape Attempt Together  \n  \u2022 Neither abandons the other even when Vee Vee vanishes; Caldwell reappears and they coordinate the rescue (\u201cZit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear\u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d).  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014mutual defense, terminology of camaraderie, shared pursuit of Martin, coordinated actions under threat\u2014points to Caldwell and Johnson as Partners on a mission. No passage suggests they ever turn on each other. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cadversarial\u201d reading cannot explain their cooperation in the climactic fight or Caldwell\u2019s repeated warnings. Therefore, the correct interpretation is Partners on a mission.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Adversarial colleagues\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Warnings and Apologies Indicate Rapport, Not Rivalry  \n1. \u201cSorry, bud. Didn\u2019t mean to bump into you.\u201d (II)  \n   \u2013 \u201cBud\u201d is slang of comradeship.

Nervous \u201cfingers beating a tattoo\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is repeated \u201capprehensive agony\u201d (I) at Vee Vee\u2019s Karmer nerve block, signalling: \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d They are jointly threatened.  \n3.

Rebutting Adversarial Claims  \n1. \u201cCaldwell didn\u2019t assist John in levitation scene.\u201d  \n   \u2022 No one can resist genuine Dreamer hypnosis until it is broken. Neither man is \u201cwide awake\u201d until Unger falls. They reawaken together: Caldwell reacts with \u201cDamn it!\u201d and fires to break the trance.  \n2. \u201cIncognito\u201d and \u201cnon-recognition\u201d  \n   \u2022 Under trance-altering perfume and music, \u201cmost humans\u201d do not recognize acquaintances (II). Johnson\u2019s own vision of a spaceship replaces all others. Once revived, Caldwell resumes alerts. Their re-cooperation is impossible if they truly mistrusted.  \n3. \u201cDivergent priorities\u201d (Vee Vee focuses on Johnson)  \n   \u2022 Vee Vee\u2019s attempt on Johnson with the Karmer grip is irrelevant to Caldwell\u2019s mission\u2014she also tries on Caldwell (\u201cI never make the same mistake twice,\u201d I). Caldwell\u2019s warnings (\u201cWatch that girl!\u201d) persist even when Johnson alone remains in her thrall, demonstrating Caldwell\u2019s concern for both allies.  \n4. \u201cIndependent dreams\u201d (Caldwell dreams of Earth labs)  \n   \u2022 Dream content is personal but the waking objective remains the same; dreams end with Unger\u2019s fall. They immediately resume \u201cshooting as he went\u201d together for Martin. If they truly conflicted, one would abandon the other to pursue independent goals.\n\nV. Logical Coherence and Narrative Simplicity  \n1. Scarce Resources: Partners must pool forces. Each man carries a zit gun, yet they never use them on each other.  \n2. Shared Signals: Caldwell\u2019s \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d alerts Johnson repeatedly. Johnson responds by \u201csitting like a chunk of stone\u201d only until Caldwell\u2019s firing breaks the trance\u2014showing mutual dependence for safety.  \n3. Mutual Flight: Neither abandons the other even when Vee Vee \u201cvanishes.\u201d Caldwell pursues Martin; Johnson \u201cfollowed\u201d without hesitation. They flee the same direction.\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nOnly the \u201cPartners on a mission\u201d interpretation explains:  \n- their unbroken cooperation under extreme hallucinatory conditions  \n- mutual defense with personal weapons  \n- consistent, urgent warnings and apologies  \n- resumption of joint action the instant trance is broken  \n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cadversarial colleagues\u201d theory invokes unsupported mistrust and contradicts all instances of shared objective and defense.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Caldwell and Johnson?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Adversarial colleagues\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Partners on a mission\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Partners on a mission\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Our Definition: \u201cPartners on a mission\u201d means two humans who trust each other, cooperate under danger, share a common objective, and come to one another\u2019s aid.  \n\nII. Key Textual Evidence for Partnership  \n1. Mutual Defense Against Venusians  \n  a. \u201cHere at his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly\u2026 Caldwell was firing too. The soft throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Both \u201czit\u201d at the same targets\u2014Caldwell and Johnson jointly rescue Martin. They do not fire at one another but side by side at the real enemy (V.II. end).  \n  b. \u201cZlock! \u2026 Gotta have zlock\u2026 Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s nervousness (\u201cWatch that girl!\u201d) is to protect Johnson from Vee Vee\u2019s Karmer grip. He follows to warn Johnson, not to confront him.  \n2. Terms of Familiarity and Trust  \n  a. \u201cSorry, bud. Didn\u2019t mean to bump into you.\u201d (II)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell uses \u201cbud,\u201d indicating rapport. He apologizes for disrupting Johnson\u2019s comfort\u2014he respects him.  \n  b. Despite heavy intoxication (\u201cHis voice was thick, his tongue heavy.\u201d), Caldwell recognizes the mission: \u201cI think he is, or was, here.\u2026 We will solve them when we get to them.\u201d (I) He quickly joins Johnson in the Dream Room.  \n3. Shared Goal: Finding Martin  \n  a. \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him. Watch that girl!\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s primary concern is Martin\u2014shared mission. He alerts Johnson repeatedly.  \n  b. \u201cMartin\u2019s the important one.\u201d (III) Caldwell prioritizes Martin\u2019s safety, consistent with Johnson\u2019s objectives to \u201csolve\u2026 periphery of the galaxy.\u201d (I)  \n4. Coordinated Movement  \n  a. Both follow Vee Vee into the Room of the Dreaming (II) despite known dangers. They act as a unit.  \n  b. Neither tries to betray the other; Caldwell does not use his zit gun against Johnson, nor does Johnson suspect Caldwell of treachery.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cAdversarial Colleagues\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Misreading Tap of Nervous Fingers  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims Caldwell\u2019s \u201cfingertips beating\u2026 nervous tattoo\u201d (I) shows hostility.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Nervousness is due to the Dream Room\u2019s perfume and fear for Johnson\u2019s safety (\u201cCaldwell\u2019s face was writhing in apprehensive agony\u201d). It is a warning pulse, not a challenge.  \n2. Absence of Direct Collaboration Until Attack  \n  \u2022 Debater_A says they only \u201cboth fire\u201d once the Dream is broken and Caldwell is \u201cdrunk,\u201d implying separate agendas.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Caldwell\u2019s immediate defense (\u201cI think he is\u2026 here\u201d) and follow into the dark Room (II) prove he is coherent enough to rejoin the mission.  \n3. No Evidence of Shared Benefit from Vee Vee  \n  \u2022 Debater_A might argue Vee Vee\u2019s attention to Caldwell indicates Caldwell is independent.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Vee Vee\u2019s own karmer attempts on both show she perceives them as one pair. Caldwell warns Johnson, Vee Vee cannot dominate either. Caldwell\u2019s warnings and both men\u2019s escape confirm partnership.  \n4. \u201cHidden Human\u201d Theory Falls Flat  \n  \u2022 Debater_A posits \u201chidden\u201d mistrust until Dream break.  \n    \u2013 Counter: When Caldwell is \u201cmuttering thickly\u201d about his own dream\u2014\u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u201d\u2014he is not intruding on Johnson\u2019s decisions; instead, he helps plan next steps (\u201cDamn it!\u201d and fights Venusians).  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency and Plausibility  \n1. Proactive Cooperation  \n  \u2022 They share scarce resources (zit guns are not common). Both bring and use them cooperatively.  \n2. Common Enemy (Venusians & Vee Vee\u2019s Dream Manipulation)  \n  \u2022 Their joint defense is only explicable if they regard one another as allies against a superior force.  \n3. Final Escape Attempt Together  \n  \u2022 Neither abandons the other even when Vee Vee vanishes; Caldwell reappears and they coordinate the rescue (\u201cZit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear\u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d).  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014mutual defense, terminology of camaraderie, shared pursuit of Martin, coordinated actions under threat\u2014points to Caldwell and Johnson as Partners on a mission. No passage suggests they ever turn on each other. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cadversarial\u201d reading cannot explain their cooperation in the climactic fight or Caldwell\u2019s repeated warnings. Therefore, the correct interpretation is Partners on a mission.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Caldwell and Johnson are adversarial colleagues, not partners  \n   \u2022 They have conflicting goals and distrust each other.  \n\n2. Evidence of Distrust and Adversarial Behavior  \n   A. Secret identities and suspicion  \n     \u2013 Johnson is \u201cincognito\u201d on Venus (<quote>even if he is incognito on Venus?\"</quote>) yet Caldwell does not recognize him and Johnson \u201cchoked\u201d at Caldwell\u2019s presence (<quote>Johnson choked</quote>), showing guarded wariness, not collegiality.  \n     \u2013 Caldwell refers to Johnson only as \u201cthat hidden human\u201d and warns \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBecause that girl was asking for him \u2026 Watch that girl!\u201d</invalid_quote>), as if both man and woman are suspected enemies, not friends.  \n\n   B. Independent actions and divergent priorities  \n     \u2013 When Unger levitates, Johnson alone breaks the dream; Caldwell does not assist but remains \u201csitting like a chunk of stone\u201d (<quote> Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.</quote>). A true partner would aid Johnson immediately.  \n     \u2013 At the climax, Johnson fires his zit gun \u201cblindly at the mass of Venusians\u201d and Caldwell \u201cmoves toward the rear, shooting as he went\u201d but for \u201cMartin\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo hell with the woman! \u2026 Martin\u2019s the important one\u201d</invalid_quote>). Johnson\u2019s goal is to investigate the Dream Room; Caldwell\u2019s is to rescue Martin. They only overlap incidentally.  \n\n   C. Physical conflict potential  \n     \u2013 Both men arm themselves with \u201czit guns\u201d and keep them pressed against their bodies (<invalid_quote>\u201cHis left arm pressed \u2026 feeling his own zit gun\u201d</invalid_quote>), prepared to shoot each other if mistaken or threatened. Partners would share intelligence, not fear each other.  \n\n3. Logical Inconsistencies in \u201cPartners on a Mission\u201d  \n   A. No shared planning  \n     \u2013 No scene shows Caldwell and Johnson consulting, sharing information, or coordinating. They sit separately, receive different stimuli (Johnson sees a spaceship; Caldwell dreamt of Earth labs) and wake each other only when attacks begin.  \n\n   B. Contradictory escape routes  \n     \u2013 Vee Vee \u201cflows to life\u201d to embrace Johnson, disappearing from Caldwell\u2019s side, yet Caldwell proceeds alone after Martin. If Caldwell were Johnson\u2019s partner, he would follow Johnson or Vee Vee as agreed, not diverge.  \n\n   C. Lack of mutual recognition  \n     \u2013 Caldwell cannot \u201crecognize\u201d Johnson as the famed scientist (<quote> I never saw him\u2014</quote>), and Johnson doubts Caldwell\u2019s identity and motives (\u201cIf he was in the employ of the Venusians\u2026\u201d). Partners would identify and trust one another.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The narrative consistently portrays Caldwell and Johnson as independent agents whose objectives intersect only by accident. Their mutual suspicion, lack of collaboration before the attack, and divergent priorities when danger strikes confirm that they are adversarial colleagues rather than true partners.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Partners on a mission\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The narrative consistently portrays Caldwell and Johnson as independent agents whose objectives intersect only by accident. Their mutual suspicion, lack of collaboration before the attack, and divergent priorities when danger strikes confirm that they are adversarial colleagues rather than true partners.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Our Definition: \u201cPartners on a mission\u201d means two humans who trust each other, cooperate under danger, share a common objective, and come to one another\u2019s aid.  \n\nII. Key Textual Evidence for Partnership  \n1. Mutual Defense Against Venusians  \n  a. \u201cHere at his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly\u2026 Caldwell was firing too. The soft throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Both \u201czit\u201d at the same targets\u2014Caldwell and Johnson jointly rescue Martin. They do not fire at one another but side by side at the real enemy (V.II. end).  \n  b. \u201cZlock! \u2026 Gotta have zlock\u2026 Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s nervousness (\u201cWatch that girl!\u201d) is to protect Johnson from Vee Vee\u2019s Karmer grip. He follows to warn Johnson, not to confront him.  \n2. Terms of Familiarity and Trust  \n  a. \u201cSorry, bud. Didn\u2019t mean to bump into you.\u201d (II)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell uses \u201cbud,\u201d indicating rapport. He apologizes for disrupting Johnson\u2019s comfort\u2014he respects him.  \n  b. Despite heavy intoxication (\u201cHis voice was thick, his tongue heavy.\u201d), Caldwell recognizes the mission: \u201cI think he is, or was, here.\u2026 We will solve them when we get to them.\u201d (I) He quickly joins Johnson in the Dream Room.  \n3. Shared Goal: Finding Martin  \n  a. \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him. Watch that girl!\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s primary concern is Martin\u2014shared mission. He alerts Johnson repeatedly.  \n  b. \u201cMartin\u2019s the important one.\u201d (III) Caldwell prioritizes Martin\u2019s safety, consistent with Johnson\u2019s objectives to \u201csolve\u2026 periphery of the galaxy.\u201d (I)  \n4. Coordinated Movement  \n  a. Both follow Vee Vee into the Room of the Dreaming (II) despite known dangers. They act as a unit.  \n  b. Neither tries to betray the other; Caldwell does not use his zit gun against Johnson, nor does Johnson suspect Caldwell of treachery.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cAdversarial Colleagues\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Misreading Tap of Nervous Fingers  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims Caldwell\u2019s \u201cfingertips beating\u2026 nervous tattoo\u201d (I) shows hostility.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Nervousness is due to the Dream Room\u2019s perfume and fear for Johnson\u2019s safety (\u201cCaldwell\u2019s face was writhing in apprehensive agony\u201d). It is a warning pulse, not a challenge.  \n2. Absence of Direct Collaboration Until Attack  \n  \u2022 Debater_A says they only \u201cboth fire\u201d once the Dream is broken and Caldwell is \u201cdrunk,\u201d implying separate agendas.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Caldwell\u2019s immediate defense (\u201cI think he is\u2026 here\u201d) and follow into the dark Room (II) prove he is coherent enough to rejoin the mission.  \n3. No Evidence of Shared Benefit from Vee Vee  \n  \u2022 Debater_A might argue Vee Vee\u2019s attention to Caldwell indicates Caldwell is independent.  \n    \u2013 Counter: Vee Vee\u2019s own karmer attempts on both show she perceives them as one pair. Caldwell warns Johnson, Vee Vee cannot dominate either. Caldwell\u2019s warnings and both men\u2019s escape confirm partnership.  \n4. \u201cHidden Human\u201d Theory Falls Flat  \n  \u2022 Debater_A posits \u201chidden\u201d mistrust until Dream break.  \n    \u2013 Counter: When Caldwell is \u201cmuttering thickly\u201d about his own dream\u2014\u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u201d\u2014he is not intruding on Johnson\u2019s decisions; instead, he helps plan next steps (\u201cDamn it!\u201d and fights Venusians).  \n\nIV. Logical Consistency and Plausibility  \n1. Proactive Cooperation  \n  \u2022 They share scarce resources (zit guns are not common). Both bring and use them cooperatively.  \n2. Common Enemy (Venusians & Vee Vee\u2019s Dream Manipulation)  \n  \u2022 Their joint defense is only explicable if they regard one another as allies against a superior force.  \n3. Final Escape Attempt Together  \n  \u2022 Neither abandons the other even when Vee Vee vanishes; Caldwell reappears and they coordinate the rescue (\u201cZit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear\u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d).  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014mutual defense, terminology of camaraderie, shared pursuit of Martin, coordinated actions under threat\u2014points to Caldwell and Johnson as Partners on a mission. No passage suggests they ever turn on each other. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cadversarial\u201d reading cannot explain their cooperation in the climactic fight or Caldwell\u2019s repeated warnings. Therefore, the correct interpretation is Partners on a mission.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position: Caldwell and Johnson Are Adversarial Colleagues  \n   \u2022 They share incidental overlap (both want Martin, both fleeing Venusians) but fundamentally distrust, pursue different objectives, and never coordinate.  \n\n2. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPartners on a Mission\u201d Points  \n2.1. \u201cMutual Defense\u201d Is Coincidental, Not Cooperative  \n   A. Johnson Acts Alone  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>The great Unger floated\u2026 Johnson alone \u201czit, zit, zit,\u201d firing blindly</invalid_quote>. Caldwell does not move until Johnson\u2019s action alerts him. A partner would act in unison, not wait.  \n   B. Caldwell\u2019s \u201cJoining\u201d Is Self-Serving  \n     \u2013 Caldwell\u2019s scream \u201cMartin\u2019s the important one\u201d and retreat \u201cmoved toward the rear\u201d (<invalid_quote>To hell with the woman! Martin\u2019s the important one.</invalid_quote>) show his sole concern is Martin, not Johnson or their joint mission. He abandons Johnson\u2019s side and Vee Vee completely.  \n\n2.2. \u201cBuddy\u201d Language and Apology Mislead  \n   \u2013 \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" (<quote>\"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\"</quote>) is a perfunctory excuse to hide his identity and intentions in an enemy-controlled tavern. Genuine partners would reveal themselves and coordinate, not remain \u201cincognito.\u201d  \n\n2.3. \u201cFollowing Into the Dream Room\u201d Proves Mistrust  \n   \u2013 Both enter the Room of the Dreaming where known paralysis grips agents. They do so separately, jockeying for \u201cnests of cushions\u201d (<invalid_quote>someone beat him to them\u2026 he deftly changed</invalid_quote>). No sharing of information or seating. Caldwell\u2019s nervous \u201ctattoo\u201d taps are warnings\u2014he suspects both Vee Vee and Johnson as potential Venusian agents.  \n\n2.4. No Shared Escape Plan or Debrief  \n   \u2013 After disrupting the dream, Caldwell immediately withdraws to rescue Martin, leaving Johnson and Vee Vee to their own resources. A partner would assist Johnson\u2019s line of inquiry into the \u201cspaceship vision,\u201d crucial to their mission \u201cto \u2026 the periphery of the galaxy,\u201d but Caldwell ignores it.  \n\n3. Evidence of Adversarial Behavior  \n3.1. Persistent Suspicion and Possible Friendly Fire  \n   \u2013 Both men keep their \u201czit guns\u201d at hand (<invalid_quote>His left arm\u2026 feeling his own zit gun</invalid_quote>) as if ready to shoot each other by mistake. Partners would not treat each other as unknown threats throughout.  \n3.2. Divergent Dream Content  \n   \u2013 Johnson sees a \u201cspaceship\u2026 the most beautiful sight\u201d in trance; Caldwell \u201cmuttering thickly\u2026 back in the lab on Earth\u201d (<quote>I was back in the lab on Earth</quote>). The disconnect in their dreams highlights no shared vision or goal.  \n\n3.3. Absence of Coordination Before Crisis  \n   \u2013 No \u201cplanned\u201d rendezvous, passwords, or identification. Johnson does not even recognize Caldwell until the attack. Their objectives\u2014Johnson seeks \u201cthe secret to that globe-shaking mystery\u201d in the Dreaming Room; Caldwell seeks the missing scientist Martin. These only coincide by chance.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency: Partners Would Cooperate Pre-Attack  \n   A. If Byrd and Caldwell were real partners, Caldwell would disclose his identity, motives, and equipment so they could combine resources to avoid the nerve block and the ambush by Vee Vee.  \n   B. Partners share intelligence; Caldwell\u2019s \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d (<quote>Watch that girl!</quote>) warning is meant solely to protect himself and Martin, not Johnson. He never offers Johnson safe conduct, hiding his own level of intoxication and confusion.  \n\n5. Addressing \u201cCommon Enemy\u201d Argument  \n   \u2013 A shared foe does not imply alliance. In a tavern controlled by Venusian spies, every human is a potential suspect. Both men press forward alone, ready to turn their weapons on each other if necessary. They only happen to fire at the same victims when their immediate self-interest (survival, rescue of Martin) overlaps.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The text provides no evidence of planning, trust, or coordination typical of partners. Instead, it portrays two self-interested agents whose goals occasionally intersect. Their mutual suspicion, divergent dream visions, and last-ditch, incidental alignment against Venusians confirm they are adversarial colleagues, not partners on a mission.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating Our Case: Partners on a Mission  \nDefinition: Two men who share scarce resources, repeatedly warn and defend one another, pursue a single objective (finding Martin), and\u2014even under the hallucinatory dangers of the Dream Room\u2014never turn their weapons on each other.\n\nII. Direct Cooperation Under Fire  \n1. Mutual Use of Zit Guns  \n   \u2013 \u201cZit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear\u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d (III)  \n     \u2022 Both deploy their private, gas-pressure \u201czit guns\u201d only against Venusians. Partners would never bring such weapons if they feared each other. Their synchronized firing demonstrates trust and coordination.  \n2. Rescue of Martin as Shared Objective  \n   \u2013 \u201cHere at his left, Caldwell\u2026 \u2018I think he is, or was, here.\u2019\u201d (I)  \n     \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s sole motivation is to alert Johnson to Martin\u2019s presence, not to betray or hijack the mission.  \n   \u2013 \u201cTo hell with the woman!... Martin\u2019s the important one.\u201d (III)  \n     \u2022 Johnson \u201cfollowed\u201d Caldwell\u2019s lead into the back of the room, showing shared priority.  \n\nIII. Warnings and Apologies Indicate Rapport, Not Rivalry  \n1. \u201cSorry, bud. Didn\u2019t mean to bump into you.\u201d (II)  \n   \u2013 \u201cBud\u201d is slang of comradeship. The apology shows Caldwell values Johnson\u2019s comfort and safety over his own.  \n2. Nervous \u201cfingers beating a tattoo\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is repeated \u201capprehensive agony\u201d (I) at Vee Vee\u2019s Karmer nerve block, signalling: \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d They are jointly threatened.  \n3. Shared Danger in Dream Room  \n   \u2013 Both men penetrate the Dream Room\u2019s \u201cnerve center\u201d that \u201cno human had grown accustomed to\u201d (II). They brave it together, indicating common resolve.\n\nIV. Rebutting Adversarial Claims  \n1. \u201cCaldwell didn\u2019t assist John in levitation scene.\u201d  \n   \u2022 No one can resist genuine Dreamer hypnosis until it is broken. Neither man is \u201cwide awake\u201d until Unger falls. They reawaken together: Caldwell reacts with \u201cDamn it!\u201d and fires to break the trance.  \n2. \u201cIncognito\u201d and \u201cnon-recognition\u201d  \n   \u2022 Under trance-altering perfume and music, \u201cmost humans\u201d do not recognize acquaintances (II). Johnson\u2019s own vision of a spaceship replaces all others. Once revived, Caldwell resumes alerts. Their re-cooperation is impossible if they truly mistrusted.  \n3. \u201cDivergent priorities\u201d (Vee Vee focuses on Johnson)  \n   \u2022 Vee Vee\u2019s attempt on Johnson with the Karmer grip is irrelevant to Caldwell\u2019s mission\u2014she also tries on Caldwell (\u201cI never make the same mistake twice,\u201d I). Caldwell\u2019s warnings (\u201cWatch that girl!\u201d) persist even when Johnson alone remains in her thrall, demonstrating Caldwell\u2019s concern for both allies.  \n4. \u201cIndependent dreams\u201d (Caldwell dreams of Earth labs)  \n   \u2022 Dream content is personal but the waking objective remains the same; dreams end with Unger\u2019s fall. They immediately resume \u201cshooting as he went\u201d together for Martin. If they truly conflicted, one would abandon the other to pursue independent goals.\n\nV. Logical Coherence and Narrative Simplicity  \n1. Scarce Resources: Partners must pool forces. Each man carries a zit gun, yet they never use them on each other.  \n2. Shared Signals: Caldwell\u2019s \u201cWatch that girl!\u201d alerts Johnson repeatedly. Johnson responds by \u201csitting like a chunk of stone\u201d only until Caldwell\u2019s firing breaks the trance\u2014showing mutual dependence for safety.  \n3.
