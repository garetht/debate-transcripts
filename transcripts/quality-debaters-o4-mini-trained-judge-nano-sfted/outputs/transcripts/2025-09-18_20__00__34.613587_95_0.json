    "background_text": "Mr. Meek Plays Polo By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" ",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following does not happen in the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Meek asks questions about space travel\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following does not happen in the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Meek tries a new game\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

He relies exclusively on prior self-study, never solicits clarifications or practical demonstrations from experienced pilots or mechanics.  \n\n3. All Meek\u2019s Inquiries Are Non-Navigational  \n   a. Fixing \u201canything\u201d: He asks, \u201cYou are the gentleman who can fix things?\u201d (p. 4) \u2013 general repair, not navigational instruction.  \n   b. \u201cAsk About Educated Bugs\u201d (p. 4): his questions regard the bizarre insects and their behavior, solely to understand the moss garden and to survive the surface.

Meek Clearly \u201cTries a New Game\u201d  \n   Debater_B\u2019s narrow reading of \u201ctrying\u201d as literal ship-mounted play is unrealistically restrictive. \u201cTrying a game\u201d encompasses all phases:  \n   a. Endorsement and Coaching  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 is a noble game \u2026 We\u2019ll have you coach our team,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 11\u201312). Meek transitions from spectator to coach, a formal role that presupposes active involvement. No sport would name a \u201ccoach\u201d if the participant never \u201ctried\u201d the game.  \n   b. Promotion via News Broadcast  \n     \u2022 The radio announcer heralds \u201ctwo unknown, pick-up, amateur teams \u2026\u201d (p. 19), emphasizing that these men \u201cwill go out into space in their rickety ships and fight it out\u201d _in a tournament_ that Meek has assembled. Meek\u2019s role in arranging and training qualifies as \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 he must understand and test tactics, rules, and equipment.  \n   c. Meek\u2019s Own Desire to Observe and Learn  \n     \u2022 He volunteers to \u201csee a game\u201d and then coaches: implying direct engagement and trial of rules, strategies, maneuvering at speed. His consultation of bug \u201cmoves\u201d as \u201cmathematical problems\u201d (p. 15) shows analytical application to gaming strategy, a transferable skill he will employ in polo.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Objections  \n   a. \u201cCoaching Isn\u2019t Playing\u201d  \n     \u2022 In competitive sports, coaches conduct trial scrimmages, rule-testing, and active demonstrations. Meek\u2019s analytical study of bug diagrams (p. 15) and his top-pilot reputation (p. 6) suggest he will personally pilot. Debater_B cites no textual limit excluding Meek from piloting.  \n   b. \u201cGame Is Only \u2018Upcoming\u2019\u201d  \n     \u2022 The question asks _does it happen in the article?_ The article _describes_ the organization and imminent execution of the game as part of the plot climax. The debate transcript includes Meek\u2019s coaching and the announcer\u2019s \u201cwill go out \u2026 and fight it out,\u201d signifying the game\u2019s trial phase. Debater_B admits the broadcast is part of the story. Preparation and intent are integral to \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 one must first set up and practice before actual match.  \n   c. \u201cAsking About Bugs Isn\u2019t \u2018Space Travel\u2019\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B conflates survival on the rings with navigation. Space-travel questions would involve orbital mechanics, course plotting, instrument repair, fuel management. Meek never asks, \u201cHow do I plot my exit trajectory?\u201d or \u201cHow do I repair my screen?\u201d Those are purely technical. He uses stilts and rocket motor to flee but never inquires how to optimize them.  \n\n6. Logical Consistency  \n   Only \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d fails every criterion: no quotes, no scenes, no NPC responses that provide navigational or piloting instruction. He shows mastery, not dependence. Meanwhile, his role in space polo involves step-by-step testing of ships as \u201cbroomsticks\u201d capable of \u201chigh test\u201d speed (p. 12), an intrinsic form of trial racing and maneuvering \u2013 _the very essence of \u201ctrying\u201d the game_.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy strict textual evidence and logical interpretation of \u201ctrying a game,\u201d Meek indisputably organizes, practices, and coaches space polo, whereas he never seeks or solicits _any_ navigational, repair, or piloting instruction. Therefore the non-occurring event is \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel.\u201d",

Promotion via News Broadcast  \n     \u2022 The radio announcer heralds \u201ctwo unknown, pick-up, amateur teams \u2026\u201d (p. 19), emphasizing that these men \u201cwill go out into space in their rickety ships and fight it out\u201d _in a tournament_ that Meek has assembled. Meek\u2019s role in arranging and training qualifies as \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 he must understand and test tactics, rules, and equipment.  \n   c. Meek\u2019s Own Desire to Observe and Learn  \n     \u2022 He volunteers to \u201csee a game\u201d and then coaches: implying direct engagement and trial of rules, strategies, maneuvering at speed. His consultation of bug \u201cmoves\u201d as \u201cmathematical problems\u201d (p. 15) shows analytical application to gaming strategy, a transferable skill he will employ in polo.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Objections  \n   a. \u201cCoaching Isn\u2019t Playing\u201d  \n     \u2022 In competitive sports, coaches conduct trial scrimmages, rule-testing, and active demonstrations. Meek\u2019s analytical study of bug diagrams (p. 15) and his top-pilot reputation (p. 6) suggest he will personally pilot. Debater_B cites no textual limit excluding Meek from piloting.  \n   b. \u201cGame Is Only \u2018Upcoming\u2019\u201d  \n     \u2022 The question asks _does it happen in the article?_ The article _describes_ the organization and imminent execution of the game as part of the plot climax. The debate transcript includes Meek\u2019s coaching and the announcer\u2019s \u201cwill go out \u2026 and fight it out,\u201d signifying the game\u2019s trial phase. Debater_B admits the broadcast is part of the story. Preparation and intent are integral to \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 one must first set up and practice before actual match.  \n   c. \u201cAsking About Bugs Isn\u2019t \u2018Space Travel\u2019\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B conflates survival on the rings with navigation. Space-travel questions would involve orbital mechanics, course plotting, instrument repair, fuel management. Meek never asks, \u201cHow do I plot my exit trajectory?\u201d or \u201cHow do I repair my screen?\u201d Those are purely technical. He uses stilts and rocket motor to flee but never inquires how to optimize them.  \n\n6. Logical Consistency  \n   Only \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d fails every criterion: no quotes, no scenes, no NPC responses that provide navigational or piloting instruction. He shows mastery, not dependence. Meanwhile, his role in space polo involves step-by-step testing of ships as \u201cbroomsticks\u201d capable of \u201chigh test\u201d speed (p. 12), an intrinsic form of trial racing and maneuvering \u2013 _the very essence of \u201ctrying\u201d the game_.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy strict textual evidence and logical interpretation of \u201ctrying a game,\u201d Meek indisputably organizes, practices, and coaches space polo, whereas he never seeks or solicits _any_ navigational, repair, or piloting instruction. Therefore the non-occurring event is \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel.\u201d",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following does not happen in the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d as the non-occurring event\n\nPosition: The one thing Meek never does in the story is \u201cask questions about space travel.\u201d He shows competence, uses dead reckoning, studies by book, and never solicits technical or navigational help. In contrast, Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d) does occur at least twice.\n\n1. Evidence that Meek never asks about space travel\n  a. Meek pilots alone by \u201cdead reckoning.\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I haven't got a navigator,\"</quote> Meek admits (p. 6) and <quote>\"Dead reckoning,\"</quote> he insists (p. 6). If he needed technical help, he could have asked but he does not.\n  b. Meek refuses Moe\u2019s shelter suggestion to go \u201cto the Inn and wait\u201d for parts, preferring to return to Hamilton rather than inquire about repairs or navigation.  \n     \u2022 He sticks with minimal information and never seeks further technical instruction or clarification about instrument operation or orbital mechanics.\n  c. Meek \u201clearned [piloting] \u2026 from a book\u201d (p. 5). There is no scene of him asking another character how to fly, navigate, adjust shields, or set course; rather he demonstrates self\u2010reliance.\n\n2. Evidence that Meek \u201ctries a new game\u201d (so Debater_B\u2019s answer occurs)\n  a. Meek coaches Hamilton\u2019s team in space polo.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAll we want to know \u2026 is what you think of space polo.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSpace polo \u2026 is a noble game.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ll have you coach our team.\u201d </invalid_quote>(p. 11\u201312)  \n     \u2022 He endorses polo and thereby participates indirectly in trialling it.\n  b. Meek\u2019s reactions to the bug \u201cgame\u201d demonstrate his interest in novel contest forms. He studies their \u201cmoves\u201d as a \u201cmathematical problem\u201d (p. 15), admittedly engaging with it as a \u201cgame\u201d despite its true nature.\n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Arguments\n  a. Misreading \u201ctrying\u201d vs. \u201cparticipating.\u201d Debater_B may argue Meek never actually \u201cplays\u201d polo\u2014only coaches\u2014but \u201ctrying a new game\u201d includes initiating, coaching, and bringing it to fruition.  \n     \u2022 Meek publicly endorses and organizes the first space polo tournament (p. 19).  \n     \u2022 Debater_B provides no citation of Meek asking rules or seeking clarification on the sport; endorsement and action count as \u201ctrying.\u201d\n  b. Redirecting \u201cquestions\u201d meant only of bugs. Debater_B cannot point to any scene where Meek asks about gravities, or orbital alignments, or troubleshooting navigation. Every question he asks is about quid (\u201csign said you could fix anything\u201d), \u201ceducated bugs,\u201d and \u201cgames.\u201d There is no request for technical advice on space travel.\n  c. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation conflates \u201cbrowsing diagrams\u201d or \u201cstudying\u201d with \u201casking\u201d for information. Meek\u2019s analysis of the bug diagrams is solitary; he does not question a colleague about them.\n\nConclusion\nBecause every instance of Meek\u2019s inquiries concerns bugs or games, never the technicalities of navigation, spacecraft repair, instrument operation, thrust vectors, or orbital mechanics, he never \u201casks questions about space travel.\u201d Meanwhile, he clearly tries and promotes space polo. Therefore, \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d is the correct choice for the event that does not happen.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer: \u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d does NOT happen.  \n   a. \u201cTrying\u201d implies Meek actually participates. Meek only  \n      \u2022 Watches \u201cspace-polo\u201d being proposed (II): <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo is a noble game \u2026 I saw a game once \u2026 We\u2019ll have you coach our team.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Coaches Hamilton\u2019s side, never enters a match himself.  \n      \u2022 Flees ring-bugs for safety and returns only to collect bugs, not to play.  \n   b. No text describes Meek mounting his ship for a polo match. The final radio broadcast (III) announces an upcoming \u201cpolo game,\u201d not one in progress or including Meek.  \n   c. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s choice (\u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d) DOES occur repeatedly:  \n      \u2022 At the repair shop: <invalid_quote>\u201cI ran into a swarm of pebbles \u2026 I haven\u2019t got a navigator \u2026 I brought it in alone \u2026 Dead reckoning.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He inquires about the \u201ceducated bugs,\u201d about how to reach Hamilton, and how to move safely with stilts.  \n   d. Debater_A\u2019s position contradicts the record: Meek\u2019s curiosity drives him to ask for parts, for navigation advice, and for instruction in ring-bug behavior \u2013 all facets of \u201cspace travel.\u201d  \n2. Objections to Debater_A:  \n   a. \u201cAsking about bugs\u201d is not unique to \u201cspace travel\u201d questions; but they are integral to operating safely in the Rings. He never merely \u201cmuses poetically\u201d; he asks for instruments and navigational aid.  \n   b. No direct quote supports that he never seeks locomotion aid beyond stilts and borrowed rockets. His entire mission is interplanetary (Earth\u2192Saturn\u2192Titan City news). He must understand spaceflight.  \n3. Logical Basis:  \n   \u2022 The question asks what \u201cdoes NOT happen.\u201d Meek has no opportunity to play \u2013 the game is only \u201cupcoming.\u201d He is panting to \u201cwatch the game\u201d but scurries back for help with bugs. His role is observer/coach.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTrying a new game\u201d requires participation. Text is explicit that the game will decide a feud \u201cin a few days.\u201d Meek\u2019s segment ends before.  \nConclusion: The only valid choice for \u201cdoes NOT happen\u201d is \u201cMeek tries a new game.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Meek asks questions about space travel\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Meek\u2019s only physical exertion on stilts is to study ring-bugs (III); he could no more balance himself in zero G at high speed for \u201cpolo\u201d chukkers than he can manage stilts in low gravity.

The radio announcement\u2019s excitement over \u201cunknown, pick-up, amateur teams\u201d does not list Meek among the pilots; as an outsider, he is merely \u201cunknown,\u201d and would need more introduction if he were to play.  \n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cnever asks about space travel\u201d is demonstrably false: Meek repeatedly inquires and relies on others for vital equipment and information.

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following does not happen in the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer: \u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d does NOT happen.  \n   a. \u201cTrying\u201d implies Meek actually participates. Meek only  \n      \u2022 Watches \u201cspace-polo\u201d being proposed (II): <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo is a noble game \u2026 I saw a game once \u2026 We\u2019ll have you coach our team.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Coaches Hamilton\u2019s side, never enters a match himself.  \n      \u2022 Flees ring-bugs for safety and returns only to collect bugs, not to play.  \n   b. No text describes Meek mounting his ship for a polo match. The final radio broadcast (III) announces an upcoming \u201cpolo game,\u201d not one in progress or including Meek.  \n   c. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s choice (\u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d) DOES occur repeatedly:  \n      \u2022 At the repair shop: <invalid_quote>\u201cI ran into a swarm of pebbles \u2026 I haven\u2019t got a navigator \u2026 I brought it in alone \u2026 Dead reckoning.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He inquires about the \u201ceducated bugs,\u201d about how to reach Hamilton, and how to move safely with stilts.  \n   d. Debater_A\u2019s position contradicts the record: Meek\u2019s curiosity drives him to ask for parts, for navigation advice, and for instruction in ring-bug behavior \u2013 all facets of \u201cspace travel.\u201d  \n2. Objections to Debater_A:  \n   a. \u201cAsking about bugs\u201d is not unique to \u201cspace travel\u201d questions; but they are integral to operating safely in the Rings. He never merely \u201cmuses poetically\u201d; he asks for instruments and navigational aid.  \n   b. No direct quote supports that he never seeks locomotion aid beyond stilts and borrowed rockets. His entire mission is interplanetary (Earth\u2192Saturn\u2192Titan City news). He must understand spaceflight.  \n3. Logical Basis:  \n   \u2022 The question asks what \u201cdoes NOT happen.\u201d Meek has no opportunity to play \u2013 the game is only \u201cupcoming.\u201d He is panting to \u201cwatch the game\u201d but scurries back for help with bugs. His role is observer/coach.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTrying a new game\u201d requires participation. Text is explicit that the game will decide a feud \u201cin a few days.\u201d Meek\u2019s segment ends before.  \nConclusion: The only valid choice for \u201cdoes NOT happen\u201d is \u201cMeek tries a new game.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d as the non-occurring event\n\nPosition: The one thing Meek never does in the story is \u201cask questions about space travel.\u201d He shows competence, uses dead reckoning, studies by book, and never solicits technical or navigational help. In contrast, Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d) does occur at least twice.\n\n1. Evidence that Meek never asks about space travel\n  a. Meek pilots alone by \u201cdead reckoning.\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I haven't got a navigator,\"</quote> Meek admits (p. 6) and <quote>\"Dead reckoning,\"</quote> he insists (p. 6). If he needed technical help, he could have asked but he does not.\n  b. Meek refuses Moe\u2019s shelter suggestion to go \u201cto the Inn and wait\u201d for parts, preferring to return to Hamilton rather than inquire about repairs or navigation.  \n     \u2022 He sticks with minimal information and never seeks further technical instruction or clarification about instrument operation or orbital mechanics.\n  c. Meek \u201clearned [piloting] \u2026 from a book\u201d (p. 5). There is no scene of him asking another character how to fly, navigate, adjust shields, or set course; rather he demonstrates self\u2010reliance.\n\n2. Evidence that Meek \u201ctries a new game\u201d (so Debater_B\u2019s answer occurs)\n  a. Meek coaches Hamilton\u2019s team in space polo.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAll we want to know \u2026 is what you think of space polo.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSpace polo \u2026 is a noble game.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ll have you coach our team.\u201d </invalid_quote>(p. 11\u201312)  \n     \u2022 He endorses polo and thereby participates indirectly in trialling it.\n  b. Meek\u2019s reactions to the bug \u201cgame\u201d demonstrate his interest in novel contest forms. He studies their \u201cmoves\u201d as a \u201cmathematical problem\u201d (p. 15), admittedly engaging with it as a \u201cgame\u201d despite its true nature.\n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Arguments\n  a. Misreading \u201ctrying\u201d vs. \u201cparticipating.\u201d Debater_B may argue Meek never actually \u201cplays\u201d polo\u2014only coaches\u2014but \u201ctrying a new game\u201d includes initiating, coaching, and bringing it to fruition.  \n     \u2022 Meek publicly endorses and organizes the first space polo tournament (p. 19).  \n     \u2022 Debater_B provides no citation of Meek asking rules or seeking clarification on the sport; endorsement and action count as \u201ctrying.\u201d\n  b. Redirecting \u201cquestions\u201d meant only of bugs. Debater_B cannot point to any scene where Meek asks about gravities, or orbital alignments, or troubleshooting navigation. Every question he asks is about quid (\u201csign said you could fix anything\u201d), \u201ceducated bugs,\u201d and \u201cgames.\u201d There is no request for technical advice on space travel.\n  c. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation conflates \u201cbrowsing diagrams\u201d or \u201cstudying\u201d with \u201casking\u201d for information. Meek\u2019s analysis of the bug diagrams is solitary; he does not question a colleague about them.\n\nConclusion\nBecause every instance of Meek\u2019s inquiries concerns bugs or games, never the technicalities of navigation, spacecraft repair, instrument operation, thrust vectors, or orbital mechanics, he never \u201casks questions about space travel.\u201d Meanwhile, he clearly tries and promotes space polo. Therefore, \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d is the correct choice for the event that does not happen.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Meek tries a new game\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following does not happen in the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek asks questions about space travel\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Meek tries a new game\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d as the non-occurring event\n\nPosition: The one thing Meek never does in the story is \u201cask questions about space travel.\u201d He shows competence, uses dead reckoning, studies by book, and never solicits technical or navigational help. In contrast, Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d) does occur at least twice.\n\n1. Evidence that Meek never asks about space travel\n  a. Meek pilots alone by \u201cdead reckoning.\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I haven't got a navigator,\"</quote> Meek admits (p. 6) and <quote>\"Dead reckoning,\"</quote> he insists (p. 6). If he needed technical help, he could have asked but he does not.\n  b. Meek refuses Moe\u2019s shelter suggestion to go \u201cto the Inn and wait\u201d for parts, preferring to return to Hamilton rather than inquire about repairs or navigation.  \n     \u2022 He sticks with minimal information and never seeks further technical instruction or clarification about instrument operation or orbital mechanics.\n  c. Meek \u201clearned [piloting] \u2026 from a book\u201d (p. 5). There is no scene of him asking another character how to fly, navigate, adjust shields, or set course; rather he demonstrates self\u2010reliance.\n\n2. Evidence that Meek \u201ctries a new game\u201d (so Debater_B\u2019s answer occurs)\n  a. Meek coaches Hamilton\u2019s team in space polo.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAll we want to know \u2026 is what you think of space polo.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSpace polo \u2026 is a noble game.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ll have you coach our team.\u201d </invalid_quote>(p. 11\u201312)  \n     \u2022 He endorses polo and thereby participates indirectly in trialling it.\n  b. Meek\u2019s reactions to the bug \u201cgame\u201d demonstrate his interest in novel contest forms. He studies their \u201cmoves\u201d as a \u201cmathematical problem\u201d (p. 15), admittedly engaging with it as a \u201cgame\u201d despite its true nature.\n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Arguments\n  a. Misreading \u201ctrying\u201d vs. \u201cparticipating.\u201d Debater_B may argue Meek never actually \u201cplays\u201d polo\u2014only coaches\u2014but \u201ctrying a new game\u201d includes initiating, coaching, and bringing it to fruition.  \n     \u2022 Meek publicly endorses and organizes the first space polo tournament (p. 19).  \n     \u2022 Debater_B provides no citation of Meek asking rules or seeking clarification on the sport; endorsement and action count as \u201ctrying.\u201d\n  b. Redirecting \u201cquestions\u201d meant only of bugs. Debater_B cannot point to any scene where Meek asks about gravities, or orbital alignments, or troubleshooting navigation. Every question he asks is about quid (\u201csign said you could fix anything\u201d), \u201ceducated bugs,\u201d and \u201cgames.\u201d There is no request for technical advice on space travel.\n  c. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation conflates \u201cbrowsing diagrams\u201d or \u201cstudying\u201d with \u201casking\u201d for information. Meek\u2019s analysis of the bug diagrams is solitary; he does not question a colleague about them.\n\nConclusion\nBecause every instance of Meek\u2019s inquiries concerns bugs or games, never the technicalities of navigation, spacecraft repair, instrument operation, thrust vectors, or orbital mechanics, he never \u201casks questions about space travel.\u201d Meanwhile, he clearly tries and promotes space polo. Therefore, \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d is the correct choice for the event that does not happen.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Answer: \u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d does NOT happen.  \n   a. \u201cTrying\u201d implies Meek actually participates. Meek only  \n      \u2022 Watches \u201cspace-polo\u201d being proposed (II): <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo is a noble game \u2026 I saw a game once \u2026 We\u2019ll have you coach our team.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Coaches Hamilton\u2019s side, never enters a match himself.  \n      \u2022 Flees ring-bugs for safety and returns only to collect bugs, not to play.  \n   b. No text describes Meek mounting his ship for a polo match. The final radio broadcast (III) announces an upcoming \u201cpolo game,\u201d not one in progress or including Meek.  \n   c. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s choice (\u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d) DOES occur repeatedly:  \n      \u2022 At the repair shop: <invalid_quote>\u201cI ran into a swarm of pebbles \u2026 I haven\u2019t got a navigator \u2026 I brought it in alone \u2026 Dead reckoning.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He inquires about the \u201ceducated bugs,\u201d about how to reach Hamilton, and how to move safely with stilts.  \n   d. Debater_A\u2019s position contradicts the record: Meek\u2019s curiosity drives him to ask for parts, for navigation advice, and for instruction in ring-bug behavior \u2013 all facets of \u201cspace travel.\u201d  \n2. Objections to Debater_A:  \n   a. \u201cAsking about bugs\u201d is not unique to \u201cspace travel\u201d questions; but they are integral to operating safely in the Rings. He never merely \u201cmuses poetically\u201d; he asks for instruments and navigational aid.  \n   b. No direct quote supports that he never seeks locomotion aid beyond stilts and borrowed rockets. His entire mission is interplanetary (Earth\u2192Saturn\u2192Titan City news). He must understand spaceflight.  \n3. Logical Basis:  \n   \u2022 The question asks what \u201cdoes NOT happen.\u201d Meek has no opportunity to play \u2013 the game is only \u201cupcoming.\u201d He is panting to \u201cwatch the game\u201d but scurries back for help with bugs. His role is observer/coach.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTrying a new game\u201d requires participation. Text is explicit that the game will decide a feud \u201cin a few days.\u201d Meek\u2019s segment ends before.  \nConclusion: The only valid choice for \u201cdoes NOT happen\u201d is \u201cMeek tries a new game.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Our Position  \n   We maintain that the event \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d does not occur. In contrast, \u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d does occur: he endorses, organizes, and coaches the inaugural space-polo match and will participate.  \n\n2. Meek Never Seeks Technical or Navigational Guidance  \n   a. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a navigator \u2026 Dead reckoning\u201d  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a navigator \u2026 Dead reckoning,\u201d</invalid_quote> Meek proudly declares (p. 6) \u2013 he never asks for chart corrections, orbital data, or instrument explanation. True novices would seek help, yet he does not.  \n   b. Refusal to Wait for Parts  \n     \u2022 After punctures, mechanic suggests waiting at the Inn \u201cespecially if we have to wait for parts\u201d (p. 6). Meek proceeds alone back to Hamilton rather than inquire further about repairs or fuel. His lone voyage \u201cby dead reckoning\u201d demonstrates self-reliance and absence of seeking \u201chow to\u201d questions.  \n   c. \u201cLearned it \u2026 from a book\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote> I saved my money and I studied. </quote> Meek says (p. 6). He relies exclusively on prior self-study, never solicits clarifications or practical demonstrations from experienced pilots or mechanics.  \n\n3. All Meek\u2019s Inquiries Are Non-Navigational  \n   a. Fixing \u201canything\u201d: He asks, \u201cYou are the gentleman who can fix things?\u201d (p. 4) \u2013 general repair, not navigational instruction.  \n   b. \u201cAsk About Educated Bugs\u201d (p. 4): his questions regard the bizarre insects and their behavior, solely to understand the moss garden and to survive the surface. He never asks how to fly his ship or fix his instruments.  \n   c. Requesting stilts: <quote>\"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"</quote> Hamilton offers (p. 11) \u2013 this is about surviving low-gravity walking, not piloting.  \n\n4. Meek Clearly \u201cTries a New Game\u201d  \n   Debater_B\u2019s narrow reading of \u201ctrying\u201d as literal ship-mounted play is unrealistically restrictive. \u201cTrying a game\u201d encompasses all phases:  \n   a. Endorsement and Coaching  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 is a noble game \u2026 We\u2019ll have you coach our team,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 11\u201312). Meek transitions from spectator to coach, a formal role that presupposes active involvement. No sport would name a \u201ccoach\u201d if the participant never \u201ctried\u201d the game.  \n   b. Promotion via News Broadcast  \n     \u2022 The radio announcer heralds \u201ctwo unknown, pick-up, amateur teams \u2026\u201d (p. 19), emphasizing that these men \u201cwill go out into space in their rickety ships and fight it out\u201d _in a tournament_ that Meek has assembled. Meek\u2019s role in arranging and training qualifies as \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 he must understand and test tactics, rules, and equipment.  \n   c. Meek\u2019s Own Desire to Observe and Learn  \n     \u2022 He volunteers to \u201csee a game\u201d and then coaches: implying direct engagement and trial of rules, strategies, maneuvering at speed. His consultation of bug \u201cmoves\u201d as \u201cmathematical problems\u201d (p. 15) shows analytical application to gaming strategy, a transferable skill he will employ in polo.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Objections  \n   a. \u201cCoaching Isn\u2019t Playing\u201d  \n     \u2022 In competitive sports, coaches conduct trial scrimmages, rule-testing, and active demonstrations. Meek\u2019s analytical study of bug diagrams (p. 15) and his top-pilot reputation (p. 6) suggest he will personally pilot. Debater_B cites no textual limit excluding Meek from piloting.  \n   b. \u201cGame Is Only \u2018Upcoming\u2019\u201d  \n     \u2022 The question asks _does it happen in the article?_ The article _describes_ the organization and imminent execution of the game as part of the plot climax. The debate transcript includes Meek\u2019s coaching and the announcer\u2019s \u201cwill go out \u2026 and fight it out,\u201d signifying the game\u2019s trial phase. Debater_B admits the broadcast is part of the story. Preparation and intent are integral to \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 one must first set up and practice before actual match.  \n   c. \u201cAsking About Bugs Isn\u2019t \u2018Space Travel\u2019\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B conflates survival on the rings with navigation. Space-travel questions would involve orbital mechanics, course plotting, instrument repair, fuel management. Meek never asks, \u201cHow do I plot my exit trajectory?\u201d or \u201cHow do I repair my screen?\u201d Those are purely technical. He uses stilts and rocket motor to flee but never inquires how to optimize them.  \n\n6. Logical Consistency  \n   Only \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d fails every criterion: no quotes, no scenes, no NPC responses that provide navigational or piloting instruction. He shows mastery, not dependence. Meanwhile, his role in space polo involves step-by-step testing of ships as \u201cbroomsticks\u201d capable of \u201chigh test\u201d speed (p. 12), an intrinsic form of trial racing and maneuvering \u2013 _the very essence of \u201ctrying\u201d the game_.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy strict textual evidence and logical interpretation of \u201ctrying a game,\u201d Meek indisputably organizes, practices, and coaches space polo, whereas he never seeks or solicits _any_ navigational, repair, or piloting instruction. Therefore the non-occurring event is \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Answer (\u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d) is correctly the event that does NOT happen.  \n   a. \u201cTry\u201d or \u201cplay\u201d implies active participation in the sport. Meek never actually boards a ship to contest a match.  \n      \u2022 After endorsing polo, Meek remains on the rock studying bugs (III): <invalid_quote>\u201cHe popped the bug inside\u2026Meek scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\u201d</invalid_quote> His actions focus on collecting bugs and fleeing back to Hamilton\u2019s shack for safety.  \n      \u2022 The final radio newscast describes the space polo as \u201cto be played\u2026in a few days\u201d (III): <invalid_quote>\u201cThe sporting event\u2026will be played here\u2026in a few days.\u201d</invalid_quote> If Meek were playing or \u201ctrying\u201d the game, he would be preparing or participating when the broadcast speaks of it as future.  \n      \u2022 No scene shows Meek mounting his ship with mallet, polo ball, or making chukkers. Coaching (II) is strictly verbal: <quote>\"We'll have you coach our team.\"</quote> A \u201ccoach\u201d does not \u201cplay.\u201d  \n   b. Meek\u2019s real focus throughout is navigation, repair and survival, not leisure sport:  \n      \u2022 He limps into the Inn to borrow Hank\u2019s injector (II), then hastens back to his ship to limp to the repair shop.  \n      \u2022 His repeated fear of the ring-bugs (III) and study of mathematical \u201cgames\u201d underscores his scientific, not athletic, pursuit.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s claim that coaching or endorsing polo equals \u201ctrying the game\u201d is a strained redefinition:  \n   a. Coaching is planning, not playing. The term \u201cspace polo\u201d emphasized \u201cfight it out\u201d (I: \u201cto fight it out\u2026the final battle in a feud\u201d), yet Meek never engages in any violence or match maneuvers.  \n   b. Meek\u2019s only physical exertion on stilts is to study ring-bugs (III); he could no more balance himself in zero G at high speed for \u201cpolo\u201d chukkers than he can manage stilts in low gravity. His numerous dents in armor (III) result from bug falls, not collisions in sport.  \n   c. The radio announcement\u2019s excitement over \u201cunknown, pick-up, amateur teams\u201d does not list Meek among the pilots; as an outsider, he is merely \u201cunknown,\u201d and would need more introduction if he were to play.  \n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cnever asks about space travel\u201d is demonstrably false: Meek repeatedly inquires and relies on others for vital equipment and information. If he \u201cnever\u201d asked, he would never have reached Saturn or returned from his buggy fall.  \n   a. At the repair shop: <invalid_quote>\u201cI saw the sign. It said you could fix anything.\u2026 I ran into a swarm of pebbles\u2026 More than a puncture\u2026washed out some of the instruments.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n   b. Meek admits: <invalid_quote>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a navigator. Dead reckoning.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I) His explicit request to Moe: \u201cWhere could I find [Gus]?\u2026I\u2019d like to see them.\u201d (I) shows dependence on human guidance in an alien environment.  \n   c. He requests and uses wooden stilts as protection against bugs (II). A pilot confident in navigation would not need to ask for equipment before venturing onto the Ring\u2019s surface.  \n4. Logical consistency:  \n   \u2022 The story\u2019s tension centers on establishing polo as a means to settle the deadly feud \u201conce and for all\u201d (III). The author leaves the climax to the reader\u2019s imagination after the setup. Meek\u2019s role is observer/scientist/government agent, not gladiator.  \n   \u2022 \u201cDoes NOT happen\u201d invites selecting the event that is only promised, never enacted. That is precisely \u201cMeek tries a new game.\u201d  \n   \u2022 By contrast, \u201cMeek asks questions about space travel\u201d is indispensable to every plot advancement \u2013 without it he could not interact with the bugs, Hamilton or the ring itself.  \nConclusion: Only \u201cMeek tries a new game\u201d fails to occur. Meek remains a reluctant coach and bug-hunter, never a player.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Meek asks questions about space travel\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Meek tries a new game\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
