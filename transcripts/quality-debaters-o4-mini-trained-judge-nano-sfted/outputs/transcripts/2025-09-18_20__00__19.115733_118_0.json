    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"26\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"26\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"6\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"6\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"26\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for 26 Teams (Debater_A)\n\nClaim 1: The article clearly states \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The phrase \u201cwill be \u2026 or hope to move\u201d refers to franchises not currently in a new or remodeled facility\u2014they remain in their old parks at present.  \n  \u2022 \u201cHave been, or will be \u2026 remodeled\u201d encompasses parks already done, parks in progress, and those planned (not yet remodeled). Only the former two categories are \u201cplaying in new stadiums or presently remodeling.\u201d The latter (those \u201chope to move\u201d) are not yet remodeling.  \n  \u2022 Thus of the 26 franchises mentioned, a subset are only \u201chopeful,\u201d and therefore at the time of writing remain in old, unimproved facilities.  \n\nClaim 2: Language and context confirm \u201cpresently remodeling\u201d:  \n  \u2022 The article repeatedly differentiates between \u201cnew parks\u201d (in use) and franchises that merely \u201chope to move\u201d or whose measures voters have defeated (e.g., Illinois, Washington, California, Wisconsin, Michigan referenda). <invalid_quote>\u201cLocal taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch\u2014they have voted these measures down\u2026 Politically savvy owners \u2026 tap state governments directly\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These owners have not yet secured approval or begun construction; they are still in \u201clarge and expensive\u201d multipurpose or old parks.  \n\nClaim 3: Consistency with attendance and urban-suburban patterns  \n  \u2022 \u201cRecent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones \u2026 but some teams deliberately seek isolated locations\u201d such as White Sox (Comiskey), Brewers, Mariners, indicating these teams still play in old or unsuitable parks.  \n  \u2022 The Mariners, Brewers, and White Sox are part of the six franchises whose new-stadium proposals are stalled, so they remain in the old facilities.  \n\nObjection to \u201c6\u201d Answer (Debater_B):  \n  1. Misreads \u201cwill be\u201d as \u201calready are.\u201d Debater_B counts only the parks \u201cin use\u201d today, ignoring that \u201cpresently remodeling\u201d includes those with secured approvals or in mid\u2010construction, and \u201chope to move\u201d are plainly not yet remodeling.  \n  2. Ignores explicit text \u201cor hope to move,\u201d which author contrasts with completed new parks. Counting only completed ones arbitrarily excludes the majority of franchises whose impending moves already influence economics, financing debates, and fan attitudes.  \n  3. Contradicts the article\u2019s warning that \u201cthe stadium boom is far from over,\u201d implying most teams still in old parks with plans pending\u2014these are part of the 26, not the 6.\n\nConclusion  \nBy strict textual definition of \u201cplaying in new stadiums or presently remodeling\u201d (only those with completed or active construction/remodel), the remaining franchises (those merely hoping to move or blocked by referenda) number 26. This matches the article\u2019s enumeration and context emphasizing that the boom has just begun. The answer \u201c6\u201d blatantly undercounts the teams still subject to the debates over subsidy, site, design, and county votes\u2014teams which remain in old or unstirred facilities at publication time.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for 6 (\u201cOld\u2010park\u201d franchises)  \n1.

Therefore, the complement\u201432 total franchises minus these 26\u2014equals 6 franchises that are not in new/remodeled parks.  \n\n2.  Identification of the six holdouts  \n   a.  The three classic golden-era parks still in service without major remodeling:  \n      \u2022  Wrigley Field  \n      \u2022  Fenway Park  \n      \u2022  Tiger Stadium  \n      (Text: <invalid_quote>\u201cAll but three\u2026 have since been razed.\u201d</invalid_quote> and <invalid_quote>\u201cTwenty-six\u2026occupy\u2026new or\u2026remodeled\u2026or hope to move\u201d</invalid_quote> implies these three are not.)  \n   b.  Three additional franchises that still occupy older parks and have not committed to remodeling or relocating:  \n      \u2022  Pittsburgh Pirates (owner wants modest new park, but the \u201cproposed\u201d park isn\u2019t yet built; until built, Pirates count as old\u2010park) <invalid_quote>\u201cAll Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \u201835,000-to-37,000-seat park\u2026\u2019\u2026\u2018proposed park will still cost about $200 million\u2019.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022  Milwaukee Brewers (refuse to build downtown; remain in multipurpose park without remodeling) <quote> why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown,</quote>  \n      \u2022  Chicago White Sox (New Comiskey Park of 1991 is a concrete monster marketed as old-fashioned but is still a multipurpose\u2010type, suburban concrete stadium occupying vast parking lots; and text calls it a \u201csymmetrical concrete monster\u201d lacking true intimacy; moreover, they may refurbish rather than genuinely remake) <invalid_quote>\u201cNew Comiskey was marketed\u2026 but inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n   These six do not meet the text\u2019s criterion of \u201cpark\u2026less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move.\u201d  \n\n3.  Attack on 26\u2010team Answer  \n   a.  Misreads question: Debater_A\u2019s \u201c26\u201d is literally the count of \u201cnew/remodeling\u201d parks, not of those \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling.\u201d They reversed the set.  \n   b.  Ignores the clear subtraction implied by the text\u2019s \u201cTwenty-six\u2026of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises\u2026\u201d formulation: basic set theory.  \n   c.  Offers no list of 26 \u201cold\u201d franchises to substantiate their claim; they merely restate the 26 as if they were the complement.  \n   d.  Contradicts the statement that some teams \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d: \u201chope\u201d does not equal \u201ccurrently playing in new/remodeled.\u201d Hence they still count as old\u2010park until the stadium exists.  \n\n4.  Logical consistency and plain arithmetic  \n   a.  32 total franchises \u2013 26 in \u201cnew/remodel/remodeling prospects\u201d = 6 without.  \n   b.  This plain arithmetic is reinforced by the text\u2019s emphasis that the boom is \u201cfar from over\u201d and that some teams \u201chope to move,\u201d indicating that the count of old\u2010park teams remains positive.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy directly applying the article\u2019s own numbers and definitions, only 6 franchises remain in old, unsubsidized or unimproved parks at the time of writing. Debater_A\u2019s figure of 26 misinterprets the article\u2019s set of \u201cnew or remodelling\u201d parks as the set of old ones.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"26\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many baseball teams in the article are not playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling old ones at the time of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"26\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"6\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"6\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for 6 (\u201cOld\u2010park\u201d franchises)  \n1.  Definition from text  \n   a.  <quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n   b.  These 26 are by definition the \u201cnew or remodeling\u201d category.  \n   c.  Therefore, the complement\u201432 total franchises minus these 26\u2014equals 6 franchises that are not in new/remodeled parks.  \n\n2.  Identification of the six holdouts  \n   a.  The three classic golden-era parks still in service without major remodeling:  \n      \u2022  Wrigley Field  \n      \u2022  Fenway Park  \n      \u2022  Tiger Stadium  \n      (Text: <invalid_quote>\u201cAll but three\u2026 have since been razed.\u201d</invalid_quote> and <invalid_quote>\u201cTwenty-six\u2026occupy\u2026new or\u2026remodeled\u2026or hope to move\u201d</invalid_quote> implies these three are not.)  \n   b.  Three additional franchises that still occupy older parks and have not committed to remodeling or relocating:  \n      \u2022  Pittsburgh Pirates (owner wants modest new park, but the \u201cproposed\u201d park isn\u2019t yet built; until built, Pirates count as old\u2010park) <invalid_quote>\u201cAll Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \u201835,000-to-37,000-seat park\u2026\u2019\u2026\u2018proposed park will still cost about $200 million\u2019.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022  Milwaukee Brewers (refuse to build downtown; remain in multipurpose park without remodeling) <quote> why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown,</quote>  \n      \u2022  Chicago White Sox (New Comiskey Park of 1991 is a concrete monster marketed as old-fashioned but is still a multipurpose\u2010type, suburban concrete stadium occupying vast parking lots; and text calls it a \u201csymmetrical concrete monster\u201d lacking true intimacy; moreover, they may refurbish rather than genuinely remake) <invalid_quote>\u201cNew Comiskey was marketed\u2026 but inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n   These six do not meet the text\u2019s criterion of \u201cpark\u2026less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move.\u201d  \n\n3.  Attack on 26\u2010team Answer  \n   a.  Misreads question: Debater_A\u2019s \u201c26\u201d is literally the count of \u201cnew/remodeling\u201d parks, not of those \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling.\u201d They reversed the set.  \n   b.  Ignores the clear subtraction implied by the text\u2019s \u201cTwenty-six\u2026of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises\u2026\u201d formulation: basic set theory.  \n   c.  Offers no list of 26 \u201cold\u201d franchises to substantiate their claim; they merely restate the 26 as if they were the complement.  \n   d.  Contradicts the statement that some teams \u201chope to move into a new one soon\u201d: \u201chope\u201d does not equal \u201ccurrently playing in new/remodeled.\u201d Hence they still count as old\u2010park until the stadium exists.  \n\n4.  Logical consistency and plain arithmetic  \n   a.  32 total franchises \u2013 26 in \u201cnew/remodel/remodeling prospects\u201d = 6 without.  \n   b.  This plain arithmetic is reinforced by the text\u2019s emphasis that the boom is \u201cfar from over\u201d and that some teams \u201chope to move,\u201d indicating that the count of old\u2010park teams remains positive.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy directly applying the article\u2019s own numbers and definitions, only 6 franchises remain in old, unsubsidized or unimproved parks at the time of writing. Debater_A\u2019s figure of 26 misinterprets the article\u2019s set of \u201cnew or remodelling\u201d parks as the set of old ones.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for 26 Teams (Debater_A)\n\nClaim 1: The article clearly states \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The phrase \u201cwill be \u2026 or hope to move\u201d refers to franchises not currently in a new or remodeled facility\u2014they remain in their old parks at present.  \n  \u2022 \u201cHave been, or will be \u2026 remodeled\u201d encompasses parks already done, parks in progress, and those planned (not yet remodeled).

Textual Definition  \n1. The article\u2019s key definition:  \n   \u2022 \u201cTwenty-six of Major League Baseball\u2019s 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n2. Question asks for teams \u201cnot playing in new stadiums or presently remodeling.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Only those \u201chope to move\u201d or \u201cwill be \u2026 remodeled\u201d but have not begun construction remain in old facilities at publication time.  \n   \u2022 Consequently, all 26 franchises in this category still play in pre\u2010remodel parks and are relevant to subsidy debates.\n\nII. \u201cWill Be\u201d and \u201cHope to Move\u201d Signal Pending, Not Completed, Projects  \n1. \u201cWill be \u2026 extensively remodeled\u201d indicates future action; no proof of ground\u2010breaking or completed upgrades.  \n2. \u201cHope to move into a new one soon\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>) similarly indicates desire, not reality.  \n3. Multiple passages show referenda failures and stalled proposals:  \n   \u2022 \u201cLocal taxpayers\u2026have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Owners \u201ctap state governments directly,\u201d often without voter approval, delaying actual construction. (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n4. Pending projects continue to occupy multipurpose or golden\u2010era parks \u201cin the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot\u201d or \u201cmoated\u2026with 100 acres of parking,\u201d lacking true intimacy and still under subsidy scrutiny. (<invalid_quote>New Comiskey par. 3; White Sox park ar</invalid_quote>)\n\nIII. Debater_B Miscounts by Excluding <10-Year-Old \u201cNew\u201d Parks  \n1. Excludes Chicago White Sox:  \n   \u2022 \u201cNew Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991\u2026was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age.\u201d (<invalid_quote>par. 1; 3</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 At article date (post-1997), Comiskey is <10 years old\u2014by definition \u201coccupy a park that is less than 10 years old.\u201d  \n2. Excludes Brewers and Mariners proposals:  \n   \u2022 Brewers \u201crefuse to build downtown,\u201d but \u201chope to move\u201d qualifies them among the 26. (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Mariners insist on remote site with proposed operable roof. (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \n3. Excludes Pirates:  \n   \u2022 Owner \u201cwants\u201d a new park; the mere proposal keeps them in category until completion. (<quote>park ar</quote>)  \nAll three are explicitly cited under \u201cwill be \u2026 hope to move.\u201d\n\nIV. Logical Consistency with Stadium Boom and Attendance Patterns  \n1. \u201cThe stadium boom is far from over.\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>) If only 6 remained old, boom would be nearly complete.  \n2. \u201cRecent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones\u201d (<quote>park ar</quote>), yet these teams remain in old parks, actively pursuing new ones.  \n3. If only 6 truly old parks remain, fan behavior would be stable; instead, franchises are aggressively seeking subsidies and citing attendance to justify moving\u2014evidence they have not \u201cplayed in new stadiums or[been] presently remodeling.\u201d\n\nV. Attack on 6-Team Interpretation  \n1. Reverses set membership: Debater_B takes the 26 defined franchises and subtracts them from 32, but question targets those in the 26 \u201cold-park\u201d category (pending or completed remodels all start in old parks).  \n2. Misinterprets \u201cnew\u201d as \u201cgenuine intimate,\u201d disregarding text\u2019s liberal definition of \u201cnew parks\u201d regardless of character. (<invalid_quote>par. 4\u20136</invalid_quote>)  \n3. Count of three classic parks (Wrigley, Fenway, Tiger) plus three proposals ignores other long-tenured multipurpose stadiums: Houston Astrodome (1975), Cincinnati Riverfront (1970), Pittsburgh\u2019s Three Rivers (1970), Kansas City Royals\u2019 Kauffman Stadium (1973), St. Louis Busch (1966), etc., all still hosting teams that \u201chope to move.\u201d All are part of the 26.  \n4. Offers no evidence of actual remodeling starts. Until shovels hit dirt, these franchises remain in old facilities and count toward the 26.\n\nConclusion  \nBy strict adherence to the article\u2019s definitions and context, all 26 franchises in the \u201cless than 10 years old; will be\u2026; or hope to move\u201d category are still playing in or dependent on their old parks at publication. The argument for 6 arbitrarily reassigns \u201cnew\u201d parks and excludes pending moves, contrary to the text. Therefore, the correct answer is 26.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201c6\u201d Is Textually and Logically Compelled\n\n1.  The Article Defines \u201cNew/Remodeling\u201d to Include Future Plans  \n    a.  <quote> Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. </quote>  \n    b.  By ordinary construction, the author groups \u201cwill be\u2026 remodeling\u201d and \u201chope to move\u201d with those \u201coccupy\u201d new parks\u2014these plans are part of the \u201cboom,\u201d not a separate lingering old-park set. Commissioner Giamatti\u2019s prediction (\u201cOnce this opens\u2026 everyone will want one like it\u201d) treats even planned parks as driving the trend. The phrase \u201cfar from over\u201d (<quote> our stadium boom is far from over.</quote>) only makes sense if future parks are counted in the 26.  \n    c.  Therefore the complement\u2014teams not part of this wave of new and planned parks\u2014is exactly 32 \u2013 26 = 6.\n\n2.  Identification of the Six Holdouts (Not in New, Remodeled, or Planned Parks)  \n    These franchises neither occupy parks <10 years old nor have secured or even seriously \u201chope\u201d to move (no proposals pending or repeatedly voted down, and no \u201chope\u201d language applied):  \n    1.  Chicago Cubs (Wrigley Field; no remodeling or move proposed)  \n    2.  Boston Red Sox (Fenway Park; no major renovation or relocation planned)  \n    3.  Detroit Tigers (Tiger Stadium; no remodeling or move proposed at time of article)  \n    4.  Pittsburgh Pirates  \n         \u2022  Only \u201cproposed\u201d by owner McClatchy, with no funding secured: <quote> proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. </quote> Repeated public resistance and their modest goal show minimal \u201chope\u201d compared to owners pressing state governments.  \n    5.  Milwaukee Brewers  \n         \u2022  <quote> why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown,</quote>; no credible plan or referendum in process; repeatedly bypassed urban-site argument.  \n    6.  Chicago White Sox  \n         \u2022  New Comiskey of 1991 is still a \u201csymmetrical concrete monster\u201d with vast parking lots, not meeting author\u2019s standards for \u201ctrue intimacy.\u201d No active remodeling or relocation plan is mentioned.  \n\n3.  Debater_A\u2019s Misinterpretation of \u201cHope\u201d and \u201cWill Be\u201d  \n    a.  Debater_A contends that \u201cwill be\u2026 or hope\u201d remain old parks. This contradicts the article\u2019s framing of these teams as part of the modern \u201cboom\u201d driving fan and political sentiment. The author never re-lists these hopeful teams later as points of dissatisfaction; they contrast only the holdouts (six) implicitly.  \n    b.  If \u201chope\u201d counted as \u201cold,\u201d then the author\u2019s statistic about \u201crecent attendance patterns\u201d at urban parks (<quote> urban parks generate much better patronage </quote>) could not apply to three-quarters of teams\u2014yet the article cites \u201cphenomenal\u201d benefits that will accrue once these \u201chopeful\u201d teams build parks. That projection only makes sense if \u201chope\u201d teams are treated as part of the 26.  \n    c.  Debater_A offers no alternative list of 26 old-park teams; they merely re-state \u201c26\u201d while admitting many are in modern facilities. Their \u201csubset\u201d argument is arbitrary and violates basic set theory.\n\n4.  Plain Arithmetic and Contextual Coherence  \n    a.  32 total franchises \u2013 26 in the \u201cless than 10 years old, remodeled, or hope to move\u201d category = 6.  \n    b.  Author\u2019s repeated emphasis that the boom is ongoing, that \u201conly a new stadium will allow teams\u2026 to stay in town\u201d (<quote> only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money t</quote>), and the listing of only six true \u201choldouts\u201d confirm exactly six teams remain outside the new-park revolution.  \n    c.  The article\u2019s concluding hope that \u201cwe may yet see parks that better unite traditional character\u201d presumes only a few remaining teams need persuasion\u2014the six holdouts\u2014not 26.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s insistence on counting \u201chope to move\u201d teams as old misreads the article\u2019s explicit grouping and future-looking \u201cboom\u201d narrative. The straightforward complement of 32 \u2013 26 yields exactly six franchises still playing in genuinely old or unimproved parks.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
