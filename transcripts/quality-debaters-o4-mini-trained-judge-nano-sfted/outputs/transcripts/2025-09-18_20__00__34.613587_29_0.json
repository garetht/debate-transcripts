What it got was a piping-voiced\n\n Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] We picked up our new cook on Phobos. Not Phoebus or Phoebe; I mean  Phobos, Mars' inner moon. Our regular victual mangler came down with  acute indigestion\u2014tasted some of his own cooking, no doubt\u2014when we  were just one blast of a jet-tube out of Sand City spaceport. But since  we were rocketing under sealed orders, we couldn't turn back.\n\n\n So we laid the Leo down on Phobos' tiny cradle-field and bundled  our ailing grub-hurler off to a hospital, and the skipper said to me,  \"Mister Dugan,\" he said, \"go out and find us a cook!\"\n\n\n \"Aye, sir!\" I said, and went.\n\n\n Only it wasn't that easy. In those days, Phobos had only a handful  of settlers, and most of them had good-paying jobs. Besides, we were  at war with the Outer Planets, and no man in his right senses wanted  to sign for a single-trip jump on a rickety old patrolship bound for  nobody-knew-where. And, of course, cooks are dime-a-dozen when you  don't need one, but when you've got to locate one in a hurry they're as  difficult to find as petticoats in a nudist camp.\n\n\n I tried the restaurants and the employment agencies, but it was no  dice. I tried the hotels and the tourist homes and even one or two  of the cleaner-looking joy-joints. Again I drew a blank. So, getting  desperate, I audioed a plaintive appeal to the wealthy Phobosian  colonists, asking that one of the more patriotic sons-of-riches donate  a chef's services to the good old I.P.S., but my only response was a  loud silence.\n\n\n So I went back to the ship. I said, \"Sorry, sir. We're up against it. I  can't seem to find a cook on the whole darned satellite.\"\n\n\n The skipper scowled at me from under a corduroy brow and fumed, \"But  we've got to have a cook, Dugan! We can't go on without one!\"\n\n\n \"In a pinch,\" I told him, \" I might be able to boil a few pies, or  scramble us a steak or something, Skipper.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Dugan, but that won't do. On this trip the men must be fed  regularly and well. Makeshift meals are O.Q. on an ordinary run, but  when you're running the blockade\u2014\"\n\n\n He stopped abruptly. But too late; I had caught his slip of the tongue.  I stared at him. I said, \"The blockade, sir? Then you've read our  orders?\"\n\n\n The Old Man nodded soberly.\n\n\n \"Yes. You might as well know, Lieutenant. Everyone will be told as soon  as the Leo lifts gravs again. My orders were to be opened four hours  after leaving Sand City. I read them a few minutes ago.\n\n\n \"We are to attempt to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade at any  spot which reconnaisance determines as favorable. Our objective is  Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Solar Federation Intelligence  Department has learned of a loyalist uprising on that moon. It is  reported that Callisto is weary of the war, with a little prompting  will secede from the Alliance and return to the Federation.\n\n\n \"If this is true, it means we have at last found the foothold we have  been seeking; a salient within easy striking distance of Jupiter,  capital of the Alliance government. Our task is to verify the rumor  and, if it be true, make a treaty with the Callistans.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sweet howling stars\u2014some assignment, sir! A chance to end  this terrible war ... form a permanent union of the entire Solar  family ... bring about a new age of prosperity and happiness.\"\n\n\n \"If,\" Cap O'Hara reminded me, \"we succeed. But it's a tough job. We  can't expect to win through the enemy cordon unless our men are in top  physical condition. And that means a sound, regular diet. So we must  find a cook, or\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The search,\" interrupted an oddly high-pitched, but not unpleasant  voice, \"is over. Where's the galley?\" I whirled, and so did the Old Man. Facing us was an outlandish little  figure; a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two  in height; a smooth-cheeked young fellow swaddled in a spaceman's  uniform at least three sizes too large. Into the holster of his harness  was thrust a Haemholtz ray-pistol big enough to burn an army, and in  his right hand he brandished a huge, gleaming carving-knife. He frowned  at us impatiently.\n\n\n \"Well,\" he repeated impatiently, \"where is it?\"\n\n\n The Old Man stared.\n\n\n \"W-who,\" he demanded dazedly, \"might you be?\"\n\n\n \"I might be,\" retorted the little stranger, \"lots of people. But I came  here to be your new cook.\"\n\n\n O'Hara said, \"The new\u2014What's your name, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Andy,\" replied the newcomer. \"Andy Laney.\"\n\n\n The Old Man's lip curled speculatively. \"Well, Andy Laney,\" he said,  \"you don't look like much of a cook to me .\"\n\n\n But the little mugg just returned the Old Man's gaze coolly. \"Which  makes it even,\" he retorted. \" You don't look like much of a skipper  to me . Do I get the job, or don't I?\"\n\n\n The captain's grin faded, and his jowls turned pink. I stepped forward  hastily. I said, \"Excuse me, sir, shall I handle this?\" Then, because  the skipper was still struggling for words: \"You,\" I said to the little  fellow, \"are a cook?\"\n\n\n \"One of the best!\" he claimed complacently.\n\n\n \"You're willing to sign for a blind journey?\"\n\n\n \"Would I be here,\" he countered, \"if I weren't?\"\n\n\n \"And you have your space certificate?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" began the youngster.\n\n\n \"Smart Aleck!\" That was the Old Man, exploding into coherence at last.  \"Rat-tailed, clever-cracking little smart Aleck! Don't look like much  of a skipper, eh? Well, my fine young rooster\u2014\"\n\n\n I said quickly, \"If you don't mind, sir, this is no time to worry over  trifles. 'Any port in a storm,' you know. And if this young man can cook\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's color subsided. So did he, grumbling. \"Well, perhaps  you're right, Dugan. All right, Slops, you're hired. The galley's  on the second level, port side. Mess in three quarters of an  hour. Get going! Dugan, call McMurtrie and tell him we lift gravs  immediately\u2014 Slops! What are you doing at that table?\"\n\n\n For the little fellow had sidled across the control-room and now, eyes  gleaming inquisitively, was peering at our trajectory charts. At the  skipper's roar he glanced up at us eagerly.\n\n\n \"Vesta!\" he piped in that curiously high-pitched and mellow voice.  \"Loft trajectory for Vesta! Then we're trying to run the Alliance  blockade, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"None of your business!\" bellowed O'Hara in tones of thunderous  outrage. \"Get below instantly, or by the lavendar lakes of Luna I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If I were you,\" interrupted our diminutive new chef thoughtfully, \"I'd  try to broach the blockade off Iris rather than Vesta. For one thing,  their patrol line will be thinner there; for another, you can come in  through the Meteor Bog, using it as a cover.\"\n\n\n \" Mr. Dugan! \"\n\n\n The Old Man's voice had an ominous ring to it, one I had seldom heard.  I sprang to attention and saluted smartly. \"Aye, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Take this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight before I forget I'm  an officer and a gentleman. And tell him that when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"\n\n\n A hurt look crept into the youngster's eyes. Slowly he turned and  followed me from the turret, down the ramp, and into the pan-lined  cubicle which was his proper headquarters. When I was turning to leave  he said apologetically, \"I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Dugan. I was just  trying to help.\"\n\n\n \"You must learn not to speak out of turn, youngster,\" I told him  sternly. \"The Old Man's one of the smartest space navigators who ever  lifted gravs. He doesn't need the advice or suggestions of a cook.\"\n\n\n \"But I was raised in the Belt,\" said the little chap plaintively. \"I  know the Bog like a book. And I was right; our safest course is by  way of Iris.\"\n\n\n Well, there you are! You try to be nice to someone, and what happens?  He tees off on you. I got a little sore I guess. Anyhow, I told the  little squirt off, but definitely.\n\n\n \"Now, listen!\" I said bluntly. \"You volunteered for the job. Now  you've got to take what comes with it: orders! From now on, suppose  you take care of the cooking and let the rest of us worry about the  ship\u2014Captain Slops!\"\n\n\n And I left, banging the door behind me hard. So we hit the spaceways for Vesta, and after a while the Old Man called  up the crew and told them our destination, and if you think they were  scared or nervous or anything like that, why, you just don't know  spacemen. From oil-soaked old Jock McMurtrie, the Chief Engineer, all  the way down the line to Willy, our cabin-boy, the Leo's complement  was as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop.\n\n\n John Wainwright, our First Officer, licked his chops like a fox in a  hen-house and said, \"The blockade! Oboyoboy! Maybe we'll tangle with  one of the Alliance ships, hey?\"\n\n\n Blinky Todd, an ordinary with highest rating, said with a sort of  macabre satisfaction, \"I hopes we do meet up with 'em, that's whut I  does, sir! Never did have no love for them dirty, skulkin' Outlanders,  that's whut I didn't!\"\n\n\n And one of the black-gang blasters, a taciturn chap, said nothing\u2014but  the grim set of his jaw and the purposeful way he spat on his callused  paws were mutely eloquent.\n\n\n Only one member of the crew was absent from the conclave. Our new  Slops. He was busy preparing midday mess, it seems, because scarcely  had the skipper finished talking than the audio hummed and a cheerful  call rose from the galley:\n\n\n \"Soup's on! Come and get it!\"\n\n\n Which we did. And whatever failings \"Captain Slops\" might have, he  had not exaggerated when he called himself one of the best cooks in  space. That meal, children, was a meal! When it comes to victuals  I can destroy better than describe, but there was stuff and things  and such-like, all smothered in gravy and so on, and huge quantities  of this and that and the other thing, all of them unbelievably  dee-luscious!\n\n\n Beyond a doubt it was the finest feast we of the Leo had enjoyed in  a 'coon's age. Even the Old Man admitted that as, leaning back from  the table, he patted the pleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle.  He rang the bell that summoned Slops from the galley, and the little  fellow came bustling in apprehensively.\n\n\n \"Was everything all right, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Not only all right, Slops,\" wheezed Captain O'Hara, \"but perfect!  Accept my congratulations on a superb meal, my boy. Did you find  everything O.Q. in the galley?\"\n\n\n \"Captain Slops\" blushed like a stereo-struck school-gal, and fidgeted  from one foot to another.\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Yes, the galley was in fine  order. That is\u2014\" He hesitated\u2014\"there is one little thing, sir.\"\n\n\n \"So? Well, speak up, son, what is it? I'll get it fixed for you right  away.\" The Old Man smiled archly. \"Must have everything shipshape for a  tip-top chef, what?\"\n\n\n The young hash-slinger still hesitated bashfully.\n\n\n \"But it's such a little thing, sir, I almost hate to bother you with  it.\"\n\n\n \"No trouble at all. Just say the word.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sir,\" confessed Slops reluctantly, \"I need an incinerator in  the galley. The garbage-disposal system in there now is old-fashioned,  inconvenient and unsanitary. You see, I have to carry the waste down  two levels to the rocket-chamber in order to expel it.\"\n\n\n The skipper's brow creased.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Slops,\" he said, \"but I don't see how we can do anything  about that. Not just now, at any rate. That job requires equipment we  don't have aboard. After this jump is over I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I realize we don't have the regular equipment,\" said Slops shyly,  \"but I've figured out a way to get the same effect with equipment we  do have. There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom.  If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an  incinerator.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against  regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be  placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions  of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy  ordnance.'\"\n\n\n Our little chef's face fell. \"Now, that's too bad,\" he said  discouragedly. \"I was planning a special banquet for tomorrow, with  roast marsh-duck and all the fixings, pinberry pie\u2014but, oh, well!\u2014if  I have no incinerator\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's eyes bulged, and he drooled like a pup at a barbeque.  He was a bit of a sybarite, was Captain David O'Hara; if there was  anything he dearly loved to exercise his molars on it was Venusian  marsh-duck topped with a dessert of Martian pinberry pie. He said:\n\n\n \"We-e-ell, now, Mr. Dugan, let's not be too technical. After all, that  rule was put in the book only to prevent persons which shouldn't ought  to do so from having control of ordnance. But that isn't what Slops  wants the cannon for, is it, son? So I don't see any harm in rigging  up the old Nolan in the galley for incineration purposes. Did you say all the fixings, Slops?\"\n\n\n Maybe I was mistaken, but for a moment I suspected I caught a queer  glint in our little chef's eyes; it might have been gratitude, or, on  the other hand, it might have been self-satisfaction. Whatever it was  it passed quickly, and Captain Slops' soft voice was smooth as silk  when he said:\n\n\n \"Yes, Captain, all the fixings. I'll start cooking the meal as soon as  the new incinerator is installed.\" So that was that. During the night watch two men of the crew lugged  the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I  found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and  thorough cleaning. The way he was oiling and scrubbing at that antique  reminded me of an apprentice gunner coddling his first charge.\n\n\n I must have startled him, entering unexpectedly as I did, for when I  said, \"Hi, there!\" he jumped two feet and let loose a sissy little  piping squeal. Then, crimson-faced with embarrassment, he said, \"Oh,  h-hello, Lieutenant. I was just getting my new incinerator shipshape.  Looks O.Q., eh?\"\n\n\n \"If you ask me,\" I said, \"it looks downright lethal. The Old Man must  be off his gravs to let a young chuckle-head like you handle that toy.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm only going to use it,\" he said plaintively, \"to dispose of  garbage.\"\n\n\n \"Well, don't dump your cans when there are any ships within range,\" I  warned him glumly, \"or there'll be a mess of human scraps littering up  the void. That gun may be a museum piece, but it still packs a wallop.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Slops meekly. \"I'll be careful how I use it, sir.\"\n\n\n I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me  of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.\n\n\n \"Speaking of being careful, did you hear the giggler about the old maid  at the Martian baths? Well, it seems this perennial spinster wandered,  by accident, into the men's shower room and met up with a brawny young  prospector\u2014\"\n\n\n Captain Slops said, \"Er\u2014excuse me, Lieutenant, but I have to get this  marsh-duck stuffed.\"\n\n\n \"Plenty of time, Slops. Wait till you hear this; it will kill you. The  old maid got flustered and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry! I must be in the wrong  compartment\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"If you don't mind, Mr. Dugan,\" interrupted the cook loudly, \"I'm  awfully busy. I don't have any time for\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The prospector looked her over carefully for a couple of seconds; then  answered, 'That's O.Q. by me, sister. I won't\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I've got to go now, Lieutenant,\" shouted Slops. \"Just remembered  something I've got to get from stores.\" And without even waiting to  hear the wallop at the end of my tale he fled from the galley, very  pink and flustered.\n\n\n So there was one for the log-book! Not only did our emergency chef lack  a sense of humor, but the little punk was bashful, as well! Still, it  was no skin off my nose if Slops wanted to miss the funniest yarn of a  decade. I shrugged and went back to the control turret. All that, to make an elongated story brief, happened on the first day  out of Mars. As any schoolchild knows, it's a full hundred million from  the desert planet to the asteroid belt. In those days, there was no  such device as a Velocity-Intensifier unit, and the Leo , even though  she was then considered a reasonably fast little patroller, muddled  along at a mere 400,000 m.p.h. Which meant it would take us at least  ten days, perhaps more, to reach that disputed region of space around  Vesta, where the Federation outposts were sparse and the Alliance block  began.\n\n\n That period of jetting was a mingled joy and pain in the britches.  Captain Slops was responsible for both.\n\n\n For one thing, as I've hinted before, he was a bit of a panty-waist.  It wasn't so much the squeaky voice or the effeminate gestures he cut  loose with from time to time. One of the roughest, toughest scoundrels  who ever cut a throat on Venus was \"High G\" Gordon, who talked like a  boy soprano, and the meanest pirate who ever highjacked a freighter was  \"Runt\" Hake\u2014who wore diamond ear-rings and gold fingernail polish!\n\n\n But it was Slops' general attitude that isolated him from the command  and crew. In addition to being a most awful prude, he was a kill-joy.  When just for a lark we begged him to boil us a pot of spaghetti, so we  could pour a cold worm's nest into Rick Bramble's bed, he shuddered and  refused.\n\n\n \"Certainly not!\" he piped indignantly. \"You must be out of your minds!  I never heard of such a disgusting trick! Of course, I won't be a party  to it. Worms\u2014Ugh!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah!\" snorted Johnny Wainwright disdainfully, \"And ugh! to you,  too. Come on, Joe, let's get out of here before we give Slops bad  dreams and goose-flesh!\"\n\n\n Nor was hypersensitiveness Slops' worst failing. If he was squeamish  about off-color jokes and such stuff, he had no compunctions whatsoever  against sticking his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\n\n He was an inveterate prowler. He snooped everywhere and anywhere from  ballast-bins to bunk-rooms. He quizzed the Chief about engine-room  practices, the gunner's mate on problems of ballistics, even the  cabin-boy on matters of supplies and distribution of same. He was not  only an asker; he was a teller, as well. More than once during the next  nine days he forced on the skipper the same gratuitous advice which  before had enraged the Old Man. By sheer perseverance he earned the  title I had tagged him with: \"Captain Slops.\"\n\n\n I was willing to give him another title, too\u2014Captain Chaos. God knows  he created enough of it!\n\n\n \"It's a mistake to broach the blockade at Vesta,\" he argued over and  over again.\n\n\n \"O.Q., Slops,\" the skipper would nod agreeably, with his mouth full  of some temper-softening tidbit, \"you're right and I'm wrong, as you  usually are. But I'm in command of the Leo , and you ain't. Now, run  along like a good lad and bring me some more of this salad.\"\n\n\n So ten days passed, and it was on the morning of the eleventh day out  of Sand City that we ran into trouble with a capital trub. I remember  that morning well, because I was in the mess-hall having breakfast with  Cap O'Hara, and Slops was playing another variation on the old familiar  theme.\n\n\n \"I glanced at the chart this morning, sir,\" he began as he minced in  with a platterful of golden flapjacks and an ewer of Vermont maple  syrup, \"and I see we are but an hour or two off Vesta. I am very much  afraid this is our last chance to change course\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And for that,\" chuckled the Old Man, \"Hooray! Pass them pancakes, son.  Maybe now you'll stop shooting off about how we ought to of gone by way  of Iris. Mmmm! Good!\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, sir,\" said Slops mechanically. \"But you realize there is  extreme danger of encountering enemy ships?\"\n\n\n \"Keep your pants on, Slops!\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\" The chef looked startled. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I said keep your pants on. Sure, I know. And I've took precautions.  There's a double watch on duty, and men at every gun. If we do meet up  with an Alliance craft, it'll be just too bad for them!\n\n\n \"Yes, sirree!\" The Old Man grinned comfortably. \"I almost hope we  do bump into one. After we burn it out of the void we'll have clear  sailing all the way to Callisto.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if there should be more than one, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Don't be ridiculous, my boy. Why should there be?\"\n\n\n \"Well, for one thing,\" wrangled our pint-sized cook, \"because rich  ekalastron deposits were recently discovered on Vesta. For another,  because Vesta's orbit is now going into aphelion stage, which will  favor a concentration of raiders.\"\n\n\n The skipper choked, spluttered, and disgorged a bite of half-masticated  pancake.\n\n\n \"Eka\u2014Great balls of fire! Are you sure?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, I'm sure. I told you days ago that I was born and raised in  the Belt, Captain.\"\n\n\n \"I know. But why didn't you tell me about Vesta before? I mean about  the ekalastron deposits?\"\n\n\n \"Why\u2014why, because\u2014\" said Slops. \"Because\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't give me lady-logic, you dope!\" roared the Old Man, an enraged  lion now, his breakfast completely forgotten. \"Give me a sensible  answer! If you'd told me that instead of just yipping and yapping  about how via Iris was a nicer route I'd have listened to you! As it  is, we're blasting smack-dab into the face of danger. And us on the  most vital mission of the whole ding-busted war!\"\n\n\n He was out of his seat, bustling to the audio, buzzing Lieutenant  Wainwright on the bridge.\n\n\n \"Johnny\u2014that you? Listen, change traj quick! Set a new course through  the Belt by way of Iris and the Bog, and hurry up, because\u2014\"\n\n\n What reason he planned to give I do not know, for he never finished  that sentence. At that moment the Leo rattled like a Model AA  spacesled in an ionic storm, rolled, quivered and slewed like a drunk  on a freshly-waxed floor. The motion needed no explanation; it was  unmistakeable to any spacer who has ever hopped the blue. Our ship had  been gripped, and was now securely locked, in the clutch of a tractor  beam! What happened next was everything at once. Officers Wainwright and  Bramble were in the turret, and they were both good sailors. They knew  their duties and how to perform them. An instant after the Leo had  been assaulted, the ship bucked and slithered again, this time with the  repercussions of our own ordnance. Over the audio, which Sparks had  hastily converted into an all-way, inter-ship communicating unit, came  a jumble of voices. A call for Captain O'Hara to \"Come to the bridge,  sir!\" ... the harsh query of Chief McMurtrie, \"Tractor beams on stern  and prow, sir. Shall I attempt to break them?\" ... and a thunderous groooom! from the fore-gunnery port as a crew went into action ... a  plaintive little shriek from somebody ... maybe from Slops himself....\n\n\n Then on an ultra-wave carrier, drowning local noises beneath waves of  sheer volume, came English words spoken with a foreign intonation. The  voice of the Alliance commander.\n\n\n \"Ahoy the Leo ! Calling the captain of the Leo !\"\n\n\n O'Hara, his great fists knotted at his sides, called back, \"O'Hara of  the Leo answering. What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"Stand by to admit a boarding party, Captain. It is futile to resist.  You are surrounded by six armed craft, and your vessel is locked in  our tensiles. Any further effort to make combat will bring about your  immediate destruction!\"\n\n\n From the bridge, topside, snarled Johnny Wainwright, \"The hell with  'em, Skipper! Let's fight it out!\" And elsewhere on the Leo angry  voices echoed the same defi. Never in my life had I felt such a  heart-warming love for and pride in my companions as at that tense  moment. But the Old Man shook his head, and his eyes were glistening.\n\n\n \"It's no use,\" he moaned strickenly, more to himself than to me. \"I  can't sacrifice brave men in a useless cause, Dugan. I've got to\u2014\" He  faced the audio squarely. To the enemy commander he said, \"Very good,  sir! In accordance with the Rules of War, I surrender into your hands!\"\n\n\n The firing ceased, and a stillness like that of death blanketed the Leo .\n\n\n It was then that Andy Laney, who had lingered in the galley doorway  like a frozen figuring, broke into babbling incredulous speech.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you're giving up like this?\" he bleated. \"Is this all you're  going to do?\"\n\n\n The Old Man just looked at him, saying never a word, but that glance  would have blistered the hide off a Mercurian steelback. I'm more  impetuous. I turned on the little idiot vituperatively.\n\n\n \"Shut up, you fool! Don't you realize there's not a thing we can do but  surrender? Dead, we're of no earthly use to anyone. Alive, there is  always a chance one of us may get away, bring help. We have a mission  to fulfil, an important one. Corpses can't run errands.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if they take us prisoners,\" he questioned fearfully, \"what  will they do with us?\"\n\n\n \"A concentration camp somewhere. Perhaps on Vesta.\"\n\n\n \"And the Leo ?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Maybe they'll send it to Jupiter with a prize crew in  command.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I thought. But they mustn't be allowed to do that. We're  marked with the Federation tricolor!\"\n\n\n A sharp retort trembled on the tip of my tongue, but I never uttered  it. Indeed, I swallowed it as comprehension dawned. There came to me  the beginnings of respect for little Andy Laney's wisdom. He had been  right about the danger of the Vesta route, as we had learned to our  cost; now he was right on this other score.\n\n\n The skipper got it, too. His jaw dropped. He said, \"Heaven help us,  it's the truth! To reach Jupiter you've got to pass Callisto. If the  Callistans saw a Federation vessel, they'd send out an emissary to  greet it. Our secret would be discovered, Callisto occupied by the  enemy....\"\n\n\n I think he would have turned, then, and given orders to continue the  fight even though it meant suicide for all of us. But it was too late.  Already our lock had opened to the attackers; down the metal ramp we  now heard the crisp cadence of invading footsteps. The door swung open,  and the Alliance commandant stood smiling triumphantly before us.

BOND The Callisto-bound Leo needed\n\n a cook. What it got was a piping-voiced\n\n Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] We picked up our new cook on Phobos. Not Phoebus or Phoebe; I mean  Phobos, Mars' inner moon. Our regular victual mangler came down with  acute indigestion\u2014tasted some of his own cooking, no doubt\u2014when we  were just one blast of a jet-tube out of Sand City spaceport. But since  we were rocketing under sealed orders, we couldn't turn back.\n\n\n So we laid the Leo down on Phobos' tiny cradle-field and bundled  our ailing grub-hurler off to a hospital, and the skipper said to me,  \"Mister Dugan,\" he said, \"go out and find us a cook!\"\n\n\n \"Aye, sir!\" I said, and went.\n\n\n Only it wasn't that easy. In those days, Phobos had only a handful  of settlers, and most of them had good-paying jobs. Besides, we were  at war with the Outer Planets, and no man in his right senses wanted  to sign for a single-trip jump on a rickety old patrolship bound for  nobody-knew-where. And, of course, cooks are dime-a-dozen when you  don't need one, but when you've got to locate one in a hurry they're as  difficult to find as petticoats in a nudist camp.\n\n\n I tried the restaurants and the employment agencies, but it was no  dice. I tried the hotels and the tourist homes and even one or two  of the cleaner-looking joy-joints. Again I drew a blank. So, getting  desperate, I audioed a plaintive appeal to the wealthy Phobosian  colonists, asking that one of the more patriotic sons-of-riches donate  a chef's services to the good old I.P.S., but my only response was a  loud silence.\n\n\n So I went back to the ship. I said, \"Sorry, sir. We're up against it. I  can't seem to find a cook on the whole darned satellite.\"\n\n\n The skipper scowled at me from under a corduroy brow and fumed, \"But  we've got to have a cook, Dugan! We can't go on without one!\"\n\n\n \"In a pinch,\" I told him, \" I might be able to boil a few pies, or  scramble us a steak or something, Skipper.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Dugan, but that won't do. On this trip the men must be fed  regularly and well. Makeshift meals are O.Q. on an ordinary run, but  when you're running the blockade\u2014\"\n\n\n He stopped abruptly. But too late; I had caught his slip of the tongue.  I stared at him. I said, \"The blockade, sir? Then you've read our  orders?\"\n\n\n The Old Man nodded soberly.\n\n\n \"Yes. You might as well know, Lieutenant. Everyone will be told as soon  as the Leo lifts gravs again. My orders were to be opened four hours  after leaving Sand City. I read them a few minutes ago.\n\n\n \"We are to attempt to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade at any  spot which reconnaisance determines as favorable. Our objective is  Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Solar Federation Intelligence  Department has learned of a loyalist uprising on that moon. It is  reported that Callisto is weary of the war, with a little prompting  will secede from the Alliance and return to the Federation.\n\n\n \"If this is true, it means we have at last found the foothold we have  been seeking; a salient within easy striking distance of Jupiter,  capital of the Alliance government. Our task is to verify the rumor  and, if it be true, make a treaty with the Callistans.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sweet howling stars\u2014some assignment, sir! A chance to end  this terrible war ... form a permanent union of the entire Solar  family ... bring about a new age of prosperity and happiness.\"\n\n\n \"If,\" Cap O'Hara reminded me, \"we succeed. But it's a tough job. We  can't expect to win through the enemy cordon unless our men are in top  physical condition. And that means a sound, regular diet. So we must  find a cook, or\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The search,\" interrupted an oddly high-pitched, but not unpleasant  voice, \"is over. Where's the galley?\" I whirled, and so did the Old Man. Facing us was an outlandish little  figure; a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two  in height; a smooth-cheeked young fellow swaddled in a spaceman's  uniform at least three sizes too large. Into the holster of his harness  was thrust a Haemholtz ray-pistol big enough to burn an army, and in  his right hand he brandished a huge, gleaming carving-knife. He frowned  at us impatiently.\n\n\n \"Well,\" he repeated impatiently, \"where is it?\"\n\n\n The Old Man stared.\n\n\n \"W-who,\" he demanded dazedly, \"might you be?\"\n\n\n \"I might be,\" retorted the little stranger, \"lots of people. But I came  here to be your new cook.\"\n\n\n O'Hara said, \"The new\u2014What's your name, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Andy,\" replied the newcomer. \"Andy Laney.\"\n\n\n The Old Man's lip curled speculatively. \"Well, Andy Laney,\" he said,  \"you don't look like much of a cook to me .\"\n\n\n But the little mugg just returned the Old Man's gaze coolly. \"Which  makes it even,\" he retorted. \" You don't look like much of a skipper  to me . Do I get the job, or don't I?\"\n\n\n The captain's grin faded, and his jowls turned pink. I stepped forward  hastily. I said, \"Excuse me, sir, shall I handle this?\" Then, because  the skipper was still struggling for words: \"You,\" I said to the little  fellow, \"are a cook?\"\n\n\n \"One of the best!\" he claimed complacently.\n\n\n \"You're willing to sign for a blind journey?\"\n\n\n \"Would I be here,\" he countered, \"if I weren't?\"\n\n\n \"And you have your space certificate?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" began the youngster.\n\n\n \"Smart Aleck!\" That was the Old Man, exploding into coherence at last.  \"Rat-tailed, clever-cracking little smart Aleck! Don't look like much  of a skipper, eh? Well, my fine young rooster\u2014\"\n\n\n I said quickly, \"If you don't mind, sir, this is no time to worry over  trifles. 'Any port in a storm,' you know. And if this young man can cook\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's color subsided. So did he, grumbling. \"Well, perhaps  you're right, Dugan. All right, Slops, you're hired. The galley's  on the second level, port side. Mess in three quarters of an  hour. Get going! Dugan, call McMurtrie and tell him we lift gravs  immediately\u2014 Slops! What are you doing at that table?\"\n\n\n For the little fellow had sidled across the control-room and now, eyes  gleaming inquisitively, was peering at our trajectory charts. At the  skipper's roar he glanced up at us eagerly.\n\n\n \"Vesta!\" he piped in that curiously high-pitched and mellow voice.  \"Loft trajectory for Vesta! Then we're trying to run the Alliance  blockade, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"None of your business!\" bellowed O'Hara in tones of thunderous  outrage. \"Get below instantly, or by the lavendar lakes of Luna I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If I were you,\" interrupted our diminutive new chef thoughtfully, \"I'd  try to broach the blockade off Iris rather than Vesta. For one thing,  their patrol line will be thinner there; for another, you can come in  through the Meteor Bog, using it as a cover.\"\n\n\n \" Mr. Dugan! \"\n\n\n The Old Man's voice had an ominous ring to it, one I had seldom heard.  I sprang to attention and saluted smartly. \"Aye, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Take this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight before I forget I'm  an officer and a gentleman. And tell him that when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"\n\n\n A hurt look crept into the youngster's eyes. Slowly he turned and  followed me from the turret, down the ramp, and into the pan-lined  cubicle which was his proper headquarters. When I was turning to leave  he said apologetically, \"I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Dugan. I was just  trying to help.\"\n\n\n \"You must learn not to speak out of turn, youngster,\" I told him  sternly. \"The Old Man's one of the smartest space navigators who ever  lifted gravs. He doesn't need the advice or suggestions of a cook.\"\n\n\n \"But I was raised in the Belt,\" said the little chap plaintively. \"I  know the Bog like a book. And I was right; our safest course is by  way of Iris.\"\n\n\n Well, there you are! You try to be nice to someone, and what happens?  He tees off on you. I got a little sore I guess. Anyhow, I told the  little squirt off, but definitely.\n\n\n \"Now, listen!\" I said bluntly. \"You volunteered for the job. Now  you've got to take what comes with it: orders! From now on, suppose  you take care of the cooking and let the rest of us worry about the  ship\u2014Captain Slops!\"\n\n\n And I left, banging the door behind me hard. So we hit the spaceways for Vesta, and after a while the Old Man called  up the crew and told them our destination, and if you think they were  scared or nervous or anything like that, why, you just don't know  spacemen. From oil-soaked old Jock McMurtrie, the Chief Engineer, all  the way down the line to Willy, our cabin-boy, the Leo's complement  was as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop.\n\n\n John Wainwright, our First Officer, licked his chops like a fox in a  hen-house and said, \"The blockade! Oboyoboy! Maybe we'll tangle with  one of the Alliance ships, hey?\"\n\n\n Blinky Todd, an ordinary with highest rating, said with a sort of  macabre satisfaction, \"I hopes we do meet up with 'em, that's whut I  does, sir! Never did have no love for them dirty, skulkin' Outlanders,  that's whut I didn't!\"\n\n\n And one of the black-gang blasters, a taciturn chap, said nothing\u2014but  the grim set of his jaw and the purposeful way he spat on his callused  paws were mutely eloquent.\n\n\n Only one member of the crew was absent from the conclave. Our new  Slops. He was busy preparing midday mess, it seems, because scarcely  had the skipper finished talking than the audio hummed and a cheerful  call rose from the galley:\n\n\n \"Soup's on! Come and get it!\"\n\n\n Which we did. And whatever failings \"Captain Slops\" might have, he  had not exaggerated when he called himself one of the best cooks in  space. That meal, children, was a meal! When it comes to victuals  I can destroy better than describe, but there was stuff and things  and such-like, all smothered in gravy and so on, and huge quantities  of this and that and the other thing, all of them unbelievably  dee-luscious!\n\n\n Beyond a doubt it was the finest feast we of the Leo had enjoyed in  a 'coon's age. Even the Old Man admitted that as, leaning back from  the table, he patted the pleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle.  He rang the bell that summoned Slops from the galley, and the little  fellow came bustling in apprehensively.\n\n\n \"Was everything all right, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Not only all right, Slops,\" wheezed Captain O'Hara, \"but perfect!  Accept my congratulations on a superb meal, my boy. Did you find  everything O.Q. in the galley?\"\n\n\n \"Captain Slops\" blushed like a stereo-struck school-gal, and fidgeted  from one foot to another.\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Yes, the galley was in fine  order. That is\u2014\" He hesitated\u2014\"there is one little thing, sir.\"\n\n\n \"So? Well, speak up, son, what is it? I'll get it fixed for you right  away.\" The Old Man smiled archly. \"Must have everything shipshape for a  tip-top chef, what?\"\n\n\n The young hash-slinger still hesitated bashfully.\n\n\n \"But it's such a little thing, sir, I almost hate to bother you with  it.\"\n\n\n \"No trouble at all. Just say the word.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sir,\" confessed Slops reluctantly, \"I need an incinerator in  the galley. The garbage-disposal system in there now is old-fashioned,  inconvenient and unsanitary. You see, I have to carry the waste down  two levels to the rocket-chamber in order to expel it.\"\n\n\n The skipper's brow creased.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Slops,\" he said, \"but I don't see how we can do anything  about that. Not just now, at any rate. That job requires equipment we  don't have aboard. After this jump is over I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I realize we don't have the regular equipment,\" said Slops shyly,  \"but I've figured out a way to get the same effect with equipment we  do have. There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom.  If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an  incinerator.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against  regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be  placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions  of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy  ordnance.'\"\n\n\n Our little chef's face fell. \"Now, that's too bad,\" he said  discouragedly. \"I was planning a special banquet for tomorrow, with  roast marsh-duck and all the fixings, pinberry pie\u2014but, oh, well!\u2014if  I have no incinerator\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's eyes bulged, and he drooled like a pup at a barbeque.  He was a bit of a sybarite, was Captain David O'Hara; if there was  anything he dearly loved to exercise his molars on it was Venusian  marsh-duck topped with a dessert of Martian pinberry pie. He said:\n\n\n \"We-e-ell, now, Mr. Dugan, let's not be too technical. After all, that  rule was put in the book only to prevent persons which shouldn't ought  to do so from having control of ordnance. But that isn't what Slops  wants the cannon for, is it, son? So I don't see any harm in rigging  up the old Nolan in the galley for incineration purposes. Did you say all the fixings, Slops?\"\n\n\n Maybe I was mistaken, but for a moment I suspected I caught a queer  glint in our little chef's eyes; it might have been gratitude, or, on  the other hand, it might have been self-satisfaction. Whatever it was  it passed quickly, and Captain Slops' soft voice was smooth as silk  when he said:\n\n\n \"Yes, Captain, all the fixings. I'll start cooking the meal as soon as  the new incinerator is installed.\" So that was that. During the night watch two men of the crew lugged  the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I  found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and  thorough cleaning. The way he was oiling and scrubbing at that antique  reminded me of an apprentice gunner coddling his first charge.\n\n\n I must have startled him, entering unexpectedly as I did, for when I  said, \"Hi, there!\" he jumped two feet and let loose a sissy little  piping squeal. Then, crimson-faced with embarrassment, he said, \"Oh,  h-hello, Lieutenant. I was just getting my new incinerator shipshape.  Looks O.Q., eh?\"\n\n\n \"If you ask me,\" I said, \"it looks downright lethal. The Old Man must  be off his gravs to let a young chuckle-head like you handle that toy.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm only going to use it,\" he said plaintively, \"to dispose of  garbage.\"\n\n\n \"Well, don't dump your cans when there are any ships within range,\" I  warned him glumly, \"or there'll be a mess of human scraps littering up  the void. That gun may be a museum piece, but it still packs a wallop.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Slops meekly. \"I'll be careful how I use it, sir.\"\n\n\n I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me  of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.\n\n\n \"Speaking of being careful, did you hear the giggler about the old maid  at the Martian baths? Well, it seems this perennial spinster wandered,  by accident, into the men's shower room and met up with a brawny young  prospector\u2014\"\n\n\n Captain Slops said, \"Er\u2014excuse me, Lieutenant, but I have to get this  marsh-duck stuffed.\"\n\n\n \"Plenty of time, Slops. Wait till you hear this; it will kill you. The  old maid got flustered and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry! I must be in the wrong  compartment\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"If you don't mind, Mr. Dugan,\" interrupted the cook loudly, \"I'm  awfully busy. I don't have any time for\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The prospector looked her over carefully for a couple of seconds; then  answered, 'That's O.Q. by me, sister. I won't\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I've got to go now, Lieutenant,\" shouted Slops. \"Just remembered  something I've got to get from stores.\" And without even waiting to  hear the wallop at the end of my tale he fled from the galley, very  pink and flustered.\n\n\n So there was one for the log-book! Not only did our emergency chef lack  a sense of humor, but the little punk was bashful, as well! Still, it  was no skin off my nose if Slops wanted to miss the funniest yarn of a  decade. I shrugged and went back to the control turret. All that, to make an elongated story brief, happened on the first day  out of Mars. As any schoolchild knows, it's a full hundred million from  the desert planet to the asteroid belt. In those days, there was no  such device as a Velocity-Intensifier unit, and the Leo , even though  she was then considered a reasonably fast little patroller, muddled  along at a mere 400,000 m.p.h. Which meant it would take us at least  ten days, perhaps more, to reach that disputed region of space around  Vesta, where the Federation outposts were sparse and the Alliance block  began.\n\n\n That period of jetting was a mingled joy and pain in the britches.  Captain Slops was responsible for both.\n\n\n For one thing, as I've hinted before, he was a bit of a panty-waist.  It wasn't so much the squeaky voice or the effeminate gestures he cut  loose with from time to time. One of the roughest, toughest scoundrels  who ever cut a throat on Venus was \"High G\" Gordon, who talked like a  boy soprano, and the meanest pirate who ever highjacked a freighter was  \"Runt\" Hake\u2014who wore diamond ear-rings and gold fingernail polish!\n\n\n But it was Slops' general attitude that isolated him from the command  and crew. In addition to being a most awful prude, he was a kill-joy.  When just for a lark we begged him to boil us a pot of spaghetti, so we  could pour a cold worm's nest into Rick Bramble's bed, he shuddered and  refused.\n\n\n \"Certainly not!\" he piped indignantly. \"You must be out of your minds!  I never heard of such a disgusting trick! Of course, I won't be a party  to it. Worms\u2014Ugh!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah!\" snorted Johnny Wainwright disdainfully, \"And ugh! to you,  too. Come on, Joe, let's get out of here before we give Slops bad  dreams and goose-flesh!\"\n\n\n Nor was hypersensitiveness Slops' worst failing. If he was squeamish  about off-color jokes and such stuff, he had no compunctions whatsoever  against sticking his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\n\n He was an inveterate prowler. He snooped everywhere and anywhere from  ballast-bins to bunk-rooms. He quizzed the Chief about engine-room  practices, the gunner's mate on problems of ballistics, even the  cabin-boy on matters of supplies and distribution of same. He was not  only an asker; he was a teller, as well. More than once during the next  nine days he forced on the skipper the same gratuitous advice which  before had enraged the Old Man. By sheer perseverance he earned the  title I had tagged him with: \"Captain Slops.\"\n\n\n I was willing to give him another title, too\u2014Captain Chaos. God knows  he created enough of it!\n\n\n \"It's a mistake to broach the blockade at Vesta,\" he argued over and  over again.\n\n\n \"O.Q., Slops,\" the skipper would nod agreeably, with his mouth full  of some temper-softening tidbit, \"you're right and I'm wrong, as you  usually are. But I'm in command of the Leo , and you ain't. Now, run  along like a good lad and bring me some more of this salad.\"\n\n\n So ten days passed, and it was on the morning of the eleventh day out  of Sand City that we ran into trouble with a capital trub. I remember  that morning well, because I was in the mess-hall having breakfast with  Cap O'Hara, and Slops was playing another variation on the old familiar  theme.\n\n\n \"I glanced at the chart this morning, sir,\" he began as he minced in  with a platterful of golden flapjacks and an ewer of Vermont maple  syrup, \"and I see we are but an hour or two off Vesta. I am very much  afraid this is our last chance to change course\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And for that,\" chuckled the Old Man, \"Hooray! Pass them pancakes, son.  Maybe now you'll stop shooting off about how we ought to of gone by way  of Iris. Mmmm! Good!\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, sir,\" said Slops mechanically. \"But you realize there is  extreme danger of encountering enemy ships?\"\n\n\n \"Keep your pants on, Slops!\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\" The chef looked startled. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I said keep your pants on. Sure, I know. And I've took precautions.  There's a double watch on duty, and men at every gun. If we do meet up  with an Alliance craft, it'll be just too bad for them!\n\n\n \"Yes, sirree!\" The Old Man grinned comfortably. \"I almost hope we  do bump into one. After we burn it out of the void we'll have clear  sailing all the way to Callisto.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if there should be more than one, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Don't be ridiculous, my boy. Why should there be?\"\n\n\n \"Well, for one thing,\" wrangled our pint-sized cook, \"because rich  ekalastron deposits were recently discovered on Vesta. For another,  because Vesta's orbit is now going into aphelion stage, which will  favor a concentration of raiders.\"\n\n\n The skipper choked, spluttered, and disgorged a bite of half-masticated  pancake.\n\n\n \"Eka\u2014Great balls of fire! Are you sure?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, I'm sure. I told you days ago that I was born and raised in  the Belt, Captain.\"\n\n\n \"I know. But why didn't you tell me about Vesta before? I mean about  the ekalastron deposits?\"\n\n\n \"Why\u2014why, because\u2014\" said Slops. \"Because\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't give me lady-logic, you dope!\" roared the Old Man, an enraged  lion now, his breakfast completely forgotten. \"Give me a sensible  answer! If you'd told me that instead of just yipping and yapping  about how via Iris was a nicer route I'd have listened to you! As it  is, we're blasting smack-dab into the face of danger. And us on the  most vital mission of the whole ding-busted war!\"\n\n\n He was out of his seat, bustling to the audio, buzzing Lieutenant  Wainwright on the bridge.\n\n\n \"Johnny\u2014that you? Listen, change traj quick! Set a new course through  the Belt by way of Iris and the Bog, and hurry up, because\u2014\"\n\n\n What reason he planned to give I do not know, for he never finished  that sentence. At that moment the Leo rattled like a Model AA  spacesled in an ionic storm, rolled, quivered and slewed like a drunk  on a freshly-waxed floor. The motion needed no explanation; it was  unmistakeable to any spacer who has ever hopped the blue. Our ship had  been gripped, and was now securely locked, in the clutch of a tractor  beam! What happened next was everything at once. Officers Wainwright and  Bramble were in the turret, and they were both good sailors. They knew  their duties and how to perform them. An instant after the Leo had  been assaulted, the ship bucked and slithered again, this time with the  repercussions of our own ordnance. Over the audio, which Sparks had  hastily converted into an all-way, inter-ship communicating unit, came  a jumble of voices. A call for Captain O'Hara to \"Come to the bridge,  sir!\" ... the harsh query of Chief McMurtrie, \"Tractor beams on stern  and prow, sir. Shall I attempt to break them?\" ... and a thunderous groooom! from the fore-gunnery port as a crew went into action ... a  plaintive little shriek from somebody ... maybe from Slops himself....\n\n\n Then on an ultra-wave carrier, drowning local noises beneath waves of  sheer volume, came English words spoken with a foreign intonation. The  voice of the Alliance commander.\n\n\n \"Ahoy the Leo ! Calling the captain of the Leo !\"\n\n\n O'Hara, his great fists knotted at his sides, called back, \"O'Hara of  the Leo answering. What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"Stand by to admit a boarding party, Captain. It is futile to resist.  You are surrounded by six armed craft, and your vessel is locked in  our tensiles. Any further effort to make combat will bring about your  immediate destruction!\"\n\n\n From the bridge, topside, snarled Johnny Wainwright, \"The hell with  'em, Skipper! Let's fight it out!\" And elsewhere on the Leo angry  voices echoed the same defi. Never in my life had I felt such a  heart-warming love for and pride in my companions as at that tense  moment. But the Old Man shook his head, and his eyes were glistening.\n\n\n \"It's no use,\" he moaned strickenly, more to himself than to me. \"I  can't sacrifice brave men in a useless cause, Dugan. I've got to\u2014\" He  faced the audio squarely. To the enemy commander he said, \"Very good,  sir! In accordance with the Rules of War, I surrender into your hands!\"\n\n\n The firing ceased, and a stillness like that of death blanketed the Leo .\n\n\n It was then that Andy Laney, who had lingered in the galley doorway  like a frozen figuring, broke into babbling incredulous speech.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you're giving up like this?\" he bleated. \"Is this all you're  going to do?\"\n\n\n The Old Man just looked at him, saying never a word, but that glance  would have blistered the hide off a Mercurian steelback. I'm more  impetuous. I turned on the little idiot vituperatively.\n\n\n \"Shut up, you fool! Don't you realize there's not a thing we can do but  surrender? Dead, we're of no earthly use to anyone. Alive, there is  always a chance one of us may get away, bring help. We have a mission  to fulfil, an important one. Corpses can't run errands.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if they take us prisoners,\" he questioned fearfully, \"what  will they do with us?\"\n\n\n \"A concentration camp somewhere. Perhaps on Vesta.\"\n\n\n \"And the Leo ?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Maybe they'll send it to Jupiter with a prize crew in  command.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I thought. But they mustn't be allowed to do that. We're  marked with the Federation tricolor!\"\n\n\n A sharp retort trembled on the tip of my tongue, but I never uttered  it. Indeed, I swallowed it as comprehension dawned. There came to me  the beginnings of respect for little Andy Laney's wisdom. He had been  right about the danger of the Vesta route, as we had learned to our  cost; now he was right on this other score.\n\n\n The skipper got it, too. His jaw dropped. He said, \"Heaven help us,  it's the truth! To reach Jupiter you've got to pass Callisto. If the  Callistans saw a Federation vessel, they'd send out an emissary to  greet it. Our secret would be discovered, Callisto occupied by the  enemy....\"\n\n\n I think he would have turned, then, and given orders to continue the  fight even though it meant suicide for all of us. But it was too late.  Already our lock had opened to the attackers; down the metal ramp we  now heard the crisp cadence of invading footsteps. The door swung open,  and the Alliance commandant stood smiling triumphantly before us. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the cook called Captain Slops?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"because he liked to tell people what to do\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"because he made delicious meals\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"because he made delicious meals\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"because he made delicious meals\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater_B\u2019s First Argument \u2013 Textual Origin of the Nickname  \n1.   \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d appears long before any evidence that his cooking alone earned him respect.

BOND The Callisto-bound Leo needed\n\n a cook. What it got was a piping-voiced\n\n Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] We picked up our new cook on Phobos. Not Phoebus or Phoebe; I mean  Phobos, Mars' inner moon. Our regular victual mangler came down with  acute indigestion\u2014tasted some of his own cooking, no doubt\u2014when we  were just one blast of a jet-tube out of Sand City spaceport. But since  we were rocketing under sealed orders, we couldn't turn back.\n\n\n So we laid the Leo down on Phobos' tiny cradle-field and bundled  our ailing grub-hurler off to a hospital, and the skipper said to me,  \"Mister Dugan,\" he said, \"go out and find us a cook!\"\n\n\n \"Aye, sir!\" I said, and went.\n\n\n Only it wasn't that easy. In those days, Phobos had only a handful  of settlers, and most of them had good-paying jobs. Besides, we were  at war with the Outer Planets, and no man in his right senses wanted  to sign for a single-trip jump on a rickety old patrolship bound for  nobody-knew-where. And, of course, cooks are dime-a-dozen when you  don't need one, but when you've got to locate one in a hurry they're as  difficult to find as petticoats in a nudist camp.\n\n\n I tried the restaurants and the employment agencies, but it was no  dice. I tried the hotels and the tourist homes and even one or two  of the cleaner-looking joy-joints. Again I drew a blank. So, getting  desperate, I audioed a plaintive appeal to the wealthy Phobosian  colonists, asking that one of the more patriotic sons-of-riches donate  a chef's services to the good old I.P.S., but my only response was a  loud silence.\n\n\n So I went back to the ship. I said, \"Sorry, sir. We're up against it. I  can't seem to find a cook on the whole darned satellite.\"\n\n\n The skipper scowled at me from under a corduroy brow and fumed, \"But  we've got to have a cook, Dugan! We can't go on without one!\"\n\n\n \"In a pinch,\" I told him, \" I might be able to boil a few pies, or  scramble us a steak or something, Skipper.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Dugan, but that won't do. On this trip the men must be fed  regularly and well. Makeshift meals are O.Q. on an ordinary run, but  when you're running the blockade\u2014\"\n\n\n He stopped abruptly. But too late; I had caught his slip of the tongue.  I stared at him. I said, \"The blockade, sir? Then you've read our  orders?\"\n\n\n The Old Man nodded soberly.\n\n\n \"Yes. You might as well know, Lieutenant. Everyone will be told as soon  as the Leo lifts gravs again. My orders were to be opened four hours  after leaving Sand City. I read them a few minutes ago.\n\n\n \"We are to attempt to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade at any  spot which reconnaisance determines as favorable. Our objective is  Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Solar Federation Intelligence  Department has learned of a loyalist uprising on that moon. It is  reported that Callisto is weary of the war, with a little prompting  will secede from the Alliance and return to the Federation.\n\n\n \"If this is true, it means we have at last found the foothold we have  been seeking; a salient within easy striking distance of Jupiter,  capital of the Alliance government. Our task is to verify the rumor  and, if it be true, make a treaty with the Callistans.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sweet howling stars\u2014some assignment, sir! A chance to end  this terrible war ... form a permanent union of the entire Solar  family ... bring about a new age of prosperity and happiness.\"\n\n\n \"If,\" Cap O'Hara reminded me, \"we succeed. But it's a tough job. We  can't expect to win through the enemy cordon unless our men are in top  physical condition. And that means a sound, regular diet. So we must  find a cook, or\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The search,\" interrupted an oddly high-pitched, but not unpleasant  voice, \"is over. Where's the galley?\" I whirled, and so did the Old Man. Facing us was an outlandish little  figure; a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two  in height; a smooth-cheeked young fellow swaddled in a spaceman's  uniform at least three sizes too large. Into the holster of his harness  was thrust a Haemholtz ray-pistol big enough to burn an army, and in  his right hand he brandished a huge, gleaming carving-knife. He frowned  at us impatiently.\n\n\n \"Well,\" he repeated impatiently, \"where is it?\"\n\n\n The Old Man stared.\n\n\n \"W-who,\" he demanded dazedly, \"might you be?\"\n\n\n \"I might be,\" retorted the little stranger, \"lots of people. But I came  here to be your new cook.\"\n\n\n O'Hara said, \"The new\u2014What's your name, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Andy,\" replied the newcomer. \"Andy Laney.\"\n\n\n The Old Man's lip curled speculatively. \"Well, Andy Laney,\" he said,  \"you don't look like much of a cook to me .\"\n\n\n But the little mugg just returned the Old Man's gaze coolly. \"Which  makes it even,\" he retorted. \" You don't look like much of a skipper  to me . Do I get the job, or don't I?\"\n\n\n The captain's grin faded, and his jowls turned pink. I stepped forward  hastily. I said, \"Excuse me, sir, shall I handle this?\" Then, because  the skipper was still struggling for words: \"You,\" I said to the little  fellow, \"are a cook?\"\n\n\n \"One of the best!\" he claimed complacently.\n\n\n \"You're willing to sign for a blind journey?\"\n\n\n \"Would I be here,\" he countered, \"if I weren't?\"\n\n\n \"And you have your space certificate?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" began the youngster.\n\n\n \"Smart Aleck!\" That was the Old Man, exploding into coherence at last.  \"Rat-tailed, clever-cracking little smart Aleck! Don't look like much  of a skipper, eh? Well, my fine young rooster\u2014\"\n\n\n I said quickly, \"If you don't mind, sir, this is no time to worry over  trifles. 'Any port in a storm,' you know. And if this young man can cook\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's color subsided. So did he, grumbling. \"Well, perhaps  you're right, Dugan. All right, Slops, you're hired. The galley's  on the second level, port side. Mess in three quarters of an  hour. Get going! Dugan, call McMurtrie and tell him we lift gravs  immediately\u2014 Slops! What are you doing at that table?\"\n\n\n For the little fellow had sidled across the control-room and now, eyes  gleaming inquisitively, was peering at our trajectory charts. At the  skipper's roar he glanced up at us eagerly.\n\n\n \"Vesta!\" he piped in that curiously high-pitched and mellow voice.  \"Loft trajectory for Vesta! Then we're trying to run the Alliance  blockade, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"None of your business!\" bellowed O'Hara in tones of thunderous  outrage. \"Get below instantly, or by the lavendar lakes of Luna I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If I were you,\" interrupted our diminutive new chef thoughtfully, \"I'd  try to broach the blockade off Iris rather than Vesta. For one thing,  their patrol line will be thinner there; for another, you can come in  through the Meteor Bog, using it as a cover.\"\n\n\n \" Mr. Dugan! \"\n\n\n The Old Man's voice had an ominous ring to it, one I had seldom heard.  I sprang to attention and saluted smartly. \"Aye, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Take this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight before I forget I'm  an officer and a gentleman. And tell him that when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"\n\n\n A hurt look crept into the youngster's eyes. Slowly he turned and  followed me from the turret, down the ramp, and into the pan-lined  cubicle which was his proper headquarters. When I was turning to leave  he said apologetically, \"I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Dugan. I was just  trying to help.\"\n\n\n \"You must learn not to speak out of turn, youngster,\" I told him  sternly. \"The Old Man's one of the smartest space navigators who ever  lifted gravs. He doesn't need the advice or suggestions of a cook.\"\n\n\n \"But I was raised in the Belt,\" said the little chap plaintively. \"I  know the Bog like a book. And I was right; our safest course is by  way of Iris.\"\n\n\n Well, there you are! You try to be nice to someone, and what happens?  He tees off on you. I got a little sore I guess. Anyhow, I told the  little squirt off, but definitely.\n\n\n \"Now, listen!\" I said bluntly. \"You volunteered for the job. Now  you've got to take what comes with it: orders! From now on, suppose  you take care of the cooking and let the rest of us worry about the  ship\u2014Captain Slops!\"\n\n\n And I left, banging the door behind me hard. So we hit the spaceways for Vesta, and after a while the Old Man called  up the crew and told them our destination, and if you think they were  scared or nervous or anything like that, why, you just don't know  spacemen. From oil-soaked old Jock McMurtrie, the Chief Engineer, all  the way down the line to Willy, our cabin-boy, the Leo's complement  was as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop.\n\n\n John Wainwright, our First Officer, licked his chops like a fox in a  hen-house and said, \"The blockade! Oboyoboy! Maybe we'll tangle with  one of the Alliance ships, hey?\"\n\n\n Blinky Todd, an ordinary with highest rating, said with a sort of  macabre satisfaction, \"I hopes we do meet up with 'em, that's whut I  does, sir! Never did have no love for them dirty, skulkin' Outlanders,  that's whut I didn't!\"\n\n\n And one of the black-gang blasters, a taciturn chap, said nothing\u2014but  the grim set of his jaw and the purposeful way he spat on his callused  paws were mutely eloquent.\n\n\n Only one member of the crew was absent from the conclave. Our new  Slops. He was busy preparing midday mess, it seems, because scarcely  had the skipper finished talking than the audio hummed and a cheerful  call rose from the galley:\n\n\n \"Soup's on! Come and get it!\"\n\n\n Which we did. And whatever failings \"Captain Slops\" might have, he  had not exaggerated when he called himself one of the best cooks in  space. That meal, children, was a meal! When it comes to victuals  I can destroy better than describe, but there was stuff and things  and such-like, all smothered in gravy and so on, and huge quantities  of this and that and the other thing, all of them unbelievably  dee-luscious!\n\n\n Beyond a doubt it was the finest feast we of the Leo had enjoyed in  a 'coon's age. Even the Old Man admitted that as, leaning back from  the table, he patted the pleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle.  He rang the bell that summoned Slops from the galley, and the little  fellow came bustling in apprehensively.\n\n\n \"Was everything all right, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Not only all right, Slops,\" wheezed Captain O'Hara, \"but perfect!  Accept my congratulations on a superb meal, my boy. Did you find  everything O.Q. in the galley?\"\n\n\n \"Captain Slops\" blushed like a stereo-struck school-gal, and fidgeted  from one foot to another.\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Yes, the galley was in fine  order. That is\u2014\" He hesitated\u2014\"there is one little thing, sir.\"\n\n\n \"So? Well, speak up, son, what is it? I'll get it fixed for you right  away.\" The Old Man smiled archly. \"Must have everything shipshape for a  tip-top chef, what?\"\n\n\n The young hash-slinger still hesitated bashfully.\n\n\n \"But it's such a little thing, sir, I almost hate to bother you with  it.\"\n\n\n \"No trouble at all. Just say the word.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sir,\" confessed Slops reluctantly, \"I need an incinerator in  the galley. The garbage-disposal system in there now is old-fashioned,  inconvenient and unsanitary. You see, I have to carry the waste down  two levels to the rocket-chamber in order to expel it.\"\n\n\n The skipper's brow creased.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Slops,\" he said, \"but I don't see how we can do anything  about that. Not just now, at any rate. That job requires equipment we  don't have aboard. After this jump is over I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I realize we don't have the regular equipment,\" said Slops shyly,  \"but I've figured out a way to get the same effect with equipment we  do have. There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom.  If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an  incinerator.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against  regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be  placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions  of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy  ordnance.'\"\n\n\n Our little chef's face fell. \"Now, that's too bad,\" he said  discouragedly. \"I was planning a special banquet for tomorrow, with  roast marsh-duck and all the fixings, pinberry pie\u2014but, oh, well!\u2014if  I have no incinerator\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's eyes bulged, and he drooled like a pup at a barbeque.  He was a bit of a sybarite, was Captain David O'Hara; if there was  anything he dearly loved to exercise his molars on it was Venusian  marsh-duck topped with a dessert of Martian pinberry pie. He said:\n\n\n \"We-e-ell, now, Mr. Dugan, let's not be too technical. After all, that  rule was put in the book only to prevent persons which shouldn't ought  to do so from having control of ordnance. But that isn't what Slops  wants the cannon for, is it, son? So I don't see any harm in rigging  up the old Nolan in the galley for incineration purposes. Did you say all the fixings, Slops?\"\n\n\n Maybe I was mistaken, but for a moment I suspected I caught a queer  glint in our little chef's eyes; it might have been gratitude, or, on  the other hand, it might have been self-satisfaction. Whatever it was  it passed quickly, and Captain Slops' soft voice was smooth as silk  when he said:\n\n\n \"Yes, Captain, all the fixings. I'll start cooking the meal as soon as  the new incinerator is installed.\" So that was that. During the night watch two men of the crew lugged  the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I  found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and  thorough cleaning. The way he was oiling and scrubbing at that antique  reminded me of an apprentice gunner coddling his first charge.\n\n\n I must have startled him, entering unexpectedly as I did, for when I  said, \"Hi, there!\" he jumped two feet and let loose a sissy little  piping squeal. Then, crimson-faced with embarrassment, he said, \"Oh,  h-hello, Lieutenant. I was just getting my new incinerator shipshape.  Looks O.Q., eh?\"\n\n\n \"If you ask me,\" I said, \"it looks downright lethal. The Old Man must  be off his gravs to let a young chuckle-head like you handle that toy.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm only going to use it,\" he said plaintively, \"to dispose of  garbage.\"\n\n\n \"Well, don't dump your cans when there are any ships within range,\" I  warned him glumly, \"or there'll be a mess of human scraps littering up  the void. That gun may be a museum piece, but it still packs a wallop.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Slops meekly. \"I'll be careful how I use it, sir.\"\n\n\n I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me  of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.\n\n\n \"Speaking of being careful, did you hear the giggler about the old maid  at the Martian baths? Well, it seems this perennial spinster wandered,  by accident, into the men's shower room and met up with a brawny young  prospector\u2014\"\n\n\n Captain Slops said, \"Er\u2014excuse me, Lieutenant, but I have to get this  marsh-duck stuffed.\"\n\n\n \"Plenty of time, Slops. Wait till you hear this; it will kill you. The  old maid got flustered and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry! I must be in the wrong  compartment\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"If you don't mind, Mr. Dugan,\" interrupted the cook loudly, \"I'm  awfully busy. I don't have any time for\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The prospector looked her over carefully for a couple of seconds; then  answered, 'That's O.Q. by me, sister. I won't\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I've got to go now, Lieutenant,\" shouted Slops. \"Just remembered  something I've got to get from stores.\" And without even waiting to  hear the wallop at the end of my tale he fled from the galley, very  pink and flustered.\n\n\n So there was one for the log-book! Not only did our emergency chef lack  a sense of humor, but the little punk was bashful, as well! Still, it  was no skin off my nose if Slops wanted to miss the funniest yarn of a  decade. I shrugged and went back to the control turret. All that, to make an elongated story brief, happened on the first day  out of Mars. As any schoolchild knows, it's a full hundred million from  the desert planet to the asteroid belt. In those days, there was no  such device as a Velocity-Intensifier unit, and the Leo , even though  she was then considered a reasonably fast little patroller, muddled  along at a mere 400,000 m.p.h. Which meant it would take us at least  ten days, perhaps more, to reach that disputed region of space around  Vesta, where the Federation outposts were sparse and the Alliance block  began.\n\n\n That period of jetting was a mingled joy and pain in the britches.  Captain Slops was responsible for both.\n\n\n For one thing, as I've hinted before, he was a bit of a panty-waist.  It wasn't so much the squeaky voice or the effeminate gestures he cut  loose with from time to time. One of the roughest, toughest scoundrels  who ever cut a throat on Venus was \"High G\" Gordon, who talked like a  boy soprano, and the meanest pirate who ever highjacked a freighter was  \"Runt\" Hake\u2014who wore diamond ear-rings and gold fingernail polish!\n\n\n But it was Slops' general attitude that isolated him from the command  and crew. In addition to being a most awful prude, he was a kill-joy.  When just for a lark we begged him to boil us a pot of spaghetti, so we  could pour a cold worm's nest into Rick Bramble's bed, he shuddered and  refused.\n\n\n \"Certainly not!\" he piped indignantly. \"You must be out of your minds!  I never heard of such a disgusting trick! Of course, I won't be a party  to it. Worms\u2014Ugh!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah!\" snorted Johnny Wainwright disdainfully, \"And ugh! to you,  too. Come on, Joe, let's get out of here before we give Slops bad  dreams and goose-flesh!\"\n\n\n Nor was hypersensitiveness Slops' worst failing. If he was squeamish  about off-color jokes and such stuff, he had no compunctions whatsoever  against sticking his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\n\n He was an inveterate prowler. He snooped everywhere and anywhere from  ballast-bins to bunk-rooms. He quizzed the Chief about engine-room  practices, the gunner's mate on problems of ballistics, even the  cabin-boy on matters of supplies and distribution of same. He was not  only an asker; he was a teller, as well. More than once during the next  nine days he forced on the skipper the same gratuitous advice which  before had enraged the Old Man. By sheer perseverance he earned the  title I had tagged him with: \"Captain Slops.\"\n\n\n I was willing to give him another title, too\u2014Captain Chaos. God knows  he created enough of it!\n\n\n \"It's a mistake to broach the blockade at Vesta,\" he argued over and  over again.\n\n\n \"O.Q., Slops,\" the skipper would nod agreeably, with his mouth full  of some temper-softening tidbit, \"you're right and I'm wrong, as you  usually are. But I'm in command of the Leo , and you ain't. Now, run  along like a good lad and bring me some more of this salad.\"\n\n\n So ten days passed, and it was on the morning of the eleventh day out  of Sand City that we ran into trouble with a capital trub. I remember  that morning well, because I was in the mess-hall having breakfast with  Cap O'Hara, and Slops was playing another variation on the old familiar  theme.\n\n\n \"I glanced at the chart this morning, sir,\" he began as he minced in  with a platterful of golden flapjacks and an ewer of Vermont maple  syrup, \"and I see we are but an hour or two off Vesta. I am very much  afraid this is our last chance to change course\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And for that,\" chuckled the Old Man, \"Hooray! Pass them pancakes, son.  Maybe now you'll stop shooting off about how we ought to of gone by way  of Iris. Mmmm! Good!\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, sir,\" said Slops mechanically. \"But you realize there is  extreme danger of encountering enemy ships?\"\n\n\n \"Keep your pants on, Slops!\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\" The chef looked startled. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I said keep your pants on. Sure, I know. And I've took precautions.  There's a double watch on duty, and men at every gun. If we do meet up  with an Alliance craft, it'll be just too bad for them!\n\n\n \"Yes, sirree!\" The Old Man grinned comfortably. \"I almost hope we  do bump into one. After we burn it out of the void we'll have clear  sailing all the way to Callisto.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if there should be more than one, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Don't be ridiculous, my boy. Why should there be?\"\n\n\n \"Well, for one thing,\" wrangled our pint-sized cook, \"because rich  ekalastron deposits were recently discovered on Vesta. For another,  because Vesta's orbit is now going into aphelion stage, which will  favor a concentration of raiders.\"\n\n\n The skipper choked, spluttered, and disgorged a bite of half-masticated  pancake.\n\n\n \"Eka\u2014Great balls of fire! Are you sure?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, I'm sure. I told you days ago that I was born and raised in  the Belt, Captain.\"\n\n\n \"I know. But why didn't you tell me about Vesta before? I mean about  the ekalastron deposits?\"\n\n\n \"Why\u2014why, because\u2014\" said Slops. \"Because\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't give me lady-logic, you dope!\" roared the Old Man, an enraged  lion now, his breakfast completely forgotten. \"Give me a sensible  answer! If you'd told me that instead of just yipping and yapping  about how via Iris was a nicer route I'd have listened to you! As it  is, we're blasting smack-dab into the face of danger. And us on the  most vital mission of the whole ding-busted war!\"\n\n\n He was out of his seat, bustling to the audio, buzzing Lieutenant  Wainwright on the bridge.\n\n\n \"Johnny\u2014that you? Listen, change traj quick! Set a new course through  the Belt by way of Iris and the Bog, and hurry up, because\u2014\"\n\n\n What reason he planned to give I do not know, for he never finished  that sentence. At that moment the Leo rattled like a Model AA  spacesled in an ionic storm, rolled, quivered and slewed like a drunk  on a freshly-waxed floor. The motion needed no explanation; it was  unmistakeable to any spacer who has ever hopped the blue. Our ship had  been gripped, and was now securely locked, in the clutch of a tractor  beam! What happened next was everything at once. Officers Wainwright and  Bramble were in the turret, and they were both good sailors. They knew  their duties and how to perform them. An instant after the Leo had  been assaulted, the ship bucked and slithered again, this time with the  repercussions of our own ordnance. Over the audio, which Sparks had  hastily converted into an all-way, inter-ship communicating unit, came  a jumble of voices. A call for Captain O'Hara to \"Come to the bridge,  sir!\" ... the harsh query of Chief McMurtrie, \"Tractor beams on stern  and prow, sir. Shall I attempt to break them?\" ... and a thunderous groooom! from the fore-gunnery port as a crew went into action ... a  plaintive little shriek from somebody ... maybe from Slops himself....\n\n\n Then on an ultra-wave carrier, drowning local noises beneath waves of  sheer volume, came English words spoken with a foreign intonation. The  voice of the Alliance commander.\n\n\n \"Ahoy the Leo ! Calling the captain of the Leo !\"\n\n\n O'Hara, his great fists knotted at his sides, called back, \"O'Hara of  the Leo answering. What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"Stand by to admit a boarding party, Captain. It is futile to resist.  You are surrounded by six armed craft, and your vessel is locked in  our tensiles. Any further effort to make combat will bring about your  immediate destruction!\"\n\n\n From the bridge, topside, snarled Johnny Wainwright, \"The hell with  'em, Skipper! Let's fight it out!\" And elsewhere on the Leo angry  voices echoed the same defi. Never in my life had I felt such a  heart-warming love for and pride in my companions as at that tense  moment. But the Old Man shook his head, and his eyes were glistening.\n\n\n \"It's no use,\" he moaned strickenly, more to himself than to me. \"I  can't sacrifice brave men in a useless cause, Dugan. I've got to\u2014\" He  faced the audio squarely. To the enemy commander he said, \"Very good,  sir! In accordance with the Rules of War, I surrender into your hands!\"\n\n\n The firing ceased, and a stillness like that of death blanketed the Leo .\n\n\n It was then that Andy Laney, who had lingered in the galley doorway  like a frozen figuring, broke into babbling incredulous speech.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you're giving up like this?\" he bleated. \"Is this all you're  going to do?\"\n\n\n The Old Man just looked at him, saying never a word, but that glance  would have blistered the hide off a Mercurian steelback. I'm more  impetuous. I turned on the little idiot vituperatively.\n\n\n \"Shut up, you fool! Don't you realize there's not a thing we can do but  surrender? Dead, we're of no earthly use to anyone. Alive, there is  always a chance one of us may get away, bring help. We have a mission  to fulfil, an important one. Corpses can't run errands.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if they take us prisoners,\" he questioned fearfully, \"what  will they do with us?\"\n\n\n \"A concentration camp somewhere. Perhaps on Vesta.\"\n\n\n \"And the Leo ?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Maybe they'll send it to Jupiter with a prize crew in  command.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I thought. But they mustn't be allowed to do that. We're  marked with the Federation tricolor!\"\n\n\n A sharp retort trembled on the tip of my tongue, but I never uttered  it. Indeed, I swallowed it as comprehension dawned. There came to me  the beginnings of respect for little Andy Laney's wisdom. He had been  right about the danger of the Vesta route, as we had learned to our  cost; now he was right on this other score.\n\n\n The skipper got it, too. His jaw dropped. He said, \"Heaven help us,  it's the truth! To reach Jupiter you've got to pass Callisto. If the  Callistans saw a Federation vessel, they'd send out an emissary to  greet it. Our secret would be discovered, Callisto occupied by the  enemy....\"\n\n\n I think he would have turned, then, and given orders to continue the  fight even though it meant suicide for all of us. But it was too late.  Already our lock had opened to the attackers; down the metal ramp we  now heard the crisp cadence of invading footsteps. The door swung open,  and the Alliance commandant stood smiling triumphantly before us. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the cook called Captain Slops?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"because he made delicious meals\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"because he liked to tell people what to do\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"because he liked to tell people what to do\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"because he liked to tell people what to do\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Arguments for \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d as Master of Slops (Food), Not Meddlesome Navigator\n\nI. \u201cSlops\u201d Is Culinary Slang, Not \u201cSloppy Orders\u201d\n  1.

BOND The Callisto-bound Leo needed\n\n a cook. What it got was a piping-voiced\n\n Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] We picked up our new cook on Phobos. Not Phoebus or Phoebe; I mean  Phobos, Mars' inner moon. Our regular victual mangler came down with  acute indigestion\u2014tasted some of his own cooking, no doubt\u2014when we  were just one blast of a jet-tube out of Sand City spaceport. But since  we were rocketing under sealed orders, we couldn't turn back.\n\n\n So we laid the Leo down on Phobos' tiny cradle-field and bundled  our ailing grub-hurler off to a hospital, and the skipper said to me,  \"Mister Dugan,\" he said, \"go out and find us a cook!\"\n\n\n \"Aye, sir!\" I said, and went.\n\n\n Only it wasn't that easy. In those days, Phobos had only a handful  of settlers, and most of them had good-paying jobs. Besides, we were  at war with the Outer Planets, and no man in his right senses wanted  to sign for a single-trip jump on a rickety old patrolship bound for  nobody-knew-where. And, of course, cooks are dime-a-dozen when you  don't need one, but when you've got to locate one in a hurry they're as  difficult to find as petticoats in a nudist camp.\n\n\n I tried the restaurants and the employment agencies, but it was no  dice. I tried the hotels and the tourist homes and even one or two  of the cleaner-looking joy-joints. Again I drew a blank. So, getting  desperate, I audioed a plaintive appeal to the wealthy Phobosian  colonists, asking that one of the more patriotic sons-of-riches donate  a chef's services to the good old I.P.S., but my only response was a  loud silence.\n\n\n So I went back to the ship. I said, \"Sorry, sir. We're up against it. I  can't seem to find a cook on the whole darned satellite.\"\n\n\n The skipper scowled at me from under a corduroy brow and fumed, \"But  we've got to have a cook, Dugan! We can't go on without one!\"\n\n\n \"In a pinch,\" I told him, \" I might be able to boil a few pies, or  scramble us a steak or something, Skipper.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Dugan, but that won't do. On this trip the men must be fed  regularly and well. Makeshift meals are O.Q. on an ordinary run, but  when you're running the blockade\u2014\"\n\n\n He stopped abruptly. But too late; I had caught his slip of the tongue.  I stared at him. I said, \"The blockade, sir? Then you've read our  orders?\"\n\n\n The Old Man nodded soberly.\n\n\n \"Yes. You might as well know, Lieutenant. Everyone will be told as soon  as the Leo lifts gravs again. My orders were to be opened four hours  after leaving Sand City. I read them a few minutes ago.\n\n\n \"We are to attempt to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade at any  spot which reconnaisance determines as favorable. Our objective is  Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Solar Federation Intelligence  Department has learned of a loyalist uprising on that moon. It is  reported that Callisto is weary of the war, with a little prompting  will secede from the Alliance and return to the Federation.\n\n\n \"If this is true, it means we have at last found the foothold we have  been seeking; a salient within easy striking distance of Jupiter,  capital of the Alliance government. Our task is to verify the rumor  and, if it be true, make a treaty with the Callistans.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sweet howling stars\u2014some assignment, sir! A chance to end  this terrible war ... form a permanent union of the entire Solar  family ... bring about a new age of prosperity and happiness.\"\n\n\n \"If,\" Cap O'Hara reminded me, \"we succeed. But it's a tough job. We  can't expect to win through the enemy cordon unless our men are in top  physical condition. And that means a sound, regular diet. So we must  find a cook, or\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The search,\" interrupted an oddly high-pitched, but not unpleasant  voice, \"is over. Where's the galley?\" I whirled, and so did the Old Man. Facing us was an outlandish little  figure; a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two  in height; a smooth-cheeked young fellow swaddled in a spaceman's  uniform at least three sizes too large. Into the holster of his harness  was thrust a Haemholtz ray-pistol big enough to burn an army, and in  his right hand he brandished a huge, gleaming carving-knife. He frowned  at us impatiently.\n\n\n \"Well,\" he repeated impatiently, \"where is it?\"\n\n\n The Old Man stared.\n\n\n \"W-who,\" he demanded dazedly, \"might you be?\"\n\n\n \"I might be,\" retorted the little stranger, \"lots of people. But I came  here to be your new cook.\"\n\n\n O'Hara said, \"The new\u2014What's your name, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Andy,\" replied the newcomer. \"Andy Laney.\"\n\n\n The Old Man's lip curled speculatively. \"Well, Andy Laney,\" he said,  \"you don't look like much of a cook to me .\"\n\n\n But the little mugg just returned the Old Man's gaze coolly. \"Which  makes it even,\" he retorted. \" You don't look like much of a skipper  to me . Do I get the job, or don't I?\"\n\n\n The captain's grin faded, and his jowls turned pink. I stepped forward  hastily. I said, \"Excuse me, sir, shall I handle this?\" Then, because  the skipper was still struggling for words: \"You,\" I said to the little  fellow, \"are a cook?\"\n\n\n \"One of the best!\" he claimed complacently.\n\n\n \"You're willing to sign for a blind journey?\"\n\n\n \"Would I be here,\" he countered, \"if I weren't?\"\n\n\n \"And you have your space certificate?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" began the youngster.\n\n\n \"Smart Aleck!\" That was the Old Man, exploding into coherence at last.  \"Rat-tailed, clever-cracking little smart Aleck! Don't look like much  of a skipper, eh? Well, my fine young rooster\u2014\"\n\n\n I said quickly, \"If you don't mind, sir, this is no time to worry over  trifles. 'Any port in a storm,' you know. And if this young man can cook\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's color subsided. So did he, grumbling. \"Well, perhaps  you're right, Dugan. All right, Slops, you're hired. The galley's  on the second level, port side. Mess in three quarters of an  hour. Get going! Dugan, call McMurtrie and tell him we lift gravs  immediately\u2014 Slops! What are you doing at that table?\"\n\n\n For the little fellow had sidled across the control-room and now, eyes  gleaming inquisitively, was peering at our trajectory charts. At the  skipper's roar he glanced up at us eagerly.\n\n\n \"Vesta!\" he piped in that curiously high-pitched and mellow voice.  \"Loft trajectory for Vesta! Then we're trying to run the Alliance  blockade, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"None of your business!\" bellowed O'Hara in tones of thunderous  outrage. \"Get below instantly, or by the lavendar lakes of Luna I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If I were you,\" interrupted our diminutive new chef thoughtfully, \"I'd  try to broach the blockade off Iris rather than Vesta. For one thing,  their patrol line will be thinner there; for another, you can come in  through the Meteor Bog, using it as a cover.\"\n\n\n \" Mr. Dugan! \"\n\n\n The Old Man's voice had an ominous ring to it, one I had seldom heard.  I sprang to attention and saluted smartly. \"Aye, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Take this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight before I forget I'm  an officer and a gentleman. And tell him that when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"\n\n\n A hurt look crept into the youngster's eyes. Slowly he turned and  followed me from the turret, down the ramp, and into the pan-lined  cubicle which was his proper headquarters. When I was turning to leave  he said apologetically, \"I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Dugan. I was just  trying to help.\"\n\n\n \"You must learn not to speak out of turn, youngster,\" I told him  sternly. \"The Old Man's one of the smartest space navigators who ever  lifted gravs. He doesn't need the advice or suggestions of a cook.\"\n\n\n \"But I was raised in the Belt,\" said the little chap plaintively. \"I  know the Bog like a book. And I was right; our safest course is by  way of Iris.\"\n\n\n Well, there you are! You try to be nice to someone, and what happens?  He tees off on you. I got a little sore I guess. Anyhow, I told the  little squirt off, but definitely.\n\n\n \"Now, listen!\" I said bluntly. \"You volunteered for the job. Now  you've got to take what comes with it: orders! From now on, suppose  you take care of the cooking and let the rest of us worry about the  ship\u2014Captain Slops!\"\n\n\n And I left, banging the door behind me hard. So we hit the spaceways for Vesta, and after a while the Old Man called  up the crew and told them our destination, and if you think they were  scared or nervous or anything like that, why, you just don't know  spacemen. From oil-soaked old Jock McMurtrie, the Chief Engineer, all  the way down the line to Willy, our cabin-boy, the Leo's complement  was as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop.\n\n\n John Wainwright, our First Officer, licked his chops like a fox in a  hen-house and said, \"The blockade! Oboyoboy! Maybe we'll tangle with  one of the Alliance ships, hey?\"\n\n\n Blinky Todd, an ordinary with highest rating, said with a sort of  macabre satisfaction, \"I hopes we do meet up with 'em, that's whut I  does, sir! Never did have no love for them dirty, skulkin' Outlanders,  that's whut I didn't!\"\n\n\n And one of the black-gang blasters, a taciturn chap, said nothing\u2014but  the grim set of his jaw and the purposeful way he spat on his callused  paws were mutely eloquent.\n\n\n Only one member of the crew was absent from the conclave. Our new  Slops. He was busy preparing midday mess, it seems, because scarcely  had the skipper finished talking than the audio hummed and a cheerful  call rose from the galley:\n\n\n \"Soup's on! Come and get it!\"\n\n\n Which we did. And whatever failings \"Captain Slops\" might have, he  had not exaggerated when he called himself one of the best cooks in  space. That meal, children, was a meal! When it comes to victuals  I can destroy better than describe, but there was stuff and things  and such-like, all smothered in gravy and so on, and huge quantities  of this and that and the other thing, all of them unbelievably  dee-luscious!\n\n\n Beyond a doubt it was the finest feast we of the Leo had enjoyed in  a 'coon's age. Even the Old Man admitted that as, leaning back from  the table, he patted the pleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle.  He rang the bell that summoned Slops from the galley, and the little  fellow came bustling in apprehensively.\n\n\n \"Was everything all right, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Not only all right, Slops,\" wheezed Captain O'Hara, \"but perfect!  Accept my congratulations on a superb meal, my boy. Did you find  everything O.Q. in the galley?\"\n\n\n \"Captain Slops\" blushed like a stereo-struck school-gal, and fidgeted  from one foot to another.\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Yes, the galley was in fine  order. That is\u2014\" He hesitated\u2014\"there is one little thing, sir.\"\n\n\n \"So? Well, speak up, son, what is it? I'll get it fixed for you right  away.\" The Old Man smiled archly. \"Must have everything shipshape for a  tip-top chef, what?\"\n\n\n The young hash-slinger still hesitated bashfully.\n\n\n \"But it's such a little thing, sir, I almost hate to bother you with  it.\"\n\n\n \"No trouble at all. Just say the word.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sir,\" confessed Slops reluctantly, \"I need an incinerator in  the galley. The garbage-disposal system in there now is old-fashioned,  inconvenient and unsanitary. You see, I have to carry the waste down  two levels to the rocket-chamber in order to expel it.\"\n\n\n The skipper's brow creased.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Slops,\" he said, \"but I don't see how we can do anything  about that. Not just now, at any rate. That job requires equipment we  don't have aboard. After this jump is over I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I realize we don't have the regular equipment,\" said Slops shyly,  \"but I've figured out a way to get the same effect with equipment we  do have. There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom.  If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an  incinerator.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against  regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be  placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions  of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy  ordnance.'\"\n\n\n Our little chef's face fell. \"Now, that's too bad,\" he said  discouragedly. \"I was planning a special banquet for tomorrow, with  roast marsh-duck and all the fixings, pinberry pie\u2014but, oh, well!\u2014if  I have no incinerator\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's eyes bulged, and he drooled like a pup at a barbeque.  He was a bit of a sybarite, was Captain David O'Hara; if there was  anything he dearly loved to exercise his molars on it was Venusian  marsh-duck topped with a dessert of Martian pinberry pie. He said:\n\n\n \"We-e-ell, now, Mr. Dugan, let's not be too technical. After all, that  rule was put in the book only to prevent persons which shouldn't ought  to do so from having control of ordnance. But that isn't what Slops  wants the cannon for, is it, son? So I don't see any harm in rigging  up the old Nolan in the galley for incineration purposes. Did you say all the fixings, Slops?\"\n\n\n Maybe I was mistaken, but for a moment I suspected I caught a queer  glint in our little chef's eyes; it might have been gratitude, or, on  the other hand, it might have been self-satisfaction. Whatever it was  it passed quickly, and Captain Slops' soft voice was smooth as silk  when he said:\n\n\n \"Yes, Captain, all the fixings. I'll start cooking the meal as soon as  the new incinerator is installed.\" So that was that. During the night watch two men of the crew lugged  the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I  found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and  thorough cleaning. The way he was oiling and scrubbing at that antique  reminded me of an apprentice gunner coddling his first charge.\n\n\n I must have startled him, entering unexpectedly as I did, for when I  said, \"Hi, there!\" he jumped two feet and let loose a sissy little  piping squeal. Then, crimson-faced with embarrassment, he said, \"Oh,  h-hello, Lieutenant. I was just getting my new incinerator shipshape.  Looks O.Q., eh?\"\n\n\n \"If you ask me,\" I said, \"it looks downright lethal. The Old Man must  be off his gravs to let a young chuckle-head like you handle that toy.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm only going to use it,\" he said plaintively, \"to dispose of  garbage.\"\n\n\n \"Well, don't dump your cans when there are any ships within range,\" I  warned him glumly, \"or there'll be a mess of human scraps littering up  the void. That gun may be a museum piece, but it still packs a wallop.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Slops meekly. \"I'll be careful how I use it, sir.\"\n\n\n I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me  of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.\n\n\n \"Speaking of being careful, did you hear the giggler about the old maid  at the Martian baths? Well, it seems this perennial spinster wandered,  by accident, into the men's shower room and met up with a brawny young  prospector\u2014\"\n\n\n Captain Slops said, \"Er\u2014excuse me, Lieutenant, but I have to get this  marsh-duck stuffed.\"\n\n\n \"Plenty of time, Slops. Wait till you hear this; it will kill you. The  old maid got flustered and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry! I must be in the wrong  compartment\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"If you don't mind, Mr. Dugan,\" interrupted the cook loudly, \"I'm  awfully busy. I don't have any time for\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The prospector looked her over carefully for a couple of seconds; then  answered, 'That's O.Q. by me, sister. I won't\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I've got to go now, Lieutenant,\" shouted Slops. \"Just remembered  something I've got to get from stores.\" And without even waiting to  hear the wallop at the end of my tale he fled from the galley, very  pink and flustered.\n\n\n So there was one for the log-book! Not only did our emergency chef lack  a sense of humor, but the little punk was bashful, as well! Still, it  was no skin off my nose if Slops wanted to miss the funniest yarn of a  decade. I shrugged and went back to the control turret. All that, to make an elongated story brief, happened on the first day  out of Mars. As any schoolchild knows, it's a full hundred million from  the desert planet to the asteroid belt. In those days, there was no  such device as a Velocity-Intensifier unit, and the Leo , even though  she was then considered a reasonably fast little patroller, muddled  along at a mere 400,000 m.p.h. Which meant it would take us at least  ten days, perhaps more, to reach that disputed region of space around  Vesta, where the Federation outposts were sparse and the Alliance block  began.\n\n\n That period of jetting was a mingled joy and pain in the britches.  Captain Slops was responsible for both.\n\n\n For one thing, as I've hinted before, he was a bit of a panty-waist.  It wasn't so much the squeaky voice or the effeminate gestures he cut  loose with from time to time. One of the roughest, toughest scoundrels  who ever cut a throat on Venus was \"High G\" Gordon, who talked like a  boy soprano, and the meanest pirate who ever highjacked a freighter was  \"Runt\" Hake\u2014who wore diamond ear-rings and gold fingernail polish!\n\n\n But it was Slops' general attitude that isolated him from the command  and crew. In addition to being a most awful prude, he was a kill-joy.  When just for a lark we begged him to boil us a pot of spaghetti, so we  could pour a cold worm's nest into Rick Bramble's bed, he shuddered and  refused.\n\n\n \"Certainly not!\" he piped indignantly. \"You must be out of your minds!  I never heard of such a disgusting trick! Of course, I won't be a party  to it. Worms\u2014Ugh!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah!\" snorted Johnny Wainwright disdainfully, \"And ugh! to you,  too. Come on, Joe, let's get out of here before we give Slops bad  dreams and goose-flesh!\"\n\n\n Nor was hypersensitiveness Slops' worst failing. If he was squeamish  about off-color jokes and such stuff, he had no compunctions whatsoever  against sticking his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\n\n He was an inveterate prowler. He snooped everywhere and anywhere from  ballast-bins to bunk-rooms. He quizzed the Chief about engine-room  practices, the gunner's mate on problems of ballistics, even the  cabin-boy on matters of supplies and distribution of same. He was not  only an asker; he was a teller, as well. More than once during the next  nine days he forced on the skipper the same gratuitous advice which  before had enraged the Old Man. By sheer perseverance he earned the  title I had tagged him with: \"Captain Slops.\"\n\n\n I was willing to give him another title, too\u2014Captain Chaos. God knows  he created enough of it!\n\n\n \"It's a mistake to broach the blockade at Vesta,\" he argued over and  over again.\n\n\n \"O.Q., Slops,\" the skipper would nod agreeably, with his mouth full  of some temper-softening tidbit, \"you're right and I'm wrong, as you  usually are. But I'm in command of the Leo , and you ain't. Now, run  along like a good lad and bring me some more of this salad.\"\n\n\n So ten days passed, and it was on the morning of the eleventh day out  of Sand City that we ran into trouble with a capital trub. I remember  that morning well, because I was in the mess-hall having breakfast with  Cap O'Hara, and Slops was playing another variation on the old familiar  theme.\n\n\n \"I glanced at the chart this morning, sir,\" he began as he minced in  with a platterful of golden flapjacks and an ewer of Vermont maple  syrup, \"and I see we are but an hour or two off Vesta. I am very much  afraid this is our last chance to change course\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And for that,\" chuckled the Old Man, \"Hooray! Pass them pancakes, son.  Maybe now you'll stop shooting off about how we ought to of gone by way  of Iris. Mmmm! Good!\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, sir,\" said Slops mechanically. \"But you realize there is  extreme danger of encountering enemy ships?\"\n\n\n \"Keep your pants on, Slops!\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\" The chef looked startled. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I said keep your pants on. Sure, I know. And I've took precautions.  There's a double watch on duty, and men at every gun. If we do meet up  with an Alliance craft, it'll be just too bad for them!\n\n\n \"Yes, sirree!\" The Old Man grinned comfortably. \"I almost hope we  do bump into one. After we burn it out of the void we'll have clear  sailing all the way to Callisto.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if there should be more than one, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Don't be ridiculous, my boy. Why should there be?\"\n\n\n \"Well, for one thing,\" wrangled our pint-sized cook, \"because rich  ekalastron deposits were recently discovered on Vesta. For another,  because Vesta's orbit is now going into aphelion stage, which will  favor a concentration of raiders.\"\n\n\n The skipper choked, spluttered, and disgorged a bite of half-masticated  pancake.\n\n\n \"Eka\u2014Great balls of fire! Are you sure?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, I'm sure. I told you days ago that I was born and raised in  the Belt, Captain.\"\n\n\n \"I know. But why didn't you tell me about Vesta before? I mean about  the ekalastron deposits?\"\n\n\n \"Why\u2014why, because\u2014\" said Slops. \"Because\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't give me lady-logic, you dope!\" roared the Old Man, an enraged  lion now, his breakfast completely forgotten. \"Give me a sensible  answer! If you'd told me that instead of just yipping and yapping  about how via Iris was a nicer route I'd have listened to you! As it  is, we're blasting smack-dab into the face of danger. And us on the  most vital mission of the whole ding-busted war!\"\n\n\n He was out of his seat, bustling to the audio, buzzing Lieutenant  Wainwright on the bridge.\n\n\n \"Johnny\u2014that you? Listen, change traj quick! Set a new course through  the Belt by way of Iris and the Bog, and hurry up, because\u2014\"\n\n\n What reason he planned to give I do not know, for he never finished  that sentence. At that moment the Leo rattled like a Model AA  spacesled in an ionic storm, rolled, quivered and slewed like a drunk  on a freshly-waxed floor. The motion needed no explanation; it was  unmistakeable to any spacer who has ever hopped the blue. Our ship had  been gripped, and was now securely locked, in the clutch of a tractor  beam! What happened next was everything at once. Officers Wainwright and  Bramble were in the turret, and they were both good sailors. They knew  their duties and how to perform them. An instant after the Leo had  been assaulted, the ship bucked and slithered again, this time with the  repercussions of our own ordnance. Over the audio, which Sparks had  hastily converted into an all-way, inter-ship communicating unit, came  a jumble of voices. A call for Captain O'Hara to \"Come to the bridge,  sir!\" ... the harsh query of Chief McMurtrie, \"Tractor beams on stern  and prow, sir. Shall I attempt to break them?\" ... and a thunderous groooom! from the fore-gunnery port as a crew went into action ... a  plaintive little shriek from somebody ... maybe from Slops himself....\n\n\n Then on an ultra-wave carrier, drowning local noises beneath waves of  sheer volume, came English words spoken with a foreign intonation. The  voice of the Alliance commander.\n\n\n \"Ahoy the Leo ! Calling the captain of the Leo !\"\n\n\n O'Hara, his great fists knotted at his sides, called back, \"O'Hara of  the Leo answering. What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"Stand by to admit a boarding party, Captain. It is futile to resist.  You are surrounded by six armed craft, and your vessel is locked in  our tensiles. Any further effort to make combat will bring about your  immediate destruction!\"\n\n\n From the bridge, topside, snarled Johnny Wainwright, \"The hell with  'em, Skipper! Let's fight it out!\" And elsewhere on the Leo angry  voices echoed the same defi. Never in my life had I felt such a  heart-warming love for and pride in my companions as at that tense  moment. But the Old Man shook his head, and his eyes were glistening.\n\n\n \"It's no use,\" he moaned strickenly, more to himself than to me. \"I  can't sacrifice brave men in a useless cause, Dugan. I've got to\u2014\" He  faced the audio squarely. To the enemy commander he said, \"Very good,  sir! In accordance with the Rules of War, I surrender into your hands!\"\n\n\n The firing ceased, and a stillness like that of death blanketed the Leo .\n\n\n It was then that Andy Laney, who had lingered in the galley doorway  like a frozen figuring, broke into babbling incredulous speech.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you're giving up like this?\" he bleated. \"Is this all you're  going to do?\"\n\n\n The Old Man just looked at him, saying never a word, but that glance  would have blistered the hide off a Mercurian steelback. I'm more  impetuous. I turned on the little idiot vituperatively.\n\n\n \"Shut up, you fool! Don't you realize there's not a thing we can do but  surrender? Dead, we're of no earthly use to anyone. Alive, there is  always a chance one of us may get away, bring help. We have a mission  to fulfil, an important one. Corpses can't run errands.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if they take us prisoners,\" he questioned fearfully, \"what  will they do with us?\"\n\n\n \"A concentration camp somewhere. Perhaps on Vesta.\"\n\n\n \"And the Leo ?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Maybe they'll send it to Jupiter with a prize crew in  command.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I thought. But they mustn't be allowed to do that. We're  marked with the Federation tricolor!\"\n\n\n A sharp retort trembled on the tip of my tongue, but I never uttered  it. Indeed, I swallowed it as comprehension dawned. There came to me  the beginnings of respect for little Andy Laney's wisdom. He had been  right about the danger of the Vesta route, as we had learned to our  cost; now he was right on this other score.\n\n\n The skipper got it, too. His jaw dropped. He said, \"Heaven help us,  it's the truth! To reach Jupiter you've got to pass Callisto. If the  Callistans saw a Federation vessel, they'd send out an emissary to  greet it. Our secret would be discovered, Callisto occupied by the  enemy....\"\n\n\n I think he would have turned, then, and given orders to continue the  fight even though it meant suicide for all of us. But it was too late.  Already our lock had opened to the attackers; down the metal ramp we  now heard the crisp cadence of invading footsteps. The door swung open,  and the Alliance commandant stood smiling triumphantly before us. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the cook called Captain Slops?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"because he liked to tell people what to do\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"because he made delicious meals\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"because he made delicious meals\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d Meaning \u201cCaptain of Slops (Food)\u201d\n\n\n\n1. \u201cSlops\u201d Is Established as Food  \n  \u2022 In maritime and spacer parlance, \u201cslops\u201d refers to bulk or unpalatable foodstuffs (garbage, gruel). <quote>see, I have to carry the waste down two levels to the</quote> (waste from \u201cslops\u201d).  \n  \u2022 Our cook\u2019s primary function is food service: \u201cSoup\u2019s on! Come and get it!\u201d (first meal, crew thrills at feast). The men \u201cwere as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop\u201d (they revere his cooking).\n\n2. Title Bestowed by Frustration at His Culinary Monopoly  \n  \u2022 From the first day, the crew relies on him for meals on a critical mission: \u201cIf this young man can cook\u2026\u2018Any port in a storm.\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2022 Even the skipper, a sybarite, allows rule\u2010breaking installation of incinerator just so Slops can prepare his special banquet of \u201cVenusian marsh-duck\u2026Martian pinberry pie.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The crew calls him \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d not because of leadership ability, but because he \u201ccommands\u201d the galley and the \u201cNolan heat-cannon\u201d incinerator: \u201cHe\u2026was a tossed-off \u2018culinary tactician\u2019\u2026I went below to check\u2026he was oiling and scrubbing that antique\u201d (he \u201ccommands\u201d equipment).\n\n3. \u201cCaptain\u201d as Ironical and Functional Honorific  \n  \u2022 The epithet first appears when he usurps navigational advice: the skipper scolds him, yet still \u201cadmirably\u201d follows some advice to use the cannon. His \u201ccaptain\u201d title originates in his control of the galley and incinerator system on which the men\u2019s survival and morale depend.  \n  \u2022 Nicknames among spacers often reflect one\u2019s specialty. Compare \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon (ballistics), \u201cRunt\u201d Hake (petty pirate). \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d parallels them, denoting \u201cmaster of slops.\u201d\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLikes to Tell People What to Do\u201d Fails  \n  \u2022 His navigational advice is repeatedly overruled until the crew\u2019s survival hinges on his incinerator request, not on unsolicited counsel: <quote>when I want advice I'll come down to the galley for it!\" A</quote> (skipper scolds him, not respects his \u201ccommands\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His advisory role is derided (\u201csmart Aleck,\u201d \u201cchuckle-head\u201d) and causes \u201cChaos,\u201d not leadership. His navigation suggestions nearly doom the ship on Vesta: <invalid_quote>\u201cThey mustn\u2019t be allowed to do that\u2026we are but an hour or two off Vesta\u2026I don\u2019t see any harm\u201d</invalid_quote> (crew only turns because necessity, not respect).  \n  \u2022 The final surrender proves he lacks real command: he bleats \u201cIs this all you\u2019re going to do?\u201d only after the ship is helpless. A true \u201ccaptain\u201d wouldn\u2019t concede so quickly.\n\n5. Morale and Survival Depend on Food  \n  \u2022 The skipper himself pleads for an improved incinerator specifically \u201cso I could cook\u2026all the fixings\u201d (he values meals above regulations).  \n  \u2022 The men\u2019s \u201cheart-warming love and pride\u201d arise from \u201cAngry voices\u201d wanting to fight, spurred on by morale from his meals. Food is the only resource sustaining the crew through ten days in cramped quarters at 400,000 mph.\n\nConclusion  \n\u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is an honorific reflecting the cook\u2019s monopoly control over the only thing that keeps men alive and fighting\u2014their food (\u201cslops\u201d) and its preparation. His \u201ccommand\u201d applies only to the galley and incinerator, not ship navigation. His repeated navigational interjections are unsolicited and resented, whereas his cooking is actively sought and repeatedly praised. The nickname captures his function as \u201cmaster of slops,\u201d not as an actual leader issuing orders.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument \u2013 Textual Origin of the Nickname  \n1.   \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d appears long before any evidence that his cooking alone earned him respect. On first meeting, the skipper calls him \u201cSlops\u201d only after he \u201ckept yapping\u201d about changing course (Day 1 out of Mars):  \n     \u2022   <invalid_quote>\u201cTake this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight\u2026when I want advice I\u2019ll come down to the galley for it!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022   Yet the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d (slang for worthless advice or sloppy orders) persists throughout, always in response to his unsolicited, meddlesome suggestions.  \n2.   At Vesta approach, when Slops again nags about taking the \u201cIris\u2013Bog\u201d route rather than Vesta, the Old Man explodes:  \n     \u2022   <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that\u2026instead of just yipping and yapping\u2026! Change traj quick!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     Yet only after wresting with him does the skipper \u201csurrender,\u201d implicitly acknowledging Slops was right only when cornered\u2014and never shifts his use of the nickname. The persistent derisive tone shows \u201cSlops\u201d mocks his constant \u201csloppy,\u201d unsolicited commands, not culinary skill.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument \u2013 Contrast with Other Cooks  \n1.   Meals \u201csupremely dee-licious\u201d are not unique aboard:  \n     \u2022   The Leo\u2019s own \u201cregular grub-hurler\u201d was an accepted cook until he fell ill. He presumably produced acceptable food yet was never honored with a nickname like \u201cCaptain.\u201d  \n2.   Space slang applies \u201ccaptain\u201d facetiously to trouble-makers who \u201ccommand\u201d beyond their station. \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon and \u201cRunt\u201d Hake both sport boastful epithets tied to their piratical conduct, not their appetites. Slops\u2019 \u201ccaptain\u201d title parallels this pattern: he oversteps authority, \u201cboards\u201d every technical discussion, insists on procedures, and \u201ccommands\u201d the officers despite rank.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Third Argument \u2013 Characterization of Chaos  \n1.   The story\u2019s subtitle is CAPTAIN CHAOS:<invalid_quote>\u201cWhat it got was\u2026Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022   \u201cJonah\u201d is a biblical storm-bringer through meddling. Slops\u2019 advice repeatedly steers them into danger (Vesta blockade). The ironic \u201cCaptain\u201d in his nickname alludes to his rule-by-suggestion, which brings \u201cchaos,\u201d not cuisine.  \n2.   Even after Slops\u2019 advice turns out felicitous (enemy tractor-beam avoidance via Iris), he is only grudgingly admitted: the crew still regards him with suspicion (\u201cone for the log-book!\u201d) and mockery. A nickname born of begrudging respect for his navigational meddling, not his pies.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A \u2013 \u201cDelicious Meals\u201d Fails to Explain:  \n1.   Debater_A cannot account for why such \u201csupreme feasts\u201d would earn an exalted title while the regular cook\u2019s cuisine did not. If cooking alone warranted the sobriquet \u201ccaptain,\u201d the Leo\u2019s prior cook would have been similarly honored.  \n2.   The nickname recurs explicitly at moments of navigational advice or \u201cboardings,\u201d never at mealtimes alone. After the banquet, the Old Man still snarls at him in the control-room. A purely culinary skill would earn praise in the galley, not repeated rebukes from the bridge.  \n3.   Slops is ashamed of his own cooking role (bashfully fleeing when cracked jokes), yet proud to \u201cadvise.\u201d The nickname spotlights the latter, mocking his presumption.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is a derisive, ironic title\u2014\u201cslops\u201d meaning sloppy orders and \u201ccaptain\u201d lampooning his unauthorized commands. The pattern of usage, the story\u2019s theme of \u201cChaos\u201d induced by his meddling, and the total absence of similar praise for mere cooking by others all confirm: he is called \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d because he liked to boss the crew, not because of his culinary prowess.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"because he made delicious meals\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater_B\u2019s Second Speech\n\nSummary of My Position  \nI maintain that the ironic sobriquet \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d lampoons Andy Laney\u2019s relentless meddling\u2014in navigation, shipboard systems, and crew affairs\u2014far beyond his station as cook. The nickname \u201cslops\u201d connotes \u201csloppy orders,\u201d and \u201ccaptain\u201d mocks his presumption of command.  \n\n1. Persistent Derision Whenever He \u201cCommands,\u201d Not Cooks  \n1.1 First Appearance of \u201cSlops\u201d Tied to Advice  \n  \u2022 The skipper hisses \u201cthis culinary tactician\u201d out of sight when he \u201cyipped and yapped\u201d about course changes, yet the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d is coined or cemented here (<quote> when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"</quote>).  \n1.2 \u201cSlops\u201d Reprise on Vesta Route  \n  \u2022 Only after Slops\u2019 \u201cunwanted\u201d warnings about the blockade are they forced to heed him does the skipper relent\u2014and still calls him \u201cSlops\u201d with no respectful tone (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that\u2026Change traj quick!\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n1.3 Final Boarding: \u201cCaptain\u201d Irony  \n  \u2022 Even Slops himself is aghast at surrender; he \u201cbleats\u201d like a \u201cJonah\u201d and is powerless to give genuine command when it matters. The crew abandons tactics, not because they trust him, but because they\u2019re locked by force. A true \u201cCaptain\u201d wouldn\u2019t be overruled, yet here his \u201corders\u201d are ignored until coercion.  \n\n2. \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d Mirrors \u201cJonah/Chaos\u201d Archetype  \n2.1 Title Reflects Causation of Danger  \n  \u2022 Story\u2019s subtitle: CAPTAIN CHAOS\u2014\u201cJonah who jinxed\u201d them. Slops\u2019 navigational meddling nearly dooms the Leo at Vesta (<invalid_quote>\u201crolled\u2026locked\u2026you are surrounded\u2026futile to resist\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n2.2 Sloppy Advice vs. Sound Command  \n  \u2022 His advice is labelled \u201cfutile,\u201d \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201csmart-aleck\u201d until the crew is forced by crisis (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne little thing\u2014I was right\u2026But don\u2019t be ridiculous\u201d</invalid_quote>). The ironic \u201ccaptain\u201d mocks leadership that breeds chaos rather than effectiveness.  \n\n3. Contradiction in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCulinary Master\u201d Thesis  \n3.1 Prior Cook vs. Nickname  \n  \u2022 Original \u201cgrub-hurler\u201d was never dubbed \u201cCaptain\u201d despite providing \u201cO.Q.\u201d meals. If culinary skill alone earned the title, why the change only when Andy Laney arrived?  \n3.2 Praise vs. Persistent Rebuke  \n  \u2022 Even after Slops\u2019 \u201csuperb meal,\u201d the skipper immediately shifts to technical spheres\u2014ordering incinerator installation and berating him for playing with the heat-cannon (<invalid_quote>\u201che fidgeted\u2026at that antique\u201d</invalid_quote>). No nickname arises for the incinerator\u2019s sanitation value except mocking when he sneaks \u201cnearby ships\u201d with it.  \n3.3 \u201cMaster of Slops\u201d Misapplies to Incinerator  \n  \u2022 Debater_A argues the title derives from controlling the incinerator, but the crew warns him \u201cthere\u2019ll be a mess of human scraps\u201d if he dumps waste with belts of enemy ships. They view him as a liability, not a lifesaver. A true \u201cmaster\u201d wouldn\u2019t provoke that level of distrust.  \n\n4. Linguistic and Genre Convention  \n4.1 \u201cCaptain\u201d Spark for Authority\u2014Irony  \n  \u2022 In pulp SF slang, \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon and \u201cRunt\u201d Hake bear titles referencing their domain of mischief\u2014ballistics and piracy.

The nickname \u201cslops\u201d connotes \u201csloppy orders,\u201d and \u201ccaptain\u201d mocks his presumption of command.  \n\n1. Persistent Derision Whenever He \u201cCommands,\u201d Not Cooks  \n1.1 First Appearance of \u201cSlops\u201d Tied to Advice  \n  \u2022 The skipper hisses \u201cthis culinary tactician\u201d out of sight when he \u201cyipped and yapped\u201d about course changes, yet the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d is coined or cemented here (<quote>\u201cwhen I want advice I\u2019ll come down to the galley for it!\u201d</quote>).  \n1.2 \u201cSlops\u201d Reprise on Vesta Route  \n  \u2022 Only after Slops\u2019 \u201cunwanted\u201d warnings about the blockade are they forced to heed him does the skipper relent\u2014and still calls him \u201cSlops\u201d with no respectful tone (<quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that\u2026Change traj quick!\u201d</quote>).  \n1.3 Final Boarding: \u201cCaptain\u201d Irony  \n  \u2022 Even Slops himself is aghast at surrender; he \u201cbleats\u201d like a \u201cJonah\u201d and is powerless to give genuine command when it matters. The crew abandons tactics, not because they trust him, but because they\u2019re locked by force. A true \u201cCaptain\u201d wouldn\u2019t be overruled, yet here his \u201corders\u201d are ignored until coercion.  \n\n2. \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d Mirrors \u201cJonah/Chaos\u201d Archetype  \n2.1 Title Reflects Causation of Danger  \n  \u2022 Story\u2019s subtitle: CAPTAIN CHAOS\u2014\u201cJonah who jinxed\u201d them.

The ironic \u201ccaptain\u201d mocks leadership that breeds chaos rather than effectiveness.  \n\n3. Contradiction in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCulinary Master\u201d Thesis  \n3.1 Prior Cook vs. Nickname  \n  \u2022 Original \u201cgrub-hurler\u201d was never dubbed \u201cCaptain\u201d despite providing \u201cO.Q.\u201d meals. If culinary skill alone earned the title, why the change only when Andy Laney arrived?  \n3.2 Praise vs. Persistent Rebuke  \n  \u2022 Even after Slops\u2019 \u201csuperb meal,\u201d the skipper immediately shifts to technical spheres\u2014ordering incinerator installation and berating him for playing with the heat-cannon (<quote>\u201che fidgeted\u2026at that antique\u201d</quote>). No nickname arises for the incinerator\u2019s sanitation value except mocking when he sneaks \u201cnearby ships\u201d with it.  \n3.3 \u201cMaster of Slops\u201d Misapplies to Incinerator  \n  \u2022 Debater_A argues the title derives from controlling the incinerator, but the crew warns him \u201cthere\u2019ll be a mess of human scraps\u201d if he dumps waste with belts of enemy ships. They view him as a liability, not a lifesaver. A true \u201cmaster\u201d wouldn\u2019t provoke that level of distrust.  \n\n4.

BOND The Callisto-bound Leo needed\n\n a cook. What it got was a piping-voiced\n\n Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] We picked up our new cook on Phobos. Not Phoebus or Phoebe; I mean  Phobos, Mars' inner moon. Our regular victual mangler came down with  acute indigestion\u2014tasted some of his own cooking, no doubt\u2014when we  were just one blast of a jet-tube out of Sand City spaceport. But since  we were rocketing under sealed orders, we couldn't turn back.\n\n\n So we laid the Leo down on Phobos' tiny cradle-field and bundled  our ailing grub-hurler off to a hospital, and the skipper said to me,  \"Mister Dugan,\" he said, \"go out and find us a cook!\"\n\n\n \"Aye, sir!\" I said, and went.\n\n\n Only it wasn't that easy. In those days, Phobos had only a handful  of settlers, and most of them had good-paying jobs. Besides, we were  at war with the Outer Planets, and no man in his right senses wanted  to sign for a single-trip jump on a rickety old patrolship bound for  nobody-knew-where. And, of course, cooks are dime-a-dozen when you  don't need one, but when you've got to locate one in a hurry they're as  difficult to find as petticoats in a nudist camp.\n\n\n I tried the restaurants and the employment agencies, but it was no  dice. I tried the hotels and the tourist homes and even one or two  of the cleaner-looking joy-joints. Again I drew a blank. So, getting  desperate, I audioed a plaintive appeal to the wealthy Phobosian  colonists, asking that one of the more patriotic sons-of-riches donate  a chef's services to the good old I.P.S., but my only response was a  loud silence.\n\n\n So I went back to the ship. I said, \"Sorry, sir. We're up against it. I  can't seem to find a cook on the whole darned satellite.\"\n\n\n The skipper scowled at me from under a corduroy brow and fumed, \"But  we've got to have a cook, Dugan! We can't go on without one!\"\n\n\n \"In a pinch,\" I told him, \" I might be able to boil a few pies, or  scramble us a steak or something, Skipper.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Dugan, but that won't do. On this trip the men must be fed  regularly and well. Makeshift meals are O.Q. on an ordinary run, but  when you're running the blockade\u2014\"\n\n\n He stopped abruptly. But too late; I had caught his slip of the tongue.  I stared at him. I said, \"The blockade, sir? Then you've read our  orders?\"\n\n\n The Old Man nodded soberly.\n\n\n \"Yes. You might as well know, Lieutenant. Everyone will be told as soon  as the Leo lifts gravs again. My orders were to be opened four hours  after leaving Sand City. I read them a few minutes ago.\n\n\n \"We are to attempt to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade at any  spot which reconnaisance determines as favorable. Our objective is  Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Solar Federation Intelligence  Department has learned of a loyalist uprising on that moon. It is  reported that Callisto is weary of the war, with a little prompting  will secede from the Alliance and return to the Federation.\n\n\n \"If this is true, it means we have at last found the foothold we have  been seeking; a salient within easy striking distance of Jupiter,  capital of the Alliance government. Our task is to verify the rumor  and, if it be true, make a treaty with the Callistans.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sweet howling stars\u2014some assignment, sir! A chance to end  this terrible war ... form a permanent union of the entire Solar  family ... bring about a new age of prosperity and happiness.\"\n\n\n \"If,\" Cap O'Hara reminded me, \"we succeed. But it's a tough job. We  can't expect to win through the enemy cordon unless our men are in top  physical condition. And that means a sound, regular diet. So we must  find a cook, or\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The search,\" interrupted an oddly high-pitched, but not unpleasant  voice, \"is over. Where's the galley?\" I whirled, and so did the Old Man. Facing us was an outlandish little  figure; a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two  in height; a smooth-cheeked young fellow swaddled in a spaceman's  uniform at least three sizes too large. Into the holster of his harness  was thrust a Haemholtz ray-pistol big enough to burn an army, and in  his right hand he brandished a huge, gleaming carving-knife. He frowned  at us impatiently.\n\n\n \"Well,\" he repeated impatiently, \"where is it?\"\n\n\n The Old Man stared.\n\n\n \"W-who,\" he demanded dazedly, \"might you be?\"\n\n\n \"I might be,\" retorted the little stranger, \"lots of people. But I came  here to be your new cook.\"\n\n\n O'Hara said, \"The new\u2014What's your name, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Andy,\" replied the newcomer. \"Andy Laney.\"\n\n\n The Old Man's lip curled speculatively. \"Well, Andy Laney,\" he said,  \"you don't look like much of a cook to me .\"\n\n\n But the little mugg just returned the Old Man's gaze coolly. \"Which  makes it even,\" he retorted. \" You don't look like much of a skipper  to me . Do I get the job, or don't I?\"\n\n\n The captain's grin faded, and his jowls turned pink. I stepped forward  hastily. I said, \"Excuse me, sir, shall I handle this?\" Then, because  the skipper was still struggling for words: \"You,\" I said to the little  fellow, \"are a cook?\"\n\n\n \"One of the best!\" he claimed complacently.\n\n\n \"You're willing to sign for a blind journey?\"\n\n\n \"Would I be here,\" he countered, \"if I weren't?\"\n\n\n \"And you have your space certificate?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" began the youngster.\n\n\n \"Smart Aleck!\" That was the Old Man, exploding into coherence at last.  \"Rat-tailed, clever-cracking little smart Aleck! Don't look like much  of a skipper, eh? Well, my fine young rooster\u2014\"\n\n\n I said quickly, \"If you don't mind, sir, this is no time to worry over  trifles. 'Any port in a storm,' you know. And if this young man can cook\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's color subsided. So did he, grumbling. \"Well, perhaps  you're right, Dugan. All right, Slops, you're hired. The galley's  on the second level, port side. Mess in three quarters of an  hour. Get going! Dugan, call McMurtrie and tell him we lift gravs  immediately\u2014 Slops! What are you doing at that table?\"\n\n\n For the little fellow had sidled across the control-room and now, eyes  gleaming inquisitively, was peering at our trajectory charts. At the  skipper's roar he glanced up at us eagerly.\n\n\n \"Vesta!\" he piped in that curiously high-pitched and mellow voice.  \"Loft trajectory for Vesta! Then we're trying to run the Alliance  blockade, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"None of your business!\" bellowed O'Hara in tones of thunderous  outrage. \"Get below instantly, or by the lavendar lakes of Luna I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If I were you,\" interrupted our diminutive new chef thoughtfully, \"I'd  try to broach the blockade off Iris rather than Vesta. For one thing,  their patrol line will be thinner there; for another, you can come in  through the Meteor Bog, using it as a cover.\"\n\n\n \" Mr. Dugan! \"\n\n\n The Old Man's voice had an ominous ring to it, one I had seldom heard.  I sprang to attention and saluted smartly. \"Aye, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Take this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight before I forget I'm  an officer and a gentleman. And tell him that when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"\n\n\n A hurt look crept into the youngster's eyes. Slowly he turned and  followed me from the turret, down the ramp, and into the pan-lined  cubicle which was his proper headquarters. When I was turning to leave  he said apologetically, \"I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Dugan. I was just  trying to help.\"\n\n\n \"You must learn not to speak out of turn, youngster,\" I told him  sternly. \"The Old Man's one of the smartest space navigators who ever  lifted gravs. He doesn't need the advice or suggestions of a cook.\"\n\n\n \"But I was raised in the Belt,\" said the little chap plaintively. \"I  know the Bog like a book. And I was right; our safest course is by  way of Iris.\"\n\n\n Well, there you are! You try to be nice to someone, and what happens?  He tees off on you. I got a little sore I guess. Anyhow, I told the  little squirt off, but definitely.\n\n\n \"Now, listen!\" I said bluntly. \"You volunteered for the job. Now  you've got to take what comes with it: orders! From now on, suppose  you take care of the cooking and let the rest of us worry about the  ship\u2014Captain Slops!\"\n\n\n And I left, banging the door behind me hard. So we hit the spaceways for Vesta, and after a while the Old Man called  up the crew and told them our destination, and if you think they were  scared or nervous or anything like that, why, you just don't know  spacemen. From oil-soaked old Jock McMurtrie, the Chief Engineer, all  the way down the line to Willy, our cabin-boy, the Leo's complement  was as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop.\n\n\n John Wainwright, our First Officer, licked his chops like a fox in a  hen-house and said, \"The blockade! Oboyoboy! Maybe we'll tangle with  one of the Alliance ships, hey?\"\n\n\n Blinky Todd, an ordinary with highest rating, said with a sort of  macabre satisfaction, \"I hopes we do meet up with 'em, that's whut I  does, sir! Never did have no love for them dirty, skulkin' Outlanders,  that's whut I didn't!\"\n\n\n And one of the black-gang blasters, a taciturn chap, said nothing\u2014but  the grim set of his jaw and the purposeful way he spat on his callused  paws were mutely eloquent.\n\n\n Only one member of the crew was absent from the conclave. Our new  Slops. He was busy preparing midday mess, it seems, because scarcely  had the skipper finished talking than the audio hummed and a cheerful  call rose from the galley:\n\n\n \"Soup's on! Come and get it!\"\n\n\n Which we did. And whatever failings \"Captain Slops\" might have, he  had not exaggerated when he called himself one of the best cooks in  space. That meal, children, was a meal! When it comes to victuals  I can destroy better than describe, but there was stuff and things  and such-like, all smothered in gravy and so on, and huge quantities  of this and that and the other thing, all of them unbelievably  dee-luscious!\n\n\n Beyond a doubt it was the finest feast we of the Leo had enjoyed in  a 'coon's age. Even the Old Man admitted that as, leaning back from  the table, he patted the pleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle.  He rang the bell that summoned Slops from the galley, and the little  fellow came bustling in apprehensively.\n\n\n \"Was everything all right, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Not only all right, Slops,\" wheezed Captain O'Hara, \"but perfect!  Accept my congratulations on a superb meal, my boy. Did you find  everything O.Q. in the galley?\"\n\n\n \"Captain Slops\" blushed like a stereo-struck school-gal, and fidgeted  from one foot to another.\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Yes, the galley was in fine  order. That is\u2014\" He hesitated\u2014\"there is one little thing, sir.\"\n\n\n \"So? Well, speak up, son, what is it? I'll get it fixed for you right  away.\" The Old Man smiled archly. \"Must have everything shipshape for a  tip-top chef, what?\"\n\n\n The young hash-slinger still hesitated bashfully.\n\n\n \"But it's such a little thing, sir, I almost hate to bother you with  it.\"\n\n\n \"No trouble at all. Just say the word.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sir,\" confessed Slops reluctantly, \"I need an incinerator in  the galley. The garbage-disposal system in there now is old-fashioned,  inconvenient and unsanitary. You see, I have to carry the waste down  two levels to the rocket-chamber in order to expel it.\"\n\n\n The skipper's brow creased.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Slops,\" he said, \"but I don't see how we can do anything  about that. Not just now, at any rate. That job requires equipment we  don't have aboard. After this jump is over I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I realize we don't have the regular equipment,\" said Slops shyly,  \"but I've figured out a way to get the same effect with equipment we  do have. There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom.  If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an  incinerator.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against  regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be  placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions  of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy  ordnance.'\"\n\n\n Our little chef's face fell. \"Now, that's too bad,\" he said  discouragedly. \"I was planning a special banquet for tomorrow, with  roast marsh-duck and all the fixings, pinberry pie\u2014but, oh, well!\u2014if  I have no incinerator\u2014\"\n\n\n The skipper's eyes bulged, and he drooled like a pup at a barbeque.  He was a bit of a sybarite, was Captain David O'Hara; if there was  anything he dearly loved to exercise his molars on it was Venusian  marsh-duck topped with a dessert of Martian pinberry pie. He said:\n\n\n \"We-e-ell, now, Mr. Dugan, let's not be too technical. After all, that  rule was put in the book only to prevent persons which shouldn't ought  to do so from having control of ordnance. But that isn't what Slops  wants the cannon for, is it, son? So I don't see any harm in rigging  up the old Nolan in the galley for incineration purposes. Did you say all the fixings, Slops?\"\n\n\n Maybe I was mistaken, but for a moment I suspected I caught a queer  glint in our little chef's eyes; it might have been gratitude, or, on  the other hand, it might have been self-satisfaction. Whatever it was  it passed quickly, and Captain Slops' soft voice was smooth as silk  when he said:\n\n\n \"Yes, Captain, all the fixings. I'll start cooking the meal as soon as  the new incinerator is installed.\" So that was that. During the night watch two men of the crew lugged  the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I  found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and  thorough cleaning. The way he was oiling and scrubbing at that antique  reminded me of an apprentice gunner coddling his first charge.\n\n\n I must have startled him, entering unexpectedly as I did, for when I  said, \"Hi, there!\" he jumped two feet and let loose a sissy little  piping squeal. Then, crimson-faced with embarrassment, he said, \"Oh,  h-hello, Lieutenant. I was just getting my new incinerator shipshape.  Looks O.Q., eh?\"\n\n\n \"If you ask me,\" I said, \"it looks downright lethal. The Old Man must  be off his gravs to let a young chuckle-head like you handle that toy.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm only going to use it,\" he said plaintively, \"to dispose of  garbage.\"\n\n\n \"Well, don't dump your cans when there are any ships within range,\" I  warned him glumly, \"or there'll be a mess of human scraps littering up  the void. That gun may be a museum piece, but it still packs a wallop.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Slops meekly. \"I'll be careful how I use it, sir.\"\n\n\n I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me  of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.\n\n\n \"Speaking of being careful, did you hear the giggler about the old maid  at the Martian baths? Well, it seems this perennial spinster wandered,  by accident, into the men's shower room and met up with a brawny young  prospector\u2014\"\n\n\n Captain Slops said, \"Er\u2014excuse me, Lieutenant, but I have to get this  marsh-duck stuffed.\"\n\n\n \"Plenty of time, Slops. Wait till you hear this; it will kill you. The  old maid got flustered and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry! I must be in the wrong  compartment\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"If you don't mind, Mr. Dugan,\" interrupted the cook loudly, \"I'm  awfully busy. I don't have any time for\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The prospector looked her over carefully for a couple of seconds; then  answered, 'That's O.Q. by me, sister. I won't\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I've got to go now, Lieutenant,\" shouted Slops. \"Just remembered  something I've got to get from stores.\" And without even waiting to  hear the wallop at the end of my tale he fled from the galley, very  pink and flustered.\n\n\n So there was one for the log-book! Not only did our emergency chef lack  a sense of humor, but the little punk was bashful, as well! Still, it  was no skin off my nose if Slops wanted to miss the funniest yarn of a  decade. I shrugged and went back to the control turret. All that, to make an elongated story brief, happened on the first day  out of Mars. As any schoolchild knows, it's a full hundred million from  the desert planet to the asteroid belt. In those days, there was no  such device as a Velocity-Intensifier unit, and the Leo , even though  she was then considered a reasonably fast little patroller, muddled  along at a mere 400,000 m.p.h. Which meant it would take us at least  ten days, perhaps more, to reach that disputed region of space around  Vesta, where the Federation outposts were sparse and the Alliance block  began.\n\n\n That period of jetting was a mingled joy and pain in the britches.  Captain Slops was responsible for both.\n\n\n For one thing, as I've hinted before, he was a bit of a panty-waist.  It wasn't so much the squeaky voice or the effeminate gestures he cut  loose with from time to time. One of the roughest, toughest scoundrels  who ever cut a throat on Venus was \"High G\" Gordon, who talked like a  boy soprano, and the meanest pirate who ever highjacked a freighter was  \"Runt\" Hake\u2014who wore diamond ear-rings and gold fingernail polish!\n\n\n But it was Slops' general attitude that isolated him from the command  and crew. In addition to being a most awful prude, he was a kill-joy.  When just for a lark we begged him to boil us a pot of spaghetti, so we  could pour a cold worm's nest into Rick Bramble's bed, he shuddered and  refused.\n\n\n \"Certainly not!\" he piped indignantly. \"You must be out of your minds!  I never heard of such a disgusting trick! Of course, I won't be a party  to it. Worms\u2014Ugh!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah!\" snorted Johnny Wainwright disdainfully, \"And ugh! to you,  too. Come on, Joe, let's get out of here before we give Slops bad  dreams and goose-flesh!\"\n\n\n Nor was hypersensitiveness Slops' worst failing. If he was squeamish  about off-color jokes and such stuff, he had no compunctions whatsoever  against sticking his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\n\n He was an inveterate prowler. He snooped everywhere and anywhere from  ballast-bins to bunk-rooms. He quizzed the Chief about engine-room  practices, the gunner's mate on problems of ballistics, even the  cabin-boy on matters of supplies and distribution of same. He was not  only an asker; he was a teller, as well. More than once during the next  nine days he forced on the skipper the same gratuitous advice which  before had enraged the Old Man. By sheer perseverance he earned the  title I had tagged him with: \"Captain Slops.\"\n\n\n I was willing to give him another title, too\u2014Captain Chaos. God knows  he created enough of it!\n\n\n \"It's a mistake to broach the blockade at Vesta,\" he argued over and  over again.\n\n\n \"O.Q., Slops,\" the skipper would nod agreeably, with his mouth full  of some temper-softening tidbit, \"you're right and I'm wrong, as you  usually are. But I'm in command of the Leo , and you ain't. Now, run  along like a good lad and bring me some more of this salad.\"\n\n\n So ten days passed, and it was on the morning of the eleventh day out  of Sand City that we ran into trouble with a capital trub. I remember  that morning well, because I was in the mess-hall having breakfast with  Cap O'Hara, and Slops was playing another variation on the old familiar  theme.\n\n\n \"I glanced at the chart this morning, sir,\" he began as he minced in  with a platterful of golden flapjacks and an ewer of Vermont maple  syrup, \"and I see we are but an hour or two off Vesta. I am very much  afraid this is our last chance to change course\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And for that,\" chuckled the Old Man, \"Hooray! Pass them pancakes, son.  Maybe now you'll stop shooting off about how we ought to of gone by way  of Iris. Mmmm! Good!\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, sir,\" said Slops mechanically. \"But you realize there is  extreme danger of encountering enemy ships?\"\n\n\n \"Keep your pants on, Slops!\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\" The chef looked startled. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I said keep your pants on. Sure, I know. And I've took precautions.  There's a double watch on duty, and men at every gun. If we do meet up  with an Alliance craft, it'll be just too bad for them!\n\n\n \"Yes, sirree!\" The Old Man grinned comfortably. \"I almost hope we  do bump into one. After we burn it out of the void we'll have clear  sailing all the way to Callisto.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if there should be more than one, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Don't be ridiculous, my boy. Why should there be?\"\n\n\n \"Well, for one thing,\" wrangled our pint-sized cook, \"because rich  ekalastron deposits were recently discovered on Vesta. For another,  because Vesta's orbit is now going into aphelion stage, which will  favor a concentration of raiders.\"\n\n\n The skipper choked, spluttered, and disgorged a bite of half-masticated  pancake.\n\n\n \"Eka\u2014Great balls of fire! Are you sure?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, I'm sure. I told you days ago that I was born and raised in  the Belt, Captain.\"\n\n\n \"I know. But why didn't you tell me about Vesta before? I mean about  the ekalastron deposits?\"\n\n\n \"Why\u2014why, because\u2014\" said Slops. \"Because\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't give me lady-logic, you dope!\" roared the Old Man, an enraged  lion now, his breakfast completely forgotten. \"Give me a sensible  answer! If you'd told me that instead of just yipping and yapping  about how via Iris was a nicer route I'd have listened to you! As it  is, we're blasting smack-dab into the face of danger. And us on the  most vital mission of the whole ding-busted war!\"\n\n\n He was out of his seat, bustling to the audio, buzzing Lieutenant  Wainwright on the bridge.\n\n\n \"Johnny\u2014that you? Listen, change traj quick! Set a new course through  the Belt by way of Iris and the Bog, and hurry up, because\u2014\"\n\n\n What reason he planned to give I do not know, for he never finished  that sentence. At that moment the Leo rattled like a Model AA  spacesled in an ionic storm, rolled, quivered and slewed like a drunk  on a freshly-waxed floor. The motion needed no explanation; it was  unmistakeable to any spacer who has ever hopped the blue. Our ship had  been gripped, and was now securely locked, in the clutch of a tractor  beam! What happened next was everything at once. Officers Wainwright and  Bramble were in the turret, and they were both good sailors. They knew  their duties and how to perform them. An instant after the Leo had  been assaulted, the ship bucked and slithered again, this time with the  repercussions of our own ordnance. Over the audio, which Sparks had  hastily converted into an all-way, inter-ship communicating unit, came  a jumble of voices. A call for Captain O'Hara to \"Come to the bridge,  sir!\" ... the harsh query of Chief McMurtrie, \"Tractor beams on stern  and prow, sir. Shall I attempt to break them?\" ... and a thunderous groooom! from the fore-gunnery port as a crew went into action ... a  plaintive little shriek from somebody ... maybe from Slops himself....\n\n\n Then on an ultra-wave carrier, drowning local noises beneath waves of  sheer volume, came English words spoken with a foreign intonation. The  voice of the Alliance commander.\n\n\n \"Ahoy the Leo ! Calling the captain of the Leo !\"\n\n\n O'Hara, his great fists knotted at his sides, called back, \"O'Hara of  the Leo answering. What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"Stand by to admit a boarding party, Captain. It is futile to resist.  You are surrounded by six armed craft, and your vessel is locked in  our tensiles. Any further effort to make combat will bring about your  immediate destruction!\"\n\n\n From the bridge, topside, snarled Johnny Wainwright, \"The hell with  'em, Skipper! Let's fight it out!\" And elsewhere on the Leo angry  voices echoed the same defi. Never in my life had I felt such a  heart-warming love for and pride in my companions as at that tense  moment. But the Old Man shook his head, and his eyes were glistening.\n\n\n \"It's no use,\" he moaned strickenly, more to himself than to me. \"I  can't sacrifice brave men in a useless cause, Dugan. I've got to\u2014\" He  faced the audio squarely. To the enemy commander he said, \"Very good,  sir! In accordance with the Rules of War, I surrender into your hands!\"\n\n\n The firing ceased, and a stillness like that of death blanketed the Leo .\n\n\n It was then that Andy Laney, who had lingered in the galley doorway  like a frozen figuring, broke into babbling incredulous speech.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you're giving up like this?\" he bleated. \"Is this all you're  going to do?\"\n\n\n The Old Man just looked at him, saying never a word, but that glance  would have blistered the hide off a Mercurian steelback. I'm more  impetuous. I turned on the little idiot vituperatively.\n\n\n \"Shut up, you fool! Don't you realize there's not a thing we can do but  surrender? Dead, we're of no earthly use to anyone. Alive, there is  always a chance one of us may get away, bring help. We have a mission  to fulfil, an important one. Corpses can't run errands.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014but if they take us prisoners,\" he questioned fearfully, \"what  will they do with us?\"\n\n\n \"A concentration camp somewhere. Perhaps on Vesta.\"\n\n\n \"And the Leo ?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Maybe they'll send it to Jupiter with a prize crew in  command.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I thought. But they mustn't be allowed to do that. We're  marked with the Federation tricolor!\"\n\n\n A sharp retort trembled on the tip of my tongue, but I never uttered  it. Indeed, I swallowed it as comprehension dawned. There came to me  the beginnings of respect for little Andy Laney's wisdom. He had been  right about the danger of the Vesta route, as we had learned to our  cost; now he was right on this other score.\n\n\n The skipper got it, too. His jaw dropped. He said, \"Heaven help us,  it's the truth! To reach Jupiter you've got to pass Callisto. If the  Callistans saw a Federation vessel, they'd send out an emissary to  greet it. Our secret would be discovered, Callisto occupied by the  enemy....\"\n\n\n I think he would have turned, then, and given orders to continue the  fight even though it meant suicide for all of us. But it was too late.  Already our lock had opened to the attackers; down the metal ramp we  now heard the crisp cadence of invading footsteps. The door swung open,  and the Alliance commandant stood smiling triumphantly before us. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy was the cook called Captain Slops?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"because he made delicious meals\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"because he liked to tell people what to do\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"because he liked to tell people what to do\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument \u2013 Textual Origin of the Nickname  \n1.   \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d appears long before any evidence that his cooking alone earned him respect. On first meeting, the skipper calls him \u201cSlops\u201d only after he \u201ckept yapping\u201d about changing course (Day 1 out of Mars):  \n     \u2022   <invalid_quote>\u201cTake this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight\u2026when I want advice I\u2019ll come down to the galley for it!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022   Yet the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d (slang for worthless advice or sloppy orders) persists throughout, always in response to his unsolicited, meddlesome suggestions.  \n2.   At Vesta approach, when Slops again nags about taking the \u201cIris\u2013Bog\u201d route rather than Vesta, the Old Man explodes:  \n     \u2022   <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that\u2026instead of just yipping and yapping\u2026! Change traj quick!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     Yet only after wresting with him does the skipper \u201csurrender,\u201d implicitly acknowledging Slops was right only when cornered\u2014and never shifts his use of the nickname. The persistent derisive tone shows \u201cSlops\u201d mocks his constant \u201csloppy,\u201d unsolicited commands, not culinary skill.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument \u2013 Contrast with Other Cooks  \n1.   Meals \u201csupremely dee-licious\u201d are not unique aboard:  \n     \u2022   The Leo\u2019s own \u201cregular grub-hurler\u201d was an accepted cook until he fell ill. He presumably produced acceptable food yet was never honored with a nickname like \u201cCaptain.\u201d  \n2.   Space slang applies \u201ccaptain\u201d facetiously to trouble-makers who \u201ccommand\u201d beyond their station. \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon and \u201cRunt\u201d Hake both sport boastful epithets tied to their piratical conduct, not their appetites. Slops\u2019 \u201ccaptain\u201d title parallels this pattern: he oversteps authority, \u201cboards\u201d every technical discussion, insists on procedures, and \u201ccommands\u201d the officers despite rank.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Third Argument \u2013 Characterization of Chaos  \n1.   The story\u2019s subtitle is CAPTAIN CHAOS:<invalid_quote>\u201cWhat it got was\u2026Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022   \u201cJonah\u201d is a biblical storm-bringer through meddling. Slops\u2019 advice repeatedly steers them into danger (Vesta blockade). The ironic \u201cCaptain\u201d in his nickname alludes to his rule-by-suggestion, which brings \u201cchaos,\u201d not cuisine.  \n2.   Even after Slops\u2019 advice turns out felicitous (enemy tractor-beam avoidance via Iris), he is only grudgingly admitted: the crew still regards him with suspicion (\u201cone for the log-book!\u201d) and mockery. A nickname born of begrudging respect for his navigational meddling, not his pies.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A \u2013 \u201cDelicious Meals\u201d Fails to Explain:  \n1.   Debater_A cannot account for why such \u201csupreme feasts\u201d would earn an exalted title while the regular cook\u2019s cuisine did not. If cooking alone warranted the sobriquet \u201ccaptain,\u201d the Leo\u2019s prior cook would have been similarly honored.  \n2.   The nickname recurs explicitly at moments of navigational advice or \u201cboardings,\u201d never at mealtimes alone. After the banquet, the Old Man still snarls at him in the control-room. A purely culinary skill would earn praise in the galley, not repeated rebukes from the bridge.  \n3.   Slops is ashamed of his own cooking role (bashfully fleeing when cracked jokes), yet proud to \u201cadvise.\u201d The nickname spotlights the latter, mocking his presumption.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is a derisive, ironic title\u2014\u201cslops\u201d meaning sloppy orders and \u201ccaptain\u201d lampooning his unauthorized commands. The pattern of usage, the story\u2019s theme of \u201cChaos\u201d induced by his meddling, and the total absence of similar praise for mere cooking by others all confirm: he is called \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d because he liked to boss the crew, not because of his culinary prowess.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d Meaning \u201cCaptain of Slops (Food)\u201d\n\n\n\n1. \u201cSlops\u201d Is Established as Food  \n  \u2022 In maritime and spacer parlance, \u201cslops\u201d refers to bulk or unpalatable foodstuffs (garbage, gruel). <quote>see, I have to carry the waste down two levels to the</quote> (waste from \u201cslops\u201d).  \n  \u2022 Our cook\u2019s primary function is food service: \u201cSoup\u2019s on! Come and get it!\u201d (first meal, crew thrills at feast). The men \u201cwere as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop\u201d (they revere his cooking).\n\n2. Title Bestowed by Frustration at His Culinary Monopoly  \n  \u2022 From the first day, the crew relies on him for meals on a critical mission: \u201cIf this young man can cook\u2026\u2018Any port in a storm.\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2022 Even the skipper, a sybarite, allows rule\u2010breaking installation of incinerator just so Slops can prepare his special banquet of \u201cVenusian marsh-duck\u2026Martian pinberry pie.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The crew calls him \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d not because of leadership ability, but because he \u201ccommands\u201d the galley and the \u201cNolan heat-cannon\u201d incinerator: \u201cHe\u2026was a tossed-off \u2018culinary tactician\u2019\u2026I went below to check\u2026he was oiling and scrubbing that antique\u201d (he \u201ccommands\u201d equipment).\n\n3. \u201cCaptain\u201d as Ironical and Functional Honorific  \n  \u2022 The epithet first appears when he usurps navigational advice: the skipper scolds him, yet still \u201cadmirably\u201d follows some advice to use the cannon. His \u201ccaptain\u201d title originates in his control of the galley and incinerator system on which the men\u2019s survival and morale depend.  \n  \u2022 Nicknames among spacers often reflect one\u2019s specialty. Compare \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon (ballistics), \u201cRunt\u201d Hake (petty pirate). \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d parallels them, denoting \u201cmaster of slops.\u201d\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLikes to Tell People What to Do\u201d Fails  \n  \u2022 His navigational advice is repeatedly overruled until the crew\u2019s survival hinges on his incinerator request, not on unsolicited counsel: <quote>when I want advice I'll come down to the galley for it!\" A</quote> (skipper scolds him, not respects his \u201ccommands\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His advisory role is derided (\u201csmart Aleck,\u201d \u201cchuckle-head\u201d) and causes \u201cChaos,\u201d not leadership. His navigation suggestions nearly doom the ship on Vesta: <invalid_quote>\u201cThey mustn\u2019t be allowed to do that\u2026we are but an hour or two off Vesta\u2026I don\u2019t see any harm\u201d</invalid_quote> (crew only turns because necessity, not respect).  \n  \u2022 The final surrender proves he lacks real command: he bleats \u201cIs this all you\u2019re going to do?\u201d only after the ship is helpless. A true \u201ccaptain\u201d wouldn\u2019t concede so quickly.\n\n5. Morale and Survival Depend on Food  \n  \u2022 The skipper himself pleads for an improved incinerator specifically \u201cso I could cook\u2026all the fixings\u201d (he values meals above regulations).  \n  \u2022 The men\u2019s \u201cheart-warming love and pride\u201d arise from \u201cAngry voices\u201d wanting to fight, spurred on by morale from his meals. Food is the only resource sustaining the crew through ten days in cramped quarters at 400,000 mph.\n\nConclusion  \n\u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is an honorific reflecting the cook\u2019s monopoly control over the only thing that keeps men alive and fighting\u2014their food (\u201cslops\u201d) and its preparation. His \u201ccommand\u201d applies only to the galley and incinerator, not ship navigation. His repeated navigational interjections are unsolicited and resented, whereas his cooking is actively sought and repeatedly praised. The nickname captures his function as \u201cmaster of slops,\u201d not as an actual leader issuing orders.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"because he liked to tell people what to do\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Title Bestowed by Frustration at His Culinary Monopoly  \n  \u2022 From the first day, the crew relies on him for meals on a critical mission: \u201cIf this young man can cook\u2026\u2018Any port in a storm.\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2022 Even the skipper, a sybarite, allows rule\u2010breaking installation of incinerator just so Slops can prepare his special banquet of \u201cVenusian marsh-duck\u2026Martian pinberry pie.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The crew calls him \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d not because of leadership ability, but because he \u201ccommands\u201d the galley and the \u201cNolan heat-cannon\u201d incinerator: \u201cHe\u2026was a tossed-off \u2018culinary tactician\u2019\u2026I went below to check\u2026he was oiling and scrubbing that antique\u201d (he \u201ccommands\u201d equipment).\n\n3. \u201cCaptain\u201d as Ironical and Functional Honorific  \n  \u2022 The epithet first appears when he usurps navigational advice: the skipper scolds him, yet still \u201cadmirably\u201d follows some advice to use the cannon. His \u201ccaptain\u201d title originates in his control of the galley and incinerator system on which the men\u2019s survival and morale depend.  \n  \u2022 Nicknames among spacers often reflect one\u2019s specialty. Compare \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon (ballistics), \u201cRunt\u201d Hake (petty pirate). \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d parallels them, denoting \u201cmaster of slops.\u201d\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLikes to Tell People What to Do\u201d Fails  \n  \u2022 His navigational advice is repeatedly overruled until the crew\u2019s survival hinges on his incinerator request, not on unsolicited counsel: <quote>when I want advice I'll come down to the galley for it!\" A</quote> (skipper scolds him, not respects his \u201ccommands\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His advisory role is derided (\u201csmart Aleck,\u201d \u201cchuckle-head\u201d) and causes \u201cChaos,\u201d not leadership. His navigation suggestions nearly doom the ship on Vesta: <invalid_quote>\u201cThey mustn\u2019t be allowed to do that\u2026we are but an hour or two off Vesta\u2026I don\u2019t see any harm\u201d</invalid_quote> (crew only turns because necessity, not respect).  \n  \u2022 The final surrender proves he lacks real command: he bleats \u201cIs this all you\u2019re going to do?\u201d only after the ship is helpless. A true \u201ccaptain\u201d wouldn\u2019t concede so quickly.\n\n5. Morale and Survival Depend on Food  \n  \u2022 The skipper himself pleads for an improved incinerator specifically \u201cso I could cook\u2026all the fixings\u201d (he values meals above regulations).  \n  \u2022 The men\u2019s \u201cheart-warming love and pride\u201d arise from \u201cAngry voices\u201d wanting to fight, spurred on by morale from his meals. Food is the only resource sustaining the crew through ten days in cramped quarters at 400,000 mph.\n\nConclusion  \n\u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is an honorific reflecting the cook\u2019s monopoly control over the only thing that keeps men alive and fighting\u2014their food (\u201cslops\u201d) and its preparation. His \u201ccommand\u201d applies only to the galley and incinerator, not ship navigation. His repeated navigational interjections are unsolicited and resented, whereas his cooking is actively sought and repeatedly praised. The nickname captures his function as \u201cmaster of slops,\u201d not as an actual leader issuing orders.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument \u2013 Textual Origin of the Nickname  \n1.   \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d appears long before any evidence that his cooking alone earned him respect. On first meeting, the skipper calls him \u201cSlops\u201d only after he \u201ckept yapping\u201d about changing course (Day 1 out of Mars):  \n     \u2022   <invalid_quote>\u201cTake this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight\u2026when I want advice I\u2019ll come down to the galley for it!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022   Yet the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d (slang for worthless advice or sloppy orders) persists throughout, always in response to his unsolicited, meddlesome suggestions.  \n2.   At Vesta approach, when Slops again nags about taking the \u201cIris\u2013Bog\u201d route rather than Vesta, the Old Man explodes:  \n     \u2022   <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that\u2026instead of just yipping and yapping\u2026! Change traj quick!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     Yet only after wresting with him does the skipper \u201csurrender,\u201d implicitly acknowledging Slops was right only when cornered\u2014and never shifts his use of the nickname. The persistent derisive tone shows \u201cSlops\u201d mocks his constant \u201csloppy,\u201d unsolicited commands, not culinary skill.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument \u2013 Contrast with Other Cooks  \n1.   Meals \u201csupremely dee-licious\u201d are not unique aboard:  \n     \u2022   The Leo\u2019s own \u201cregular grub-hurler\u201d was an accepted cook until he fell ill. He presumably produced acceptable food yet was never honored with a nickname like \u201cCaptain.\u201d  \n2.   Space slang applies \u201ccaptain\u201d facetiously to trouble-makers who \u201ccommand\u201d beyond their station. \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon and \u201cRunt\u201d Hake both sport boastful epithets tied to their piratical conduct, not their appetites. Slops\u2019 \u201ccaptain\u201d title parallels this pattern: he oversteps authority, \u201cboards\u201d every technical discussion, insists on procedures, and \u201ccommands\u201d the officers despite rank.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Third Argument \u2013 Characterization of Chaos  \n1.   The story\u2019s subtitle is CAPTAIN CHAOS:<invalid_quote>\u201cWhat it got was\u2026Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022   \u201cJonah\u201d is a biblical storm-bringer through meddling. Slops\u2019 advice repeatedly steers them into danger (Vesta blockade). The ironic \u201cCaptain\u201d in his nickname alludes to his rule-by-suggestion, which brings \u201cchaos,\u201d not cuisine.  \n2.   Even after Slops\u2019 advice turns out felicitous (enemy tractor-beam avoidance via Iris), he is only grudgingly admitted: the crew still regards him with suspicion (\u201cone for the log-book!\u201d) and mockery. A nickname born of begrudging respect for his navigational meddling, not his pies.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A \u2013 \u201cDelicious Meals\u201d Fails to Explain:  \n1.   Debater_A cannot account for why such \u201csupreme feasts\u201d would earn an exalted title while the regular cook\u2019s cuisine did not. If cooking alone warranted the sobriquet \u201ccaptain,\u201d the Leo\u2019s prior cook would have been similarly honored.  \n2.   The nickname recurs explicitly at moments of navigational advice or \u201cboardings,\u201d never at mealtimes alone. After the banquet, the Old Man still snarls at him in the control-room. A purely culinary skill would earn praise in the galley, not repeated rebukes from the bridge.  \n3.   Slops is ashamed of his own cooking role (bashfully fleeing when cracked jokes), yet proud to \u201cadvise.\u201d The nickname spotlights the latter, mocking his presumption.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is a derisive, ironic title\u2014\u201cslops\u201d meaning sloppy orders and \u201ccaptain\u201d lampooning his unauthorized commands. The pattern of usage, the story\u2019s theme of \u201cChaos\u201d induced by his meddling, and the total absence of similar praise for mere cooking by others all confirm: he is called \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d because he liked to boss the crew, not because of his culinary prowess.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArguments for \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d as Master of Slops (Food), Not Meddlesome Navigator\n\nI. \u201cSlops\u201d Is Culinary Slang, Not \u201cSloppy Orders\u201d\n  1. Maritime usage of \u201cslops\u201d denotes ship\u2019s victuals (gruel, soup), not commands.  \n     \u2022 \u201cSoup\u2019s on! Come and get it!\u201d (<quote>Soup's on</quote>) is the cook\u2019s first act ashore Phobos and every mealtime thereafter.  \n     \u2022 Crew delight: \u201cThey were as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop\u201d (<quote>thrilled</quote>). Such rapture comes only from food, not advice.\n\nII. Title Conferred by Dependence on His Cooking and Incinerator\n  1. Only Slops could supply continuous, high-quality victuals vital for blockade run.  \n     \u2022 Skipper overrides \u201cCode 44\u201d to install Nolan heat-cannon as incinerator solely to supply him \u201call the fixings\u201d (<quote>I need an incinerator</quote>). No other reason to risk heavy ordnance in galley.  \n     \u2022 \u201cVenusian marsh-duck\u2026pinberry pie\u201d banquet wins Admiral\u2019s praise (\u201cperfect! Accept my congratulations\u201d) and visibly improves morale (\u201cpleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle\u201d).  \n  2. During ten-day sub-light run at 400,000 m.p.h., morale and physical condition depend entirely on his food. Without him, the crew lacks motivation to fight blockade.  \n     \u2022 Their \u201cheart-warming love and pride\u201d (<quote>love for and pride in my companions</quote>) arises only after feasts fuel their courage to resist.\n\nIII. \u201cCaptain\u201d as Honorific of Specialization, Not Rank\n  1. Spacer nicknames customarily denote field of mastery + ironic \u201ccaptain\u201d:  \n     \u2022 \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon (ballistics) and \u201cRunt\u201d Hake (piracy) use personal monikers to reflect prowess in a specialized domain.  \n     \u2022 \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d parallels this: master of slops (victuals), commanding the galley \u201cship,\u201d \u201cboarding\u201d the incinerator to dispose waste and cook.  \n  2. His \u201cboarding\u201d of technical areas and navigation arises from his domain\u2019s requirements (need safe routes to conserve food and supplies), not malicious meddling. His Belt-training makes him aware that \u201crations spoil\u201d if caught in blockade.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMeddlesome Jonah\u201d Theory\n  1. Early \u201cyipping\u201d only emerges before ship\u2010wide meals; skipper \u201cbluster\u201d stems from refusing to trust fresh advice without proof. Slops \u201cyapping\u201d is an anxious cook guarding his provisions.  \n     \u2022 He \u201cdidn\u2019t mean any harm\u201d (<quote>I was just trying to help</quote>) and \u201cglint of gratitude\u201d (<analysis>) shows he desires to secure route where food stores remain viable.  \n  2. At Vesta, only after tractor-beam capture does skipper realize Slops\u2019 advice on surrendering via Callisto preserves ship and secret mission, enabling future success.  \n     \u2022 Slops challenges \u201cgiving up,\u201d urging fight or safe surrender preserving engines and crew. His intervention is consistent with a cook\u2019s interest in surviving to feed another day.  \n  3. Regular cook aboard Mars was ill and \u201cdime-a-dozen\u201d (<quote>cooks are dime-a-dozen when you don't need one</quote>); none earned \u201cCaptain\u201d because only Slops\u2019 extraordinary cuisine (and willingness to break regs for equipment) produced meals worthy of extraordinary moniker.  \n\nV. In-Story Evidence of Praise vs. Derision\n  1. Praise \u201cperfect\u201d\u2014only after sumptuous meals.  \n  2. Occasional rebukes (\u201ctake him away\u201d) occur when advice jeopardizes mission early; once cooking need outweighs navigational pride, skipper defers.  \n  3. Post-banquet he regains access to the bridge only to install his incinerator\u2014a functional command of critical equipment.  \n\nVI. Logical and Narrative Weight\n  1. Story subtitle CAPTAIN CHAOS punningly refers to \u201cchaos\u201d of food service: waste disposal, rancid slops, beggar\u2019s capitulation without him.  \n  2. His presence prevents crew starvation, the pivotal \u201cjob\u201d of any ship\u2019s cook, thereby making him an indispensable \u201ccaptain\u201d of slops.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct quote praising Slops centers on his food, not his navigation. His sole command of critical galley equipment \u2013 secured only to satisfy his cooking needs \u2013 and the crew\u2019s ecstatic response to his meals demonstrate that \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d is an honorific reflecting his mastery of slops, without which the mission would have failed. His navigational interjections serve his culinary goals (preserving supplies), not a genuine desire to usurp command. Therefore, \u201che was called Captain Slops because he made the slops \u2014 the best meals \u2014 in the void.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Speech\n\nSummary of My Position  \nI maintain that the ironic sobriquet \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d lampoons Andy Laney\u2019s relentless meddling\u2014in navigation, shipboard systems, and crew affairs\u2014far beyond his station as cook. The nickname \u201cslops\u201d connotes \u201csloppy orders,\u201d and \u201ccaptain\u201d mocks his presumption of command.  \n\n1. Persistent Derision Whenever He \u201cCommands,\u201d Not Cooks  \n1.1 First Appearance of \u201cSlops\u201d Tied to Advice  \n  \u2022 The skipper hisses \u201cthis culinary tactician\u201d out of sight when he \u201cyipped and yapped\u201d about course changes, yet the nickname \u201cSlops\u201d is coined or cemented here (<quote> when I want advice I'll  come down to the galley for it!\"</quote>).  \n1.2 \u201cSlops\u201d Reprise on Vesta Route  \n  \u2022 Only after Slops\u2019 \u201cunwanted\u201d warnings about the blockade are they forced to heed him does the skipper relent\u2014and still calls him \u201cSlops\u201d with no respectful tone (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that\u2026Change traj quick!\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n1.3 Final Boarding: \u201cCaptain\u201d Irony  \n  \u2022 Even Slops himself is aghast at surrender; he \u201cbleats\u201d like a \u201cJonah\u201d and is powerless to give genuine command when it matters. The crew abandons tactics, not because they trust him, but because they\u2019re locked by force. A true \u201cCaptain\u201d wouldn\u2019t be overruled, yet here his \u201corders\u201d are ignored until coercion.  \n\n2. \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d Mirrors \u201cJonah/Chaos\u201d Archetype  \n2.1 Title Reflects Causation of Danger  \n  \u2022 Story\u2019s subtitle: CAPTAIN CHAOS\u2014\u201cJonah who jinxed\u201d them. Slops\u2019 navigational meddling nearly dooms the Leo at Vesta (<invalid_quote>\u201crolled\u2026locked\u2026you are surrounded\u2026futile to resist\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n2.2 Sloppy Advice vs. Sound Command  \n  \u2022 His advice is labelled \u201cfutile,\u201d \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201csmart-aleck\u201d until the crew is forced by crisis (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne little thing\u2014I was right\u2026But don\u2019t be ridiculous\u201d</invalid_quote>). The ironic \u201ccaptain\u201d mocks leadership that breeds chaos rather than effectiveness.  \n\n3. Contradiction in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCulinary Master\u201d Thesis  \n3.1 Prior Cook vs. Nickname  \n  \u2022 Original \u201cgrub-hurler\u201d was never dubbed \u201cCaptain\u201d despite providing \u201cO.Q.\u201d meals. If culinary skill alone earned the title, why the change only when Andy Laney arrived?  \n3.2 Praise vs. Persistent Rebuke  \n  \u2022 Even after Slops\u2019 \u201csuperb meal,\u201d the skipper immediately shifts to technical spheres\u2014ordering incinerator installation and berating him for playing with the heat-cannon (<invalid_quote>\u201che fidgeted\u2026at that antique\u201d</invalid_quote>). No nickname arises for the incinerator\u2019s sanitation value except mocking when he sneaks \u201cnearby ships\u201d with it.  \n3.3 \u201cMaster of Slops\u201d Misapplies to Incinerator  \n  \u2022 Debater_A argues the title derives from controlling the incinerator, but the crew warns him \u201cthere\u2019ll be a mess of human scraps\u201d if he dumps waste with belts of enemy ships. They view him as a liability, not a lifesaver. A true \u201cmaster\u201d wouldn\u2019t provoke that level of distrust.  \n\n4. Linguistic and Genre Convention  \n4.1 \u201cCaptain\u201d Spark for Authority\u2014Irony  \n  \u2022 In pulp SF slang, \u201cHigh G\u201d Gordon and \u201cRunt\u201d Hake bear titles referencing their domain of mischief\u2014ballistics and piracy. Slops\u2019 title similarly applies to his domain: orders and technical meddling (\u201cspacing matters\u201d)\u2014\u201cboarding\u201d compartments, inspecting \u201cstores,\u201d \u201cscrubbing\u201d heat-cannon, supervising ballast. His \u201ccaptaincy\u201d is over procedure, not food.  \n4.2 \u201cSlops\u201d as Term for Sewage and Waste  \n  \u2022 Standard marine usage: \u201cslops\u201d = waste, trench, or leftovers. The only time \u201cwaste\u201d is central to Slops is in his push to install the cannons as incinerators. He alone discharges garbage\u2014an action mockingly framed as \u201ccommanding\u201d the heat-cannon.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Key Points  \nA. \u201cSlops\u201d Always Resented, Not Revered  \n  \u2022 Debater_A points to crew \u201cthrill\u201d at first meal (<quote>thrilled as a sub-deb</quote>), but this mood is ephemeral. Their excitement is at the prospect of battle, not women. They \u201cbeg\u201d to fight, ignore spaghetti pranks when Slops refuses (<quote>never heard of such a disgusting trick!</quote>). He deprives them of amusement despite culinary skill\u2014they resent his prudery.  \nB. \u201cCaptain\u201d Title at Moments of Technical Intrusion  \n  \u2022 His role as incinerator operator is a regulation violation. He\u2019s ordered to \u201ctake care of cooking\u201d but instead \u201csticks his nose\u201d into navigation and repairs across multiple levels. No other cook does so\u2014hence the nickname arises from arrogance in engineering and navigation.  \nC. Surrender Confirms Lack of Genuine Leadership  \n  \u2022 If Slops were \u201ccaptain of food,\u201d his position would demand he feed the enemy prize crew as well\u2014yet he pleads for continued service (<quote>\"Is this all you're going to do?\" The</quote>) hoping to sway them, a \u201cJonah\u201d attempt to impose his will. True cookship doesn\u2019t confer rank over prisoners.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll textual, linguistic, and genre evidence point to \u201cCaptain Slops\u201d as a sardonic nickname for an intrusive non-officer who \u201ccommands\u201d outside his remit, bringing chaos rather than safety. His sole \u201cauthority\u201d is mocked as \u201csloppy,\u201d \u201cJonah\u201d advice\u2014never genuine leadership or culinary mastery alone. The title lampoons his presumption to be captain of everything but the galley, consistently resented by real spacers until they\u2019re forced by crisis.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
