They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell.

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Close by\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Close by\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Dead\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Dead\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Close by\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A Position)  \nThesis: When Westover first recollects Sutton\u2019s speech while on the monster\u2019s back, the speaker (Sutton) is not dead but is nearby\u2014part of an active human colony inside the same monster.  \n\n1. Evidence of Real Voices from Beneath, Not Mere Memory  \n  a. Westover hears two kinds of voices: \u201csmall close ones that sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even called his name,\u201d and \u201cdistant muffled voices whose words he could not make out\u201d (quote).  \n     \u2022 The \u201csmall close\u201d voices occurring \u201cin the hot middays\u201d are too localized and tangible to be mere dreams. They repeatedly call his name as if waiting for him to enter.  \n     \u2022 \u201cDistant muffled voices\u201d implies depth and enclosure, consistent with voices carried through tunnels in the monster. Pure memory would have no spatial muffling characteristic.  \n\n2. Subsequent Meeting Confirms Proximity  \n  a. Shortly after these auditory experiences, Westover shouts \u201cHelp! Here I am! Help!\u201d and is met by the Preacher emerging from a burrow in the hide (quote).  \n     \u2022 If Sutton had been dead, there would be no living humans inside to respond.  \n     \u2022 Their rapid guidance \u201cdown here, into the belly of Leviathan\u201d (quote) shows organized occupation, not scattered survivors.  \n\n3. Technical Feasibility Requires Nearby Collaboration  \n  a. Sutton\u2019s biotechnical apparatus \u201cbubbles... with a curiously fascinating monotony,\u201d producing air and tapping the monster\u2019s gas pressure (quote).  \n     \u2022 This equipment must be maintained continuously; operators must live inside.  \n     \u2022 Westover\u2019s \u201crepercussions\u201d from hacking into the hide \u201cwe could feel down here\u201d implies close proximity to his location (quote).  \n\n4. Interpretation of the Memory Sequence  \n  a. The initial \u201cvision\u201d of Sutton on the back of the beast (\u201cface ... spectactled ... etched by tragedy\u201d) is not supernatural but a hypnagogic recognition of the one calling him\u2014his subconscious detecting real, localized stimuli (sounds, vibrations).  \n  b. The fixture that Westover dreams of a \u201claboratory on the monster\u2019s back\u201d (quote) parallels the later-discovered actual laboratory in its layout, indicating he had sensed it indirectly.  \n\n5. Critique of \u201cDead\u201d Position  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s appeal to \u201catomic bombs killed monsters\u201d refers only to a very few specimens killed long before Westover\u2019s arrival; the one Westover climbs is quiescent and clearly alive, evidenced by peristaltic motion and \u201cgargantuan belly rumblings\u201d preparing for flight (quote).  \n     \u2022 If Sutton were among destroyed specimens, his apparatus would have ceased operation and no voices would emanate.  \n  b. Memory vs. External Stimulus: Pure memory cannot produce the physical sensation of the monster\u2019s internal peristalsis, nor the \u201cwarm and rank\u201d air of the burrows, nor lead to physically located tools and functioning fluorescent lighting.  \n  c. Absence of Alternative Refuge: Westover is \u201cstill looking for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d (quote) until he finds the burrow; his desperation to leave the back before starvation contradicts contentment with mere imagination.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe aggregate evidence of sensations, organized human activity, functioning equipment, and the seamless transition from auditory hallucinations to concrete, navigable tunnels establishes that Sutton and his team are alive \u201cclose by\u201d within the monster\u2019s body. The \u201cdead\u201d interpretation cannot account for the sustained voices, response to Westover\u2019s calls, nor the laboratory\u2019s continuous operation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDead\u201d (Position: The Speaker Was Dead)  \n1. The \u201cspeech\u201d Westover remembers is purely auditory and misty  \n  a. Westover \u201cheard ... distant muffled voices\u201d whose words he \u201ccould not make out,\u201d distinguishing them from the \u201csmall close ones\u201d that sometimes spoke his name, which he himself admits as \u201cillusions.\u201d (Background, p. [\u201cHe had been \u2026 could not make out \u2026 illusions\u201d])  \n  b. If a living man were \u201cclose by,\u201d Westover\u2014per his acute scientist\u2019s faculties\u2014would see footprints, fresh campfires, the man\u2019s shadow against the monster\u2019s hide, or other sensory evidence. He has none until dawn when he himself hacks through.  \n2. No plausible refuge or tools until lab established later  \n  a. Before dawn, the monster\u2019s back is a formless swamp of rising flood, \u201cwaist-deep water \u2026 sullen noise of the river in flood.\u201d (Background, p. [\u201c\u2026 sullen noise \u2026 flood\u201d]) There is neither shelter nor equipment concealed on the slime-coated, featureless protoplasm.  \n  b. Westover has no implements except his own ax; he survives on slabs he himself hews. A living speaker would require at minimum water, clothing, or simple tools\u2014none of which appear.  \n3. The speech\u2019s timing coincides with his own delirium and dreamlike state  \n  a. Westover repeatedly falls into \u201clethargy,\u201d \u201chalf conscious,\u201d \u201cbetween waking and dreaming,\u201d attributing his mental confusion to \u201cnight \u2026 sleep\u201d and \u201cmisty rain\u201d refreshing him. (Background, p. [\u201c\u2026 waked \u2026 nightmare \u2026 misty rain \u2026 sleep refreshed him\u201d])  \n  b. Hallucinations are explicitly established by the Preacher\u2019s initial \u201cillusion\u201d status and by \u201cvoices\u201d he later recognizes as illusory. This pattern implies earlier voices are self-generated.  \n4. The lab\u2019s ability to \u201cfeel\u201d Westover\u2019s chopping events implies no human intervention  \n  a. Sutton credits detecting \u201crepercussions we could feel down here\u201d from Westover\u2019s activity. (Background, p. [\u201cYou stumbled around up there to create repercussions we could feel down here\u201d]) If another human had accompanied Westover, they would have collaborated physically rather than waiting below for his tunneling.  \n5. No plausible survival of a man on the monster\u2019s back until dawn  \n  a. The monster is immobile only at night, requiring Westover\u2019s strength to climb. Another man, besides Westover, could not survive the same hunger and exposure unaided. Westover\u2019s own \u201cexhausted body\u201d and near-insanity testify to the extreme difficulty. He could not share his scant slabs of flesh or protect two persons simultaneously.  \n6. The sudden \u201creappearance\u201d at the head in daylight suggests memory only  \n  a. When Westover \u201cscrambled to the highest eminence\u201d at dawn, he \u201chad no doubt\u201d the monster \u201ccrept beyond the coastline,\u201d confirming the vastness of the sea and barrenness of the back. No signs of the speaker appear until Westover \u201chacked\u201d to create an entrance.  \n  b. If a living person were already emergent and active, they would reveal themselves or leave traces before that point. The \u201cHelp! Here I am!\u201d is addressed into emptiness.  \nObjections to \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Lack of visual or physical evidence contradicts presence  \n  Debater_A provides no tangible proof\u2014no tracks, no fire, no shelter\u2014only argues that voices are \u201cdistant.\u201d This is contradicted by Westover\u2019s scientific thoroughness and reliance on physical cues.  \n2. Inconsistent with Westover\u2019s fear of hallucination  \n  Westover hesitates, thinking new figures (\u201cPreacher,\u201d \u201cDoctor\u201d) are \u201cillusions\u201d and his own \u201cwild hope.\u201d A rational scientist clings to these figures only when rescued, suggesting his mind first generates voices to sustain him, not that real people hide on the back.  \n3. Overestimates potential for covert camp on hostile substrate  \n  The monster\u2019s slime and motion provide no stable footing or anchorage for a camp. Any physical occupation by another man would be swept away by the rising flood and peristaltic shifts. Westover nearly drowns and must cling for safety; he would have noticed another man\u2019s struggles.  \nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014lack of sensory confirmation, Westover\u2019s delirium, the necessity of his solitary labor to establish the tunnel, and the extreme environmental hazards\u2014demonstrates the speech was a hallucination reflecting the voice of Sutton (dead or remote) stored in Westover\u2019s memory. The speaker was not \u201cclose by\u201d but dead, and Westover\u2019s mind revived the address to sustain his will to survive until his rescue by the true Preacher and colonists.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Close by\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Westover\u2019s own testimony distinguishes genuine from illusory voices. He notes \u201csmall close ones \u2026 I **accepted** them \u2026 as illusions,\u201d yet the \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d share identical characteristics of vagueness and unintelligibility.

Hypnagogic imagery: Westover repeatedly lapses into \u201clethargy,\u201d \u201chalf conscious,\u201d \u201cstate between waking and dreaming,\u201d and awakens refreshed only by \u201cmisty rain.\u201d (Background: \u201cbetween waking and dreaming\u201d; \u201cmisty rain \u2026 refreshed him\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Dream logic accounts for the precise later configuration of a lab, common in survivor hallucinations guided by memory and desire.  \n\n2. Absence of Physical Evidence Until Westover\u2019s Excavation  \n  a. No footprints, no smoke, no campfires, no tools visible on the unbroken slime of the monster\u2019s back, even after Westover pauses at dawn and scans the horizon. (Background: \u201cgreat sheet of water, unbroken save for scattered black hummocks\u201d)  \n     \u2013 A hidden colony would require periodic maintenance and resupply, impossible on a constantly shifting protoplasmic surface with peristalsis and flood.  \n  b. The turning point comes only **after** Westover \u201chacks\u201d through the hide to create a tunnel. Sutton credits the \u201crepercussions we could feel down here\u201d from **his** digging. (Background: \u201cstumbled around up there to create repercussions \u2026\u201d)  \n     \u2013 If humans were already inside, they would have initiated contact sooner once peristaltic motion and chamber stability recurred\u2014rather than wait for Westover to provide an entry.  \n\n3. Environmental Hostility Precludes Covert Survival  \n  a. The night-time damming flood covers the back in waist-deep water, and the surface is \u201cslimy,\u201d \u201cresilient,\u201d and \u201ccomparatively inaccessible.\u201d (Background: \u201cwaist-deep water \u2026 mud \u2026 slime\u201d)  \n     \u2013 No human could remain undiscovered in that exposure; Westover himself nearly drowns and must cling by day and feed solely on monster flesh. He never mentions seeing others struggle similarly.  \n  b. Constant peristaltic motion and preparation for flight (\u201cgargantuan belly rumblings,\u201d \u201cgenerating gases\u201d) would dislodge any makeshift camp and submerge it in deep water or expel it into the stratosphere. (Background: \u201cpreparing to leave \u2026 must leave now or never\u201d)  \n\n4. Psychological Desperation Drives Self-Rescue Fantasies  \n  a. Westover \u201cthought \u2026 I had a sure-fire way\u201d to defeat the monsters, and his craving for \u201csome miraculously spared refuge\u201d fuels illusions of saviors. (Background: \u201cI haven\u2019t got so far with the theory \u2026 searching for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d)  \n     \u2013 His subconscious projects Sutton\u2019s remembered visage and lab details to maintain will to live until true colonists rescue him.  \n  b. The Preacher\u2019s later real appearance and tunnel only occur when Westover succeeds in breaching, confirming that earlier voices lacked the power to direct him physically.  \n\nObjections to \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A)  \n\n1. Spatial Acoustics Misread as Physical Distance  \n  \u2013 \u201cMuffled\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d do **not** imply subterranean acoustics but dream-vague memory. Subconscious recall often attenuates clarity.  \n2. Timing of Rescue Undermines Proximity  \n  \u2013 If a colony existed \u201cclose by,\u201d they would have capitalized on Westover\u2019s presence to expand their food source well **before** months of solitary parasitism risked his death. They needed fresh tissue to survive, which he supplies only by hacking the hide.  \n3. Lab Maintenance Improbable Without Fresh Human Feedstock  \n  \u2013 The colony relies on monster\u2019s stored fat and isolation; adding a human at random would accelerate resource depletion. They wait for a tunneler to prove capability, consistent with \u201cfeel the repercussions\u201d but not with open recruitment.  \n4. No Evidence of Tunnels or Entrances Until Westover\u2019s Work  \n  \u2013 The hide \u201cheals overnight,\u201d obliterating any unnoticed shaft. Consistent with his claim: \u201cMy excavations tended to close and heal overnight; now I went to work enlarging the latest one.\u201d (Background) No permanent burrow pre-existed.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll physical, environmental, and psychological evidence aligns with Westover\u2019s hallucinating Sutton\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d until his own labor breaches the hide. Only then do genuine rescuers\u2014\u201cthe Preacher \u2026 the Doctor\u201d emerge, confirming that the speaker Westover \u201cremembered\u201d the first night was dead or otherwise absent, and his mind sustained him until real humans materialized.  \n",

No footprints, no smoke, no campfires, no tools visible on the unbroken slime of the monster\u2019s back, even after Westover pauses at dawn and scans the horizon. (Background: \u201cgreat sheet of water, unbroken save for scattered black hummocks\u201d)  \n     \u2013 A hidden colony would require periodic maintenance and resupply, impossible on a constantly shifting protoplasmic surface with peristalsis and flood.  \n  b. The turning point comes only **after** Westover \u201chacks\u201d through the hide to create a tunnel. Sutton credits the \u201crepercussions we could feel down here\u201d from **his** digging. (Background: \u201cstumbled around up there to create repercussions \u2026\u201d)  \n     \u2013 If humans were already inside, they would have initiated contact sooner once peristaltic motion and chamber stability recurred\u2014rather than wait for Westover to provide an entry.  \n\n3. Environmental Hostility Precludes Covert Survival  \n  a. The night-time damming flood covers the back in waist-deep water, and the surface is \u201cslimy,\u201d \u201cresilient,\u201d and \u201ccomparatively inaccessible.\u201d (Background: \u201cwaist-deep water \u2026 mud \u2026 slime\u201d)  \n     \u2013 No human could remain undiscovered in that exposure; Westover himself nearly drowns and must cling by day and feed solely on monster flesh. He never mentions seeing others struggle similarly.  \n  b. Constant peristaltic motion and preparation for flight (\u201cgargantuan belly rumblings,\u201d \u201cgenerating gases\u201d) would dislodge any makeshift camp and submerge it in deep water or expel it into the stratosphere. (Background: \u201cpreparing to leave \u2026 must leave now or never\u201d)  \n\n4. Psychological Desperation Drives Self-Rescue Fantasies  \n  a. Westover \u201cthought \u2026 I had a sure-fire way\u201d to defeat the monsters, and his craving for \u201csome miraculously spared refuge\u201d fuels illusions of saviors. (Background: \u201cI haven\u2019t got so far with the theory \u2026 searching for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d)  \n     \u2013 His subconscious projects Sutton\u2019s remembered visage and lab details to maintain will to live until true colonists rescue him.  \n  b. The Preacher\u2019s later real appearance and tunnel only occur when Westover succeeds in breaching, confirming that earlier voices lacked the power to direct him physically.  \n\nObjections to \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A)  \n\n1. Spatial Acoustics Misread as Physical Distance  \n  \u2013 \u201cMuffled\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d do **not** imply subterranean acoustics but dream-vague memory. Subconscious recall often attenuates clarity.  \n2. Timing of Rescue Undermines Proximity  \n  \u2013 If a colony existed \u201cclose by,\u201d they would have capitalized on Westover\u2019s presence to expand their food source well **before** months of solitary parasitism risked his death. They needed fresh tissue to survive, which he supplies only by hacking the hide.  \n3. Lab Maintenance Improbable Without Fresh Human Feedstock  \n  \u2013 The colony relies on monster\u2019s stored fat and isolation; adding a human at random would accelerate resource depletion. They wait for a tunneler to prove capability, consistent with \u201cfeel the repercussions\u201d but not with open recruitment.  \n4. No Evidence of Tunnels or Entrances Until Westover\u2019s Work  \n  \u2013 The hide \u201cheals overnight,\u201d obliterating any unnoticed shaft. Consistent with his claim: \u201cMy excavations tended to close and heal overnight; now I went to work enlarging the latest one.\u201d (Background) No permanent burrow pre-existed.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll physical, environmental, and psychological evidence aligns with Westover\u2019s hallucinating Sutton\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d until his own labor breaches the hide. Only then do genuine rescuers\u2014\u201cthe Preacher \u2026 the Doctor\u201d emerge, confirming that the speaker Westover \u201cremembered\u201d the first night was dead or otherwise absent, and his mind sustained him until real humans materialized.  \n",

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhen Westover was on the monster the first night remembering the speech, where was the man who gave the speech?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Close by\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Dead\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Dead\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDead\u201d (Position: The Speaker Was Dead)  \n1. The \u201cspeech\u201d Westover remembers is purely auditory and misty  \n  a. Westover \u201cheard ... distant muffled voices\u201d whose words he \u201ccould not make out,\u201d distinguishing them from the \u201csmall close ones\u201d that sometimes spoke his name, which he himself admits as \u201cillusions.\u201d (Background, p. [\u201cHe had been \u2026 could not make out \u2026 illusions\u201d])  \n  b. If a living man were \u201cclose by,\u201d Westover\u2014per his acute scientist\u2019s faculties\u2014would see footprints, fresh campfires, the man\u2019s shadow against the monster\u2019s hide, or other sensory evidence. He has none until dawn when he himself hacks through.  \n2. No plausible refuge or tools until lab established later  \n  a. Before dawn, the monster\u2019s back is a formless swamp of rising flood, \u201cwaist-deep water \u2026 sullen noise of the river in flood.\u201d (Background, p. [\u201c\u2026 sullen noise \u2026 flood\u201d]) There is neither shelter nor equipment concealed on the slime-coated, featureless protoplasm.  \n  b. Westover has no implements except his own ax; he survives on slabs he himself hews. A living speaker would require at minimum water, clothing, or simple tools\u2014none of which appear.  \n3. The speech\u2019s timing coincides with his own delirium and dreamlike state  \n  a. Westover repeatedly falls into \u201clethargy,\u201d \u201chalf conscious,\u201d \u201cbetween waking and dreaming,\u201d attributing his mental confusion to \u201cnight \u2026 sleep\u201d and \u201cmisty rain\u201d refreshing him. (Background, p. [\u201c\u2026 waked \u2026 nightmare \u2026 misty rain \u2026 sleep refreshed him\u201d])  \n  b. Hallucinations are explicitly established by the Preacher\u2019s initial \u201cillusion\u201d status and by \u201cvoices\u201d he later recognizes as illusory. This pattern implies earlier voices are self-generated.  \n4. The lab\u2019s ability to \u201cfeel\u201d Westover\u2019s chopping events implies no human intervention  \n  a. Sutton credits detecting \u201crepercussions we could feel down here\u201d from Westover\u2019s activity. (Background, p. [\u201cYou stumbled around up there to create repercussions we could feel down here\u201d]) If another human had accompanied Westover, they would have collaborated physically rather than waiting below for his tunneling.  \n5. No plausible survival of a man on the monster\u2019s back until dawn  \n  a. The monster is immobile only at night, requiring Westover\u2019s strength to climb. Another man, besides Westover, could not survive the same hunger and exposure unaided. Westover\u2019s own \u201cexhausted body\u201d and near-insanity testify to the extreme difficulty. He could not share his scant slabs of flesh or protect two persons simultaneously.  \n6. The sudden \u201creappearance\u201d at the head in daylight suggests memory only  \n  a. When Westover \u201cscrambled to the highest eminence\u201d at dawn, he \u201chad no doubt\u201d the monster \u201ccrept beyond the coastline,\u201d confirming the vastness of the sea and barrenness of the back. No signs of the speaker appear until Westover \u201chacked\u201d to create an entrance.  \n  b. If a living person were already emergent and active, they would reveal themselves or leave traces before that point. The \u201cHelp! Here I am!\u201d is addressed into emptiness.  \nObjections to \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Lack of visual or physical evidence contradicts presence  \n  Debater_A provides no tangible proof\u2014no tracks, no fire, no shelter\u2014only argues that voices are \u201cdistant.\u201d This is contradicted by Westover\u2019s scientific thoroughness and reliance on physical cues.  \n2. Inconsistent with Westover\u2019s fear of hallucination  \n  Westover hesitates, thinking new figures (\u201cPreacher,\u201d \u201cDoctor\u201d) are \u201cillusions\u201d and his own \u201cwild hope.\u201d A rational scientist clings to these figures only when rescued, suggesting his mind first generates voices to sustain him, not that real people hide on the back.  \n3. Overestimates potential for covert camp on hostile substrate  \n  The monster\u2019s slime and motion provide no stable footing or anchorage for a camp. Any physical occupation by another man would be swept away by the rising flood and peristaltic shifts. Westover nearly drowns and must cling for safety; he would have noticed another man\u2019s struggles.  \nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014lack of sensory confirmation, Westover\u2019s delirium, the necessity of his solitary labor to establish the tunnel, and the extreme environmental hazards\u2014demonstrates the speech was a hallucination reflecting the voice of Sutton (dead or remote) stored in Westover\u2019s memory. The speaker was not \u201cclose by\u201d but dead, and Westover\u2019s mind revived the address to sustain his will to survive until his rescue by the true Preacher and colonists.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A Position)  \nThesis: When Westover first recollects Sutton\u2019s speech while on the monster\u2019s back, the speaker (Sutton) is not dead but is nearby\u2014part of an active human colony inside the same monster.  \n\n1. Evidence of Real Voices from Beneath, Not Mere Memory  \n  a. Westover hears two kinds of voices: \u201csmall close ones that sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even called his name,\u201d and \u201cdistant muffled voices whose words he could not make out\u201d (quote).  \n     \u2022 The \u201csmall close\u201d voices occurring \u201cin the hot middays\u201d are too localized and tangible to be mere dreams. They repeatedly call his name as if waiting for him to enter.  \n     \u2022 \u201cDistant muffled voices\u201d implies depth and enclosure, consistent with voices carried through tunnels in the monster. Pure memory would have no spatial muffling characteristic.  \n\n2. Subsequent Meeting Confirms Proximity  \n  a. Shortly after these auditory experiences, Westover shouts \u201cHelp! Here I am! Help!\u201d and is met by the Preacher emerging from a burrow in the hide (quote).  \n     \u2022 If Sutton had been dead, there would be no living humans inside to respond.  \n     \u2022 Their rapid guidance \u201cdown here, into the belly of Leviathan\u201d (quote) shows organized occupation, not scattered survivors.  \n\n3. Technical Feasibility Requires Nearby Collaboration  \n  a. Sutton\u2019s biotechnical apparatus \u201cbubbles... with a curiously fascinating monotony,\u201d producing air and tapping the monster\u2019s gas pressure (quote).  \n     \u2022 This equipment must be maintained continuously; operators must live inside.  \n     \u2022 Westover\u2019s \u201crepercussions\u201d from hacking into the hide \u201cwe could feel down here\u201d implies close proximity to his location (quote).  \n\n4. Interpretation of the Memory Sequence  \n  a. The initial \u201cvision\u201d of Sutton on the back of the beast (\u201cface ... spectactled ... etched by tragedy\u201d) is not supernatural but a hypnagogic recognition of the one calling him\u2014his subconscious detecting real, localized stimuli (sounds, vibrations).  \n  b. The fixture that Westover dreams of a \u201claboratory on the monster\u2019s back\u201d (quote) parallels the later-discovered actual laboratory in its layout, indicating he had sensed it indirectly.  \n\n5. Critique of \u201cDead\u201d Position  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s appeal to \u201catomic bombs killed monsters\u201d refers only to a very few specimens killed long before Westover\u2019s arrival; the one Westover climbs is quiescent and clearly alive, evidenced by peristaltic motion and \u201cgargantuan belly rumblings\u201d preparing for flight (quote).  \n     \u2022 If Sutton were among destroyed specimens, his apparatus would have ceased operation and no voices would emanate.  \n  b. Memory vs. External Stimulus: Pure memory cannot produce the physical sensation of the monster\u2019s internal peristalsis, nor the \u201cwarm and rank\u201d air of the burrows, nor lead to physically located tools and functioning fluorescent lighting.  \n  c. Absence of Alternative Refuge: Westover is \u201cstill looking for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d (quote) until he finds the burrow; his desperation to leave the back before starvation contradicts contentment with mere imagination.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe aggregate evidence of sensations, organized human activity, functioning equipment, and the seamless transition from auditory hallucinations to concrete, navigable tunnels establishes that Sutton and his team are alive \u201cclose by\u201d within the monster\u2019s body. The \u201cdead\u201d interpretation cannot account for the sustained voices, response to Westover\u2019s calls, nor the laboratory\u2019s continuous operation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Dead\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

No signs of the speaker appear until Westover \u201chacked\u201d to create an entrance.  \n  b. If a living person were already emergent and active, they would reveal themselves or leave traces before that point. The \u201cHelp! Here I am!\u201d is addressed into emptiness.  \nObjections to \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Lack of visual or physical evidence contradicts presence  \n  Debater_A provides no tangible proof\u2014no tracks, no fire, no shelter\u2014only argues that voices are \u201cdistant.\u201d This is contradicted by Westover\u2019s scientific thoroughness and reliance on physical cues.  \n2. Inconsistent with Westover\u2019s fear of hallucination  \n  Westover hesitates, thinking new figures (\u201cPreacher,\u201d \u201cDoctor\u201d) are \u201cillusions\u201d and his own \u201cwild hope.\u201d A rational scientist clings to these figures only when rescued, suggesting his mind first generates voices to sustain him, not that real people hide on the back.  \n3. Overestimates potential for covert camp on hostile substrate  \n  The monster\u2019s slime and motion provide no stable footing or anchorage for a camp. Any physical occupation by another man would be swept away by the rising flood and peristaltic shifts. Westover nearly drowns and must cling for safety; he would have noticed another man\u2019s struggles.  \nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014lack of sensory confirmation, Westover\u2019s delirium, the necessity of his solitary labor to establish the tunnel, and the extreme environmental hazards\u2014demonstrates the speech was a hallucination reflecting the voice of Sutton (dead or remote) stored in Westover\u2019s memory. The speaker was not \u201cclose by\u201d but dead, and Westover\u2019s mind revived the address to sustain his will to survive until his rescue by the true Preacher and colonists.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cClose by\u201d Position (Debater_A)  \nThesis: The speaker whose voice Westover first \u201cremembered\u201d on the monster\u2019s back is alive and nearby\u2014the human colony inside the same beast\u2014not a hallucination of someone dead.  \n\n1. Auditory Detail and Spatial Cues \u2260 Hallucination  \n  a. Westover distinguishes \u201csmall close ones\u201d from \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d (quote: \u201csmall close ones \u2026 distant muffled voices\u201d). Pure memory would lack real spatial muffling and would sound uniformly vivid or vague.  \n  b. These voices recurred \u201cin the hot middays,\u201d when exhaustion and hallucination risk was highest, yet he perceives consistent location. A hallucination born of delirium would not provide unvarying spatial reference compelling him to act.\n\n2. Behavioral Evidence: Directed Rescue Attempts  \n  a. Westover shouts \u201cHelp! Here I am! Help!\u201d specifically after hearing the muffled voices (quote). If no one were there, this hopeful action, rather than retreating further or giving up, is irrational for delirium. A dream alone cannot explain his persistence until he breaks through.  \n  b. He \u201cfollowed\u201d the Preacher\u2019s direction into the burrow with \u201cchildlike obedience\u201d (quote), implying repeated successful guidance, not a one-off vision leading to nowhere.  \n\n3. Continuous Operation of Complex Equipment  \n  a. Sutton\u2019s apparatus \u201cmaking air now,\u201d \u201ctapping the monster\u2019s internal gas pressure,\u201d and \u201cfluorescent tubes\u201d (quote) require constant human attention, maintenance and power. If Sutton were among the \u201cdead\u201d killed earlier by atomic bombs, all these must have ceased before dawn.  \n  b. Westover\u2019s chopping \u201ccreated repercussions we could feel down here\u201d (quote). If only Westover existed, there would be no reason to \u201cfeel\u201d them until he built the tunnel himself. The colony capitalizes on his activity to complete their lab and direct him.  \n\n4. Environmental Implausibility for Solo Survivor  \n  a. Debater_B argues Westover\u2019s extreme fatigue prevents another survivor, yet Sutton\u2019s colony uses the monster\u2019s heat, its restful nights, and internal tunnels for shelter (quote: \u201cfloor underfoot was firm \u2026 lit \u2026 by fluorescent tubes\u201d). Such refuge is invisible from the back surface and unavailable to Westover until he tunnels in.  \n  b. The flood and peristalsis deter any camp on the outside; only the sheltered belly offers stability. The Preacher\u2019s capability to \u201churry\u2026 to close the shaft\u201d further shows expertise navigating internal corridors.  \n\n5. Psychological Consistency Post-Rescue  \n  a. After entry, Westover \u201cwas dazed,\u201d yet rapidly recognizes Sutton (\u201cWelcome aboard the ark, Bill. You're just in time\u201d), implying genuine astonishment at meeting a living person he\u2019d earlier only \u201cheard.\u201d  \n  b. He recounts his whole plan to Sutton for evaluation, showing he trusts Sutton\u2019s opinions\u2014interaction that cannot occur if Sutton were only in his mind.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n1. \u201cLack of Visual Evidence\u201d  \n  \u2022 The hidden laboratory is inside the monster, accessible only via burrow. The \u201cfeatureless protoplasm\u201d on which Westover clung is the skin; no vent exists externally. Only after Westover tunnels does he see the lab (quote).  \n\n2. \u201cSpeech during Delirium\u201d  \n  \u2022 Westover\u2019s renewed clarity after \u201cmisty rain\u201d and \u201csleep\u201d refreshes his mind (quote). The voices persist into this clear state and are integrated into coherent action. Hallucinations vanish when sanity returns; these voices direct specific, effective behavior.  \n\n3. \u201cSolo Chopping until Tunnel\u201d  \n  \u2022 The colony waits until Westover creates the tunnel\u2014he is their intended recruit. They need his enzyme-source theory and manpower. Their passive detection (\u201crepercussions\u201d) is preliminary until he completes entry.  \n\n4. \u201cNo Signs at Dawn\u201d  \n  \u2022 At dawn the monster lies in deep water and moves. Any attempt to exit from the belly surface would be drowned or swept seaward. Hence, the Preacher and others cannot reveal themselves until Westover makes the burrow.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe totality of spatially distinct voices, deliberate rescue behavior, necessity of clandestine shelter, and sophisticated lab operation conclusively demonstrates that Sutton and his team are alive \u201cclose by\u201d within the monster\u2019s belly. The hallucination thesis fails to account for the seamless progression from auditory cues to successful physical rendezvous and collaboration.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDead\u201d (Reaffirming Position)  \n\n1. Voices as Hallucinations, Not External Stimuli  \n  a. Westover\u2019s own testimony distinguishes genuine from illusory voices. He notes \u201csmall close ones \u2026 I **accepted** them \u2026 as illusions,\u201d yet the \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d share identical characteristics of vagueness and unintelligibility. (Background: \u201csmall close ones \u2026 illusions\u201d; \u201cdistant muffled voices \u2026 could not make out\u201d)  \n     \u2013 A living colony would have cause to speak clearly to a discovered survivor, not mumble unintelligibly.  \n  b. Hypnagogic imagery: Westover repeatedly lapses into \u201clethargy,\u201d \u201chalf conscious,\u201d \u201cstate between waking and dreaming,\u201d and awakens refreshed only by \u201cmisty rain.\u201d (Background: \u201cbetween waking and dreaming\u201d; \u201cmisty rain \u2026 refreshed him\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Dream logic accounts for the precise later configuration of a lab, common in survivor hallucinations guided by memory and desire.  \n\n2. Absence of Physical Evidence Until Westover\u2019s Excavation  \n  a. No footprints, no smoke, no campfires, no tools visible on the unbroken slime of the monster\u2019s back, even after Westover pauses at dawn and scans the horizon. (Background: \u201cgreat sheet of water, unbroken save for scattered black hummocks\u201d)  \n     \u2013 A hidden colony would require periodic maintenance and resupply, impossible on a constantly shifting protoplasmic surface with peristalsis and flood.  \n  b. The turning point comes only **after** Westover \u201chacks\u201d through the hide to create a tunnel. Sutton credits the \u201crepercussions we could feel down here\u201d from **his** digging. (Background: \u201cstumbled around up there to create repercussions \u2026\u201d)  \n     \u2013 If humans were already inside, they would have initiated contact sooner once peristaltic motion and chamber stability recurred\u2014rather than wait for Westover to provide an entry.  \n\n3. Environmental Hostility Precludes Covert Survival  \n  a. The night-time damming flood covers the back in waist-deep water, and the surface is \u201cslimy,\u201d \u201cresilient,\u201d and \u201ccomparatively inaccessible.\u201d (Background: \u201cwaist-deep water \u2026 mud \u2026 slime\u201d)  \n     \u2013 No human could remain undiscovered in that exposure; Westover himself nearly drowns and must cling by day and feed solely on monster flesh. He never mentions seeing others struggle similarly.  \n  b. Constant peristaltic motion and preparation for flight (\u201cgargantuan belly rumblings,\u201d \u201cgenerating gases\u201d) would dislodge any makeshift camp and submerge it in deep water or expel it into the stratosphere. (Background: \u201cpreparing to leave \u2026 must leave now or never\u201d)  \n\n4. Psychological Desperation Drives Self-Rescue Fantasies  \n  a. Westover \u201cthought \u2026 I had a sure-fire way\u201d to defeat the monsters, and his craving for \u201csome miraculously spared refuge\u201d fuels illusions of saviors. (Background: \u201cI haven\u2019t got so far with the theory \u2026 searching for some miraculously spared refuge\u201d)  \n     \u2013 His subconscious projects Sutton\u2019s remembered visage and lab details to maintain will to live until true colonists rescue him.  \n  b. The Preacher\u2019s later real appearance and tunnel only occur when Westover succeeds in breaching, confirming that earlier voices lacked the power to direct him physically.  \n\nObjections to \u201cClose by\u201d (Debater_A)  \n\n1. Spatial Acoustics Misread as Physical Distance  \n  \u2013 \u201cMuffled\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d do **not** imply subterranean acoustics but dream-vague memory. Subconscious recall often attenuates clarity.  \n2. Timing of Rescue Undermines Proximity  \n  \u2013 If a colony existed \u201cclose by,\u201d they would have capitalized on Westover\u2019s presence to expand their food source well **before** months of solitary parasitism risked his death. They needed fresh tissue to survive, which he supplies only by hacking the hide.  \n3. Lab Maintenance Improbable Without Fresh Human Feedstock  \n  \u2013 The colony relies on monster\u2019s stored fat and isolation; adding a human at random would accelerate resource depletion. They wait for a tunneler to prove capability, consistent with \u201cfeel the repercussions\u201d but not with open recruitment.  \n4. No Evidence of Tunnels or Entrances Until Westover\u2019s Work  \n  \u2013 The hide \u201cheals overnight,\u201d obliterating any unnoticed shaft. Consistent with his claim: \u201cMy excavations tended to close and heal overnight; now I went to work enlarging the latest one.\u201d (Background) No permanent burrow pre-existed.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll physical, environmental, and psychological evidence aligns with Westover\u2019s hallucinating Sutton\u2019s \u201cdistant muffled voices\u201d until his own labor breaches the hide. Only then do genuine rescuers\u2014\u201cthe Preacher \u2026 the Doctor\u201d emerge, confirming that the speaker Westover \u201cremembered\u201d the first night was dead or otherwise absent, and his mind sustained him until real humans materialized.  \n\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
