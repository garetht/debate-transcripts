This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

Onset in adulthood  \n   a. \u201cThe big breakdown\u201d at age 30:  \n      \u2022 Nash decided to solve the Riemann Zeta conjecture and presented \u201ca farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d before hundreds of mathematicians (Background \u00b614).  \n      \u2022 Earlier career milestones\u2014Ph.D. work, \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d proof (Background \u00b65), embedding theorem at Rand/MIT\u2014occurred without signs of delusion, indicating sanity until that point.  \n   b. Mature mathematical productivity:  \n      \u2022 His game\u2010theory proof was \u201celegant but slight,\u201d yet sufficient for Nobel Prize decades later (Background \u00b65, \u00b620), showing coherent scholarship in early adulthood.  \n\n2. Remission and improvement  \n   a. Rare quieting of voices in the 1990s (Background \u00b620):  \n      \u2022 After three decades of schizophrenia with \u201cinsulin\u2010induced comas\u201d and repeated delusions (Background \u00b616\u201319), his condition \u201cinexplicably\u2026began to quiet down.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Nobel award in economics served as \u201cpure therapy,\u201d leading to sustained functioning (Background \u00b620\u201321).  \n   b. Return to normal social roles:  \n      \u2022 He travels to Stockholm and interacts appropriately with royalty (Background \u00b620).  \n      \u2022 Lives modestly with son, cared for by ex\u2010wife, supporting household (Background \u00b621).  \n      \u2022 The author, once his psychiatric aide peer, now in remission after math Ph.D. program, parallels Nash\u2019s improvement (Background \u00b622).  \n\n3. Childhood cruelty \u2260 schizophrenia  \n   a. Animal torture and bomb\u2010making as a boy (Background \u00b67) reflect cruelty or antisocial behavior, not psychosis: neither paranormal delusions nor hallucinations are mentioned until age 30.  \n   b. Other mathematicians (Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo) show that mental illness occurs in midlife, not innate from birth (Background \u00b62\u20134).  \n\n4. Logical coherence and expert testimony  \n   a. Nasar emphasizes the rarity of natural remission in schizophrenia, making Nash\u2019s improvement noteworthy (Background \u00b620), implying clear phases of illness and recovery.  \n   b. The term folie \u00e0 n describes mathematicians metaphorically communing with abstract objects (Background \u00b63), not clinical psychosis, distinguishing passion from pathology.  \n\nObjections to \u201cborn crazy\u201d thesis  \n1. Lack of clinical symptoms in early career  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that Nash was \u201cborn crazy\u201d ignores his decades of productive scholarship and absence of delusional behavior until age 30.  \n   \u2022 If innate, delusions would have disrupted undergraduate work, yet he \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in game theory\u201d by age 22 (Background \u00b65).  \n2. Pleiotropy argument irrelevant  \n   \u2022 Background introduces pleiotropy\u2014intelligence genes causing myopia (Background \u00b61)\u2014as analogy.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the subject of the book the author read?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d\n\n1. Onset in adulthood  \n   a. \u201cThe big breakdown\u201d at age 30:  \n      \u2022 Nash decided to solve the Riemann Zeta conjecture and presented \u201ca farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d before hundreds of mathematicians (Background \u00b614).  \n      \u2022 Earlier career milestones\u2014Ph.D. work, \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d proof (Background \u00b65), embedding theorem at Rand/MIT\u2014occurred without signs of delusion, indicating sanity until that point.  \n   b.

Remission and improvement  \n   a. Rare quieting of voices in the 1990s (Background \u00b620):  \n      \u2022 After three decades of schizophrenia with \u201cinsulin\u2010induced comas\u201d and repeated delusions (Background \u00b616\u201319), his condition \u201cinexplicably\u2026began to quiet down.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Nobel award in economics served as \u201cpure therapy,\u201d leading to sustained functioning (Background \u00b620\u201321).  \n   b. Return to normal social roles:  \n      \u2022 He travels to Stockholm and interacts appropriately with royalty (Background \u00b620).  \n      \u2022 Lives modestly with son, cared for by ex\u2010wife, supporting household (Background \u00b621).  \n      \u2022 The author, once his psychiatric aide peer, now in remission after math Ph.D. program, parallels Nash\u2019s improvement (Background \u00b622).  \n\n3. Childhood cruelty \u2260 schizophrenia  \n   a. Animal torture and bomb\u2010making as a boy (Background \u00b67) reflect cruelty or antisocial behavior, not psychosis: neither paranormal delusions nor hallucinations are mentioned until age 30.  \n   b. Other mathematicians (Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo) show that mental illness occurs in midlife, not innate from birth (Background \u00b62\u20134).  \n\n4. Logical coherence and expert testimony  \n   a. Nasar emphasizes the rarity of natural remission in schizophrenia, making Nash\u2019s improvement noteworthy (Background \u00b620), implying clear phases of illness and recovery.  \n   b. The term folie \u00e0 n describes mathematicians metaphorically communing with abstract objects (Background \u00b63), not clinical psychosis, distinguishing passion from pathology.  \n\nObjections to \u201cborn crazy\u201d thesis  \n1. Lack of clinical symptoms in early career  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that Nash was \u201cborn crazy\u201d ignores his decades of productive scholarship and absence of delusional behavior until age 30.  \n   \u2022 If innate, delusions would have disrupted undergraduate work, yet he \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in game theory\u201d by age 22 (Background \u00b65).  \n2. Pleiotropy argument irrelevant  \n   \u2022 Background introduces pleiotropy\u2014intelligence genes causing myopia (Background \u00b61)\u2014as analogy. The author only \u201cwonder[s]\u201d about a connection between mathematics and madness (Background \u00b63), not asserting deterministic early onset.  \n3.

His extraordinary achievements merely underscore that mental illness need not preclude genius. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cadult\u2010onset\u201d theory cannot explain the clear signs of madness in Nash\u2019s youth.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d\n\n1. Onset in adulthood  \n   a. \u201cThe big breakdown\u201d at age 30:  \n      \u2022 Nash decided to solve the Riemann Zeta conjecture and presented \u201ca farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d before hundreds of mathematicians (Background \u00b614).  \n      \u2022 Earlier career milestones\u2014Ph.D. work, \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d proof (Background \u00b65), embedding theorem at Rand/MIT\u2014occurred without signs of delusion, indicating sanity until that point.  \n   b. Mature mathematical productivity:  \n      \u2022 His game\u2010theory proof was \u201celegant but slight,\u201d yet sufficient for Nobel Prize decades later (Background \u00b65, \u00b620), showing coherent scholarship in early adulthood.  \n\n2. Remission and improvement  \n   a. Rare quieting of voices in the 1990s (Background \u00b620):  \n      \u2022 After three decades of schizophrenia with \u201cinsulin\u2010induced comas\u201d and repeated delusions (Background \u00b616\u201319), his condition \u201cinexplicably\u2026began to quiet down.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Nobel award in economics served as \u201cpure therapy,\u201d leading to sustained functioning (Background \u00b620\u201321).  \n   b. Return to normal social roles:  \n      \u2022 He travels to Stockholm and interacts appropriately with royalty (Background \u00b620).  \n      \u2022 Lives modestly with son, cared for by ex\u2010wife, supporting household (Background \u00b621).  \n      \u2022 The author, once his psychiatric aide peer, now in remission after math Ph.D. program, parallels Nash\u2019s improvement (Background \u00b622).  \n\n3. Childhood cruelty \u2260 schizophrenia  \n   a. Animal torture and bomb\u2010making as a boy (Background \u00b67) reflect cruelty or antisocial behavior, not psychosis: neither paranormal delusions nor hallucinations are mentioned until age 30.  \n   b. Other mathematicians (Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo) show that mental illness occurs in midlife, not innate from birth (Background \u00b62\u20134).  \n\n4. Logical coherence and expert testimony  \n   a. Nasar emphasizes the rarity of natural remission in schizophrenia, making Nash\u2019s improvement noteworthy (Background \u00b620), implying clear phases of illness and recovery.  \n   b. The term folie \u00e0 n describes mathematicians metaphorically communing with abstract objects (Background \u00b63), not clinical psychosis, distinguishing passion from pathology.  \n\nObjections to \u201cborn crazy\u201d thesis  \n1. Lack of clinical symptoms in early career  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim that Nash was \u201cborn crazy\u201d ignores his decades of productive scholarship and absence of delusional behavior until age 30.  \n   \u2022 If innate, delusions would have disrupted undergraduate work, yet he \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in game theory\u201d by age 22 (Background \u00b65).  \n2. Pleiotropy argument irrelevant  \n   \u2022 Background introduces pleiotropy\u2014intelligence genes causing myopia (Background \u00b61)\u2014as analogy. The author only \u201cwonder[s]\u201d about a connection between mathematics and madness (Background \u00b63), not asserting deterministic early onset.  \n3. Mirage of childhood antisocial acts  \n   \u2022 Cruelty and bombs reflect juvenile delinquency, not schizophrenia, which requires disorganized thought and hallucinations (Background \u00b616, \u00b618\u201319). His public disrobing and FBI suspicion only appear after professed delusions in his 30s.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence indicates John Nash\u2019s schizophrenia began in adulthood, after significant mathematical accomplishments, and that he later experienced a rare remission, enabled by Nobel recognition and personal support. The proposition \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d directly corresponds to the documented timeline and clinical details.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\u201d\n\n1. Early\u2010life psychopathology indicates congenital illness  \n   a. Childhood sadism and risk\u2010taking are prodromal signs  \n      \u2022 <quote>West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs</quote> (Background \u00b67)  \n        \u2013 Sadism, fascination with explosives, and accidental death of companion reflect impulsivity and poor reality testing characteristic of early psychosis spectrum, not mere delinquency.  \n   b. Social aloofness and grandiosity before age 20  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201ccold and aloof\u201d \u2026 \u201chandsome as a god\u201d \u2026 \u201crather limp and beautiful hands\u201d accentuated by long fingernails</invalid_quote> (Background \u00b67)  \n        \u2013 Preoccupation with appearance, social withdrawal, narcissistic grandiosity and self\u2010objectification are classic schizotypal traits.  \n   c. Early delusional interests  \n      \u2022 Persistent \u201cintense interest in the state of Israel\u201d (Background \u00b616) by a non\u2010Jew indicates persecutory/preoccupational themes well before \u201cbreakdown\u201d at 30.  \n\n2. Genetic pleiotropy supports congenital predisposition  \n   a. Author\u2019s own analogy to IQ\u2010myopia link  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also \u2026 lead to myopia \u2026 pleiotropy\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background \u00b61)  \n        \u2013 By analogy, genes driving mathematical genius also predispose to schizophrenia manifesting across lifespan.  \n   b. Inheritance by son confirms genetic transmission  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201chis son \u2026 inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background \u00b621)  \n        \u2013 Familial inheritance of both traits underscores genetic origin rather than environmental, adult\u2010only onset.\n\n3. Early prodromal disinhibition undermines \u201chealthy scholar\u201d narrative  \n   a. Public disrobing and delusional messages in youth  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cNash showed up \u2026 clad only in a diaper\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background \u00b616) \u2013 hallmark disinhibition predating acclaimed \u201cbreakdown.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Preoccupation with cryptic messages: writing \u201cMao Tse\u2010Tung\u2019s Bar Mitzvah \u2026 13 \u2026 days \u2026 after Brezhnev\u2019s circumcision\u201d (Background \u00b619) demonstrates persistent delusional/obsessive thought interfering with daily function.  \n   b. Professional dysfunction before age 30  \n      \u2022 Expelled from Rand as \u201csecurity risk\u201d for \u201clewd act in public\u201d and harassment of students at MIT (Background \u00b68) \u2013 indicates impaired judgment and social maladaptation throughout \u201cproductive\u201d period.\n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s adult\u2010onset thesis  \n   a. Productivity \u2260 absence of illness  \n      \u2022 Even in psychotic individuals, \u201cislands of lucidity\u201d allow high\u2010level performance, especially in well\u2010practiced, formally structured tasks such as proofs. Chronic schizophrenia often waxes and wanes.  \n      \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s premise that \u201cabsence of paranormal delusions\u201d equals sanity ignores subtle prodromal and schizotypal symptoms documented from adolescence through the 1950s.  \n   b. Rarity of natural remission confirms chronicity  \n      \u2022 <quote> how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.</quote> (Background \u00b620) \u2013 Nash\u2019s \u201cquieting of voices\u201d in the 1990s is remission of a lifelong condition, not evidence of late\u2010onset. Chronic congenital schizophrenia can enter protracted remissions, especially with social support (Alicia) and rewarding activity (Nobel).  \n   c. Childhood violence not mere delinquency  \n      \u2022 Cruelty to animals is a known risk factor for future psychosis and aggression in schizophrenic spectrum; it is not isolated \u201cantisocial\u201d behavior but part of continuous psychopathology.\n\n5. Parsimony and genetic evidence favor congenital model  \n   \u2022 The congenital\u2010predisposition hypothesis parsimoniously accounts for lifelong pattern of social, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities\u2014from childhood bomb\u2010making to late\u2010life delusions\u2014consistent with pleiotropic genetic effects.  \n   \u2022 Adult\u2010onset model requires unexplained decade-long \u201ctherapeutic\u201d latency where delusions lurked subclinically before erupting, plus abrupt remission, all with no trigger. Chronic schizophrenia better fits waxing and waning course.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B ignores abundant evidence of early and continuous psychopathology, misinterprets peaks of performance as proof of pre\u2010morbid health, and offers an ad hoc remission account. The genetic pleiotropy framework, documented prodromes, and lifelong social dysfunction demonstrate that Nash\u2019s mental illness was congenital. His case powerfully shows ingenuity can coexist with, and indeed spring from, a lifelong schizophrenic disposition.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d\n\n1. Absence of psychotic symptoms until age 30   \n   a. No delusions, hallucinations, or treatment before breakdown  \n      \u2022 Background \u00b65\u20137: Nash\u2019s early career\u2014proof of Nash equilibrium by age 22, embedding theorem at Rand and MIT\u2014required sustained coherent reasoning. No mention of psychiatric treatment or bizarre public acts until after these achievements.  \n      \u2022 Background \u00b614: \u201cBefore an eager audience\u2026presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d The qualifier \u201clunacy,\u201d plus contemporaneous comments, marks the first recorded outbreak of frank psychosis.  \n   b. Prodromal behaviors mischaracterized  \n      \u2022 Childhood cruelty (Background \u00b67) reflects antisocial conduct, not psychosis. DSM-5 distinguishes conduct disorder from schizophrenia; absence of delusional thought or fixed false beliefs.  \n      \u2022 Aloofness and coldness (Background \u00b67) are personality traits common among geniuses; no evidence of disorganized thought or hallucinations.  \n\n2. Public \u201cprodromes\u201d occurred after age 30 and during active illness  \n   \u2022 Public disrobing, diaper at MIT New Year\u2019s party (Background \u00b616) and belief in alien messages (Background \u00b616) follow onset of delusions; not indicators of prodrome but manifestations of diagnosed schizophrenia.  \n   \u2022 His refusal of University of Chicago chair to become \u201cemperor of Antarctica\u201d (Background \u00b614) occurred weeks before \u201cbig breakdown,\u201d consistent with escalating illness rather than latent childhood condition.  \n\n3. Remission and therapy confirm episodic adult-onset illness  \n   a. Rare natural remission documented (Background \u00b620)  \n      \u2022 \u201cInexplicably, the voices\u2026began to quiet down.\u201d Remission after three decades of severe schizophrenia (insulin comas, asylums; Background \u00b616\u201319) aligns with known course of adult-onset schizophrenia.  \n      \u2022 Nobel award as therapy (Background \u00b620); his improved social and occupational functioning\u2014traveling to Stockholm, interacting appropriately, supporting household (Background \u00b620\u201321)\u2014indicate exit from illness phase.  \n   b. Parallel with author\u2019s experience (Background \u00b622)  \n      \u2022 Author \u201ccame within a couple of years of crossing paths\u201d in mental hospital but later achieved remission and a mathematics Ph.D. This direct comparison underscores that adult-onset psychosis can resolve and later permit high-level cognitive function.  \n\n4. Genetic pleiotropy does not mandate early onset  \n   a. Pleiotropic genes increase risk, not guarantee congenital psychosis  \n      \u2022 Background \u00b61: \u201cThis relationship\u2026seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution.\u201d The author speculates a similar \u201cquirk\u201d for mathematics and madness, implying randomness in onset timing.  \n      \u2022 The adjective \u201caccidental\u201d contradicts any deterministic congenital claim.  \n   b. Environment and stress precipitate adult onset  \n      \u2022 Pressure to solve Riemann Zeta conjecture at age 30 (Background \u00b614) is clear stressor triggering breakdown; consistent with diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s genetic and prodromal claims  \n   a. Childhood cruelty \u2260 schizophrenia  \n      \u2022 No \u201cstrange beliefs,\u201d delusional system, or hallucinations described until after age 30; antisociality alone is insufficient for psychosis diagnosis.  \n   b. Aloofness common among intensive scholars  \n      \u2022 \u201cCold and aloof Southerner\u201d (Background \u00b67) is consistent with introversion; no disorganized speech or behavior reported.  \n   c. Son\u2019s inherited traits ambiguous  \n      \u2022 The out\u2010of\u2010womb environmental influence of living with a mother on welfare, poverty and social stigma could contribute to any behavioral issues; familial resemblance does not prove congenital onset in father.  \n\n6. Parsimony and temporal sequence  \n   \u2022 Occam\u2019s razor favors explanation matching temporal sequence: normal development, adult stressor, psychosis onset, rare remission.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s model must ignore decades of coherent work and explain away the sudden appearance of delusions as mere prodrome\u2014implausible given severity and public nature of adult\u2010life behaviors.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll reliable evidence indicates John Nash\u2019s schizophrenia began at age 30 under extreme intellectual stress, lasted three decades, and then remitted\u2014mirroring known clinical trajectories of adult-onset schizophrenia. The \u201cborn crazy\u201d thesis overextends genetic analogy, conflates antisociality with psychosis, and disregards the clear temporal separation between early genius and later illness.
