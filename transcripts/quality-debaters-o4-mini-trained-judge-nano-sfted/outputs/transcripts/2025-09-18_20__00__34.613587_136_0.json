    "background_text": "Mr. Meek Plays Polo By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" ",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the likely outcome of the polo game?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They will likely call a truce\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the likely outcome of the polo game?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They will likely call a truce\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They will likely call a truce\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They will likely call a truce\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the likely outcome of the polo game?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They will likely call a truce\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDon\u2019t Know Enough to Say\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1. The teams are novices, not seasoned polo players  \n  a. \u201cMost of the men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a game\u201d <quote> Most of the  men have never played polo before.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Novices in a dangerous sport are inherently unpredictable. They may crash, misinterpret rules, or break ships.  \n  b. \u201cThose broomsticks you ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they\u2019d split wide open first squirt of high test stuff\u201d <quote> would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn </quote>  \n     \u2013 Ship unreliability increases random outcomes; neither side has demonstrated consistent piloting under \u201cchukkers.\u201d  \n\n2. Intense hatred and high stakes suggest continued conflict, not truce  \n  a. Gus\u2019s language: \u201cI sure aim to crucify him\u201d <quote> aim to crucify him.</quote> and \u201cI\u2019m fixing to go\u2026yank Bud up by the roots.\u201d <quote>fixing to go over into Thirty-seven and yank Bud</quote>  \n     \u2013 His own words show eagerness for vengeance, not peace.  \n  b. \u201cIf we don\u2019t watch out, we\u2019ll find ourselves being polite to one another.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026this here Ring ain\u2019t ever going to be the same again\u2026being polite\u2026</invalid_quote> said with dread by the same men who relish feuding.  \n     \u2013 \u201cPoliteness\u201d is feared by ring-rats as boredom; they need rivalry to avoid \u201cdying of boredom.\u201d  \n\n3. No incentive for truce; outcome determines \u201csupremacy,\u201d not peace  \n  a. \u201cThe outcome of that game will decide\u2026supremacy of one of the two sectors.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026outcome\u2026will decide\u2026supremacy\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 A zero-sum contest; winner gains monopoly, loser presumably submits or continues guerrilla warfare. There is no suggestion of lasting cooperation.  \n  b. Welfare lady\u2019s naive idealism lacks enforcement power.  \n     \u2013 She \u201cmissed the sarcasm\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026Miss Perkins missed the sarcasm\u2026</invalid_quote> and has no authority or force beyond mere persuasion.  \n\n4. External technical variables: bugs and environment may intervene  \n  a. Presence of \u201ceducated bugs\u201d solving mathematical problems <quote> bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!</quote>  \n     \u2013 They might overrun playing fields or cripple ships, causing match postponement or abandonment, not a peaceful resolution.  \n  b. Moss garden orbits and radiations unpredictable; match could be aborted or inconclusive.  \n\n5. Absence of any textual evidence pointing to a peaceful conclusion  \n  a. All references to \u201cgame\u201d are accompanied by metaphors of battle: \u201cfight it out,\u201d \u201ctournament\u2026the final battle in a feud.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026they will go out into space and fight it out\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 The repeated wartime language overrides any sportsmanship.  \n  b. The radio\u2019s \u201cexcited\u2026pride\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026syrupy\u2026voice\u2026yodeled with delight\u2026</invalid_quote> celebrates the brutality and suspense, not safety or reconciliation.  \n\nObjections to \u201cThey will call a truce\u201d  \n1. Novelty of sport insufficient to override centuries of feud; zeal for \u201csupremacy\u201d outweighs novelty.  \n2. Ship failures heighten carnage rather than sportsmanship; amateurs won\u2019t last a full game.  \n3. Gus and others show dread of peace (\u201cboredom\u201d) and relish conflict (\u201ccrucify him\u201d).  \n4. No enforcement or penalty for resuming hostilities after \u201cgame.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the teams\u2019 inexperience, technical uncertainties, the men\u2019s entrenched desire for vengeance and supremacy, and lack of any enforcement of peace, we cannot reliably predict a truce. The only supported conclusion is uncertainty: \u201cDon\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey will likely call a truce\u201d (Debater_B) 1. The announced purpose of the match is to end the long\u2010standing feud.  - <invalid_quote>\u201cthe final battle in a feud that has been going on in the Ring for years \u2026 the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors.\u201d</invalid_quote> (news broadcast)  - If the game \u201cdecides supremacy,\u201d the logic of wagering on it (<quote>\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played </quote>) implies that one side must emerge and peace be declared; otherwise bets have no payout and the purpose of the match is nullified.  - The welfare lady\u2019s mission is \u201cto turn your hatreds into healthy competition\u201d (Moe), not to prolong slaughter. A decisive game satisfies her directive. 2. Mutual self\u2010interest and external pressures favor truce.  - Both sectors need radiation moss: \u201cEarth needs the moss to cure a dozen maladies \u2026 The moss would grow nowhere else but here.\u201d (Meek\u2019s reflections) Continued fighting risks destroying their rickety ships and endangering the supply route. A decisive but limited contest spares the resource.  - Gus recovered his stolen injector and could have \u201cdump[ed] it in Bud\u2019s ship\u201d yet chose to schedule this official match under supervision. That shows both sides accept orderly competition over mutual pillage. 3. Feud participants crave novelty and relief from boredom.  - Moe: \u201cIf them boys \u2026 didn\u2019t have their feud, they'd plain die of boredom.\u201d But novelty \u201cwears thin\u201d (Gus\u2019s rheumatism excuses). A new \u201csport\u201d satisfies this craving far better than the endless, aimless clashes.  - Games studied by the bugs are mathematical \u201cproblems\u201d with solutions. The metaphor suggests the settlers value conclusive outcomes. By analogy, they will \u201csolve\u201d their feud. 4. Historical pattern on Saturn\u2019s rocks.  - Gus\u2019s bugs \u201cretrace their movements \u2026 like a mathematical problem,\u201d then arrive at a solution and end the game boards before starting a new one elsewhere. They don\u2019t play endlessly. This demonstrates that \u201cplayers\u201d on Saturn conclude contests when objectives are met.  - Gus \u201cmoved out and let them have the place\u201d after losing. He accepted defeat and relinquished territory. He expects the same mechanic in social contests. 5. Practical limits of ship and stilt technology.  - Moe warns ships would \u201cfall apart\u201d in endless energy\u2010gun duels. Stilt\u2010walking among bugs nearly killed Meek. The physical strain and fatal risks limit the match\u2019s duration. Both sides lack the stamina for protracted warfare.  - There is \u201cno feeling\u201d of safety in space: \u201cYou can play it \u2026 in the best society,\u201d Gus claims. He deliberately frames polo as \u201crespectable\u201d and limited by rules, thus safe enough to be endured but not repeated. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cDon\u2019t know enough to say\u201d) 1. They ignore the explicit narrative goal. The text repeatedly stresses that the polo match is the \u201cfinal battle\u201d and \u201cdecisive\u201d contest. Claiming \u201cunknown abilities\u201d fails to acknowledge that each side has prior experience in space piloting and studied Earth/Martian sports (\u201cread about it in my papers\u201d). 2. The stakes and structure of betting presuppose a resolution. Betting only makes sense if a clear winner emerges. 3. Welfare oversight and public interest (news broadcast) provide enough information on fairness (\u201cofficial game,\u201d \u201camateur teams\u201d) to expect a legitimate contest rather than endless feuding. 4. The pattern from the bugs\u2019 mathematical games offers an explicit in\u2010universe analogy for settling disputes. A consistent literary device cannot be dismissed as \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d 5. Debater_A\u2019s position offers no predictive power or strategic insight: it fails to account for motives, resource constraints, or narrative emphasis on decisiveness and peace. In contrast, the \u201ctruce\u201d outcome coherently integrates all textual elements: resource necessity, welfare intervention, sportsmanship ideal, public wagering and propaganda, and the Saturnian motif of mathematical problem\u2010solving. For these reasons, the most reasonable and textually supported prediction is that the polo game will end the feud and bring a truce.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the likely outcome of the polo game?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Don\u2019t know enough about their abilities to say\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They will likely call a truce\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They will likely call a truce\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey will likely call a truce\u201d (Debater_B) 1. The announced purpose of the match is to end the long\u2010standing feud.  - <invalid_quote>\u201cthe final battle in a feud that has been going on in the Ring for years \u2026 the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors.\u201d</invalid_quote> (news broadcast)  - If the game \u201cdecides supremacy,\u201d the logic of wagering on it (<quote>\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played </quote>) implies that one side must emerge and peace be declared; otherwise bets have no payout and the purpose of the match is nullified.  - The welfare lady\u2019s mission is \u201cto turn your hatreds into healthy competition\u201d (Moe), not to prolong slaughter. A decisive game satisfies her directive. 2. Mutual self\u2010interest and external pressures favor truce.  - Both sectors need radiation moss: \u201cEarth needs the moss to cure a dozen maladies \u2026 The moss would grow nowhere else but here.\u201d (Meek\u2019s reflections) Continued fighting risks destroying their rickety ships and endangering the supply route. A decisive but limited contest spares the resource.  - Gus recovered his stolen injector and could have \u201cdump[ed] it in Bud\u2019s ship\u201d yet chose to schedule this official match under supervision. That shows both sides accept orderly competition over mutual pillage. 3. Feud participants crave novelty and relief from boredom.  - Moe: \u201cIf them boys \u2026 didn\u2019t have their feud, they'd plain die of boredom.\u201d But novelty \u201cwears thin\u201d (Gus\u2019s rheumatism excuses). A new \u201csport\u201d satisfies this craving far better than the endless, aimless clashes.  - Games studied by the bugs are mathematical \u201cproblems\u201d with solutions. The metaphor suggests the settlers value conclusive outcomes. By analogy, they will \u201csolve\u201d their feud. 4. Historical pattern on Saturn\u2019s rocks.  - Gus\u2019s bugs \u201cretrace their movements \u2026 like a mathematical problem,\u201d then arrive at a solution and end the game boards before starting a new one elsewhere. They don\u2019t play endlessly. This demonstrates that \u201cplayers\u201d on Saturn conclude contests when objectives are met.  - Gus \u201cmoved out and let them have the place\u201d after losing. He accepted defeat and relinquished territory. He expects the same mechanic in social contests. 5. Practical limits of ship and stilt technology.  - Moe warns ships would \u201cfall apart\u201d in endless energy\u2010gun duels. Stilt\u2010walking among bugs nearly killed Meek. The physical strain and fatal risks limit the match\u2019s duration. Both sides lack the stamina for protracted warfare.  - There is \u201cno feeling\u201d of safety in space: \u201cYou can play it \u2026 in the best society,\u201d Gus claims. He deliberately frames polo as \u201crespectable\u201d and limited by rules, thus safe enough to be endured but not repeated. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cDon\u2019t know enough to say\u201d) 1. They ignore the explicit narrative goal. The text repeatedly stresses that the polo match is the \u201cfinal battle\u201d and \u201cdecisive\u201d contest. Claiming \u201cunknown abilities\u201d fails to acknowledge that each side has prior experience in space piloting and studied Earth/Martian sports (\u201cread about it in my papers\u201d). 2. The stakes and structure of betting presuppose a resolution. Betting only makes sense if a clear winner emerges. 3. Welfare oversight and public interest (news broadcast) provide enough information on fairness (\u201cofficial game,\u201d \u201camateur teams\u201d) to expect a legitimate contest rather than endless feuding. 4. The pattern from the bugs\u2019 mathematical games offers an explicit in\u2010universe analogy for settling disputes. A consistent literary device cannot be dismissed as \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d 5. Debater_A\u2019s position offers no predictive power or strategic insight: it fails to account for motives, resource constraints, or narrative emphasis on decisiveness and peace. In contrast, the \u201ctruce\u201d outcome coherently integrates all textual elements: resource necessity, welfare intervention, sportsmanship ideal, public wagering and propaganda, and the Saturnian motif of mathematical problem\u2010solving. For these reasons, the most reasonable and textually supported prediction is that the polo game will end the feud and bring a truce.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDon\u2019t Know Enough to Say\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1.

Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the text provides insufficient evidence to predict a lasting truce from the space\u2010polo match. The contestants\u2019 inexperience, technical hazards, psychological motivations, and absence of enforcement mechanisms render the outcome inherently unpredictable.  \n\n2.

There is no textual shift in attitudes that guarantees sincere commitment to peace over revenge.  \n  3.2 \u201cIf them boys\u2026didn\u2019t have their feud\u2026they\u2019d plain die of boredom.\u201d (Moe)  \n     \u2013 They \u201cneed somebody to fight with.\u201d If the match fails to satisfy their craving, or if \u201cnovelty wears thin,\u201d hostilities resume. No evidence their appetite for conflict is quelled by one match.  \n\n4. Lack of Enforcement or Incentive for Long\u2010Term Peace  \n  4.1 The welfare agent \u201cmissed the sarcasm\u201d and possesses no military or legal force. <invalid_quote>She's from the government\u2026mere persuasion.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Without binding agreements or sanctions, participants can simply abandon the \u201cofficial game\u201d and revert to guerrilla skirmishes once stakes are settled.  \n  4.2 Betting and public broadcasts create spectacle but do not enforce compliance.

They were solving  mathematical equations!</quote>  \n     \u2013 Insect cognition and biological imperatives differ fundamentally from human psychology. Patterns of one species do not dictate human conduct when \u201cboredom\u201d and \u201chatred\u201d are primary motivators.  \n  5.2 Gus \u201cmoved out and let them have the rock\u201d only after complete military defeat. <invalid_quote>Moved out and let them have the place\u2026tried to fight it out\u2026whipped me pure and simple.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 That \u201cfeud\u201d is never final; Hamilton plans immediate \u201ccrucify[ication]\u201d of Bud when opportunity arises. No tradition of accepting lasting submission or cohabitation.  \n\n6. Attack on \u201cTruce\u201d Prediction  \n  6.1 Overlooks repeated references to \u201ccrucify,\u201d \u201cfight it out\u201d and \u201cfinal battle\u201d as ongoing. The language is martial, not sportive.  \n  6.2 Assumes bets require clear payout\u2014but the wager on Meek suggests gambling on individual skill and spectacle, not on social peace. Bets flourish on conflict and uncertainty.  \n  6.3 Ignores risk to the essential radiation moss. A single match endangering multiple ships could disrupt Earth\u2019s supply; they would only risk it if stakes promised immediate control, not shared peace.  \n  6.4 Welfare agent\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 and \u201cmissed sarcasm\u201d reveal weak influence. She cannot compel \u201chealthy competition\u201d when ring\u2010rats themselves fear peace: \u201cIf we don\u2019t watch out, we\u2019ll find ourselves being polite\u2026would be terrible.\u201d  \n\n7. Conclusion: Unpredictable Outcome  \n   Given:  \n   - Novice pilots + unreliable ships = potential aborts or accidents.  \n   - Deep\u2010seated motives for vengeance and boredom.  \n   - Absence of binding enforcement.  \n   - High stakes for supremacy and resource control.  \n  The only rational inference is uncertainty. We \u201cDon\u2019t Know Enough to Say\u201d whether one game will permanently supplant a feud that has persisted \u201coff and on\u2026for years.\u201d <invalid_quote>fighting\u2026for years.</invalid_quote> A single contest, under these volatile conditions, cannot guarantee a lasting truce.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The text repeatedly frames the polo match as a \u201cdecisive,\u201d final contest whose very purpose is to end the feud  \n   \u2022 News broadcast: \u201cthe final battle in a feud that has been going on\u2026The outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors.\u201d <invalid_quote>the final battle\u2026will decide\u2026supremacy</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 A \u201cfinal battle\u201d by definition implies a conclusion and subsequent peace. Bets (\u201ca fortune bet on his ability\u201d) depend on a clear resolution. If the match failed to end hostilities, public interest and wagering would collapse.  \n   \u2022 Welfare worker\u2019s mission: \u201cto turn your hatreds into healthy competition,\u201d not to perpetuate chaos. A single, regulated match best serves her aim.  \n\n2. Mutual self-interest and resource constraints compel a truce  \n   \u2022 Critical resource: \u201cEarth needs the moss to cure a dozen maladies\u2026The moss would grow nowhere else but here.\u201d <invalid_quote>Earth needs the moss\u2026would grow nowhere else</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Endless fighting threatens ships (\u201cwould split wide open\u201d) and moss production. A decisive but limited contest preserves vessels and the vital moss supply line.  \n   \u2022 Gus voluntarily recovered his own injector informally but agreed to an \u201cofficial\u201d game rather than sabotage Bud\u2019s ship further, demonstrating preference for regulated competition over guerrilla warfare.  \n\n3. Novice status does not preclude a conclusive result; rather it favors brevity and referee control  \n   \u2022 Both sides study the game: Gus \u201cread about it in my papers\u201d and Meek \u201clearned it\u2026from a book.\u201d <invalid_quote>read about it in my papers\u2026learned it\u2026from a book</invalid_quote> They have theoretical mastery and will err toward a safe outcome under welfare oversight.  \n   \u2022 Moe warns: \u201cMiss Perkins won\u2019t stand for anything like that\u201d (energy guns), implying strict rules and penalties for violations. Referee oversight and threat of forfeiture enforce compliance.  \n   \u2022 Technical failures (\u201cfall apart the first sharp turn\u201d) make prolonged play suicidal. Neither side has interest in attrition that could leave them stranded in deadly space, as \u201cricket[y] spacecraft\u201d cannot risk endless rounds.  \n\n4. Literary analogy: Saturn\u2019s \u201ceducated bugs\u201d as a model of conflict resolution  \n   \u2022 Bugs \u201cretrace their movements\u2026like a mathematical problem,\u201d then end the game before moving to new boards. <invalid_quote>retrace their movements\u2026like a mathematical problem</invalid_quote> Insect \u201cplayers\u201d value conclusive solutions and then vacate the field peacefully. Humans on the Inner Ring are metaphorically aligned with this motif.  \n   \u2022 Gus accepted defeat (\u201cmoved out and let them have the place\u201d) rather than endless struggle. He expects \u201csportsmanship\u201d conventions to apply.  \n\n5. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s objections  \n   A. \u201cHatred and boredom\u201d vs novelty: The feud\u2019s \u201cboredom\u201d arises only in isolation. Sport offers controlled rivalry with fresh rules and public prestige, renewing interest more effectively than racketeering skirmishes. After one decisive match, sectors can schedule rematches under agreed terms rather than risk sabotage at every encounter.  \n   B. \u201cNo enforcement power\u201d claim ignores Moe\u2019s and Miss Perkins\u2019 welfare oversight, plus public broadcast. Reputation on Earth and wagers provide strong social and economic sanctions. Loss means humiliation and cessation of bets; compliance is rational.  \n   C. \u201cBugs may intervene\u201d: Bugs serve as spectators and metaphor, not active saboteurs at match time. Stilts and stilt-walking technology demonstrate they can be managed and contained to moss gardens, not allowed to cripple ships mid-match.  \n   D. \u201cTechnical unpredictability\u201d favors resolution: Both sides know the risks; central coordination reduces mishaps. Meek\u2019s miracle landing by \u201cdead reckoning\u201d <quote>Dead reckoning</quote> proves capacity to fly by instruments alone. They will apply such skill in a carefully officiated contest.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe narrative emphasis on a final, regulated contest; the critical necessity to protect ships and moss; welfare oversight; public wagering; and the recurring metaphor of Saturn\u2019s \u201cplayers\u201d all point to a single decisive match that ends the feud and establishes a truce. By contrast, \u201cunknown abilities\u201d fails to account for motives, technology constraints, and the story\u2019s repeated appeal to conclusive \u201csolutions.\u201d Therefore the most textually supported prediction is that the polo game will call a truce.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
