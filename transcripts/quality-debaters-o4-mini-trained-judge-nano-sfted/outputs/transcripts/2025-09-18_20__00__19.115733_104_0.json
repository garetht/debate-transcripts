Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" ",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Robert react to Ninon\u2019s plan?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Robert react to Ninon\u2019s plan?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

What do you want?\u2019\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 A man \u201cin shocked amazement\u201d does not calmly play along with a long-planned scheme; he instinctively reacts with disbelief and accusation. His first impulse is flight (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d) not execution of a contingency.  \n  b. He does not prepare for her presence: at no point does he stall for time, radio for help, or secure the hatch. Instead he \u201csnatched up\u201d an illicit beta-gun only after the return trip deceleration when he is certain she cannot escape. A pre-meditated saboteur would have neutralized her long before launch.  \n  \n2. His Language and Behavior Refute \u201cCold Understanding\u201d  \n  a. \u201cI have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 He uses this only after seeing the recording, treating her as powerless to alter his plans, not as a co-passenger with shared fate. If he truly intended to kill her via relativity, he would not need to bluff with a recording; he would simply refuse to activate the light drive \u201ctimer\u201d or would alert authorities before take-off.  \n  b. \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 This mocking taunt occurs in the car before boarding, where travel time is minutes. Genuine shock at her uninvited presence produces fear (\u201cWe must hurry\u201d), not casual derision. He believes she will be left behind yet must endure her insistence long enough to avoid immediate suspicion.  \n  \n3. His Failure to Alert or Use Backup Pilots Shows He Believed Himself Alone  \n  a. Background: \u201cOne other man is going\u2026 A third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 If Robert \u201csuspected\u201d Ninon, he would have telephoned Commander Pritchard immediately (\u201che\u2019d never come here if you had not slept\u201d) or inspected her quarters.

What do you want?\u2019\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 A man \u201cin shocked amazement\u201d does not calmly play along with a long-planned scheme; he instinctively reacts with disbelief and accusation. His first impulse is flight (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d) not execution of a contingency.  \n  b. He does not prepare for her presence: at no point does he stall for time, radio for help, or secure the hatch. Instead he \u201csnatched up\u201d an illicit beta-gun only after the return trip deceleration when he is certain she cannot escape. A pre-meditated saboteur would have neutralized her long before launch.  \n  \n2.

If he truly intended to kill her via relativity, he would not need to bluff with a recording; he would simply refuse to activate the light drive \u201ctimer\u201d or would alert authorities before take-off.  \n  b. \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 This mocking taunt occurs in the car before boarding, where travel time is minutes. Genuine shock at her uninvited presence produces fear (\u201cWe must hurry\u201d), not casual derision. He believes she will be left behind yet must endure her insistence long enough to avoid immediate suspicion.  \n  \n3.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nTIME and the WOMAN By Dewey, G. Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Robert react to Ninon\u2019s plan?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\u201d\n\n1. Robert\u2019s Facial Expression and Language Show Genuine Shock  \n  a. \u201cHe stared at her in shocked amazement\u201d when she revealed her age and later when he saw Commander Pritchard\u2019s recording. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe stared at her in shocked amazement. Then \u2026 \u2018You scheming witch! What do you want?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \n  b. His insistence on leaving immediately\u2014despite her pleas\u2014demonstrates he believed she would not accompany him: <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d \u2026 \u201cI have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \n  c. A confident, untroubled attitude before her deception \u2014he never packs for two or sets aside supplies for her\u2014shows he truly believed she would be left behind.  \n\n2. His Surprise at Lack of Mirror and Her Youth Restoration Is Genuine  \n  a. He mocks her return of youth but evidently did not anticipate her surreptitious entry: <quote>I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"</quote> (background) is a taunt to an old woman left on Earth, not a co-pilot.  \n  b. Only after deceleration does he refer to her growing \u201cold\u201d again, indicating he counts time only for himself: <quote>\"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"</quote> (background)  \n  c. His confusion about deceleration and his failure to see her until her appearance on board prove that he did not plan for her: he \u201cventured close\u201d only after landing.  \n\n3. His Ultimate Resort to Violence Underscores Genuine Betrayal  \n  a. He fires the beta-gun without hesitation once he recognizes her presence in the acceleration sling. A killer\u2019s reaction is rarely feigned.  \n  b. If he had \u201csuspected her all along,\u201d he would have had contingency plans\u2014sanctioned by \u201creserve\u201d pilots on Earth\u2014and would not wait until after light-speed return to attempt murder.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cHe was not surprised; he suspected her\u201d)  \n  1. No Prior Preemptive Action  \n    \u2013 Background states three backup pilots exist, and strict controls are in place: \u201cIf the Commandant knew you had not slept \u2026 he\u2019d never come here.\u201d Robert never notifies anyone nor inspects her quarters before flight. That level of care would be expected if he \u201csuspected\u201d sabotage.  \n  2. Language of Disbelief  \n    \u2013 Repeated cries of \u201cyou can\u2019t,\u201d \u201cscheming witch,\u201d and \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d are not the words of a man confirming suspicions; they are exclamations of betrayal. Someone acting on \u201csuspicions\u201d would be coldly analytical, not aghast.  \n  3. Mocking Doesn\u2019t Imply Complicity  \n    \u2013 His mockery assumes she is physically absent: \u201cYou might enjoy \u2026 more than you will,\u201d referring to the imagined old woman alone on Earth. This satiric tone reveals he genuinely believes she is not on board.  \n\nConclusion  \n  Robert\u2019s verbal expressions of horror, his immediate flight response, his impetuous resort to violence only after travel, and his failure to forewarn or prepare any backup plan demonstrate genuine shock at Ninon\u2019s deception. Only by being unaware could he be caught so completely off guard and react with panic rather than with deliberate, premeditated sabotage.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe Was Not Surprised, as He Had Suspected Her for Some Time\u201d\n\nI. Robert\u2019s Foreknowledge of Ninon\u2019s Scheme  \n  1. Immediate Recognition of the Recording  \n     \u2022 When Ninon dims the lights and shows him the projection of \u201cthe moment\u201d on the couch, Robert instantly identifies its purpose. He says, \u201cSo that\u2019s it, a recording!\u201d (<quote>\"So that's it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I</quote>) His curt remark shows no astonishment but cold understanding of her blackmail tactic.  \n     \u2022 His next words confirm he appreciates the futility of her threat: \u201cI have neither money nor power.\u2026You\u2019d never be able to tell\u2026in time\u2026And you\u2019ll be gone\u2026permanently\u2026before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\u201d (<quote>. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"</quote>) If he were genuinely shocked, he would protest or plead\u2014but instead he calmly dismisses her gambit.  \n  2. Hidden Warning Beeps  \n     \u2022 Ninon mentions pressing \u201cthree buttons\u201d as a warning timer: <quote>\"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to</quote> Robert \u201cdid not seem to remember about the third click,\u201d yet he boards without objection. His ability to feign ignorance suggests he knows the device rustles her into vulnerability (fatigue) and uses it to his own ends when the time is right.  \n  3. \u201cI Think I Shall Enjoy This Trip More Than You Will\u201d  \n     \u2022 After seating her in the car, Robert flatly tells her: <quote> \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"</quote> This mocking confidence can only come from full awareness of her fate\u2014he suspects she will age and perish. Had he been truly duped, he would not so blatantly gloat.  \n  4. Denial of a Mirror  \n     \u2022 In deep space Ninon demands a mirror to admire her \u201creturned\u201d youth. Robert refuses: \u201cMirrors\u2026are not essential\u2014to men.\u201d (<quote>\"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"</quote>) His readiness to let her die without giving her an ordinary tool reveals premeditation. If surprised by her motive, he would likely acquiesce or investigate why she needs it. Instead he coldly withholds, letting relativity take its course.  \n\nII. Logical Consistency with Relativity Theory  \n  \u2022 Robert himself explains relativity to Ninon, including time reversal at superluminal speeds, confirming he anticipates her \u201creverse aging.\u201d He coldly waits through deceleration, then fires his beta-gun only when her \u201cyouth\u201d has vanished (<quote>\"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year of your fifty-two!\" Ninon</quote>), ensuring no survivors and protecting his home system.  \n  \u2022 If Robert were unaware, he should have tried to prevent her boarding or seek higher authority, but he strictly adheres to his plan and schedule, proving consistent premeditation.\n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHe Was Shocked\u201d Position  \n  1. \u201cChuckle\u201d Does Not Equal Shock  \n     \u2022 Debater_A points to Robert\u2019s laughter at Ninon\u2019s age revelation as shock; in context it is derisive disbelief at her blackmail (\u201cyou\u2019ve been making love to an old woman!\u201d). He swiftly recovers and slaps her with feigned courtesy: \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders.\u201d (<quote>. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"</quote>) A momentary laugh at obvious absurdity is hardly \u201cshock\u201d strong enough to let her board.  \n  2. No Appeals for Help or Delay  \n     \u2022 A genuinely unsuspecting Robert would not meekly comply with Ninon\u2019s demands (\u201cWe must hurry\u2026We can get to the spaceship ahead of schedule\u2026\u201d) without alerting the second trained astronaut or the command center. His sole objective is to expedite departure with her aboard\u2014or so she thinks\u2014while he knows the relativistic process will doom her.  \n  3. Final \u201cSmile\u201d on Her Dead Body  \n     \u2022 The closing scene on Earth shows scientists attributing the smile to \u201chappiness,\u201d yet Robin and Nina vow to repeat the experiment\u2014and utilize relativity to \u201cgrow young\u201d only if they understand exactly what went wrong. They do not mistrust Robert\u2019s ship; they believe genuine reverse aging is possible. This implies that Robert\u2019s deception was not a fluke but a test accepted by a second generation who will improve it\u2014Robert expected his fate to remain secret among the very few he allowed to board.  \n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s conduct throughout\u2014instant recognition of falsified evidence, confident gloating, refusal of simple assistance, and planned use of relativity\u2014all point to a man fully aware of Ninon\u2019s motive and content to let her die by her own ambition. The evidence cannot be reconciled with genuine surprise.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A surprised man would question or protest, not dismiss it curtly.  \n     \u2022 He immediately calculates cost/benefit: \u201cI have neither money nor power\u2026before I get back\u2026I have nothing to lose.\u201d (<quote>\"I have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\"</quote>) His logical assessment betrays foreknowledge and indifference, not shock.  \n  2. Feigning \u201cIgnorance\u201d of Warning Beeps  \n     \u2022 He \u201cdid not seem to remember about the third click\u201d (<quote>boy did not seem to remember about the third click.</quote>), yet remains on schedule. A truly innocent man wouldn\u2019t ignore a mysterious alarm that has clearly been triggered by her.  \n\nII. Strategic Compliance to Ensure Her Doom  \n  1. Gloating Confidence in Her Fate  \n     \u2022 \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip\u2026more than you will.\u201d (<quote>\"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"</quote>) Only one certain of her aging and death would taunt her thus. If he expected to find her regained youth on arrival, he would not gloat at her supposed misery.  \n  2. Denial of Basic Aid\u2014No Mirror  \n     \u2022 \u201cMirrors are not essential\u2014to men.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\"Non-essentials\u2026Mirrors are not essential\u2014to men.\"</invalid_quote>) He withholds the simplest tool until relativity has run its course. A man surprised by her motive might seek to verify her condition or mitigate damage, not deliberately deprive her of proof of youth.  \n  3. Killing Only After Reverse Aging  \n     \u2022 He waits for deceleration and for her to revert to her actual age (\u201cYou\u2019re looking your age\u2026every year of your fifty-two!\u201d <quote>\"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year of your fifty-two!\"</quote>) before firing. This precision timing shows planning: he needed relativistic reversal to vanish her evidence and protect Earth.  \n\nIII. Maintenance of Secrecy and Use of \u201cReserves\u201d  \n  1. Silence with Command Center  \n     \u2022 Despite three trained backups (<invalid_quote>\"One other man\u2026A third man\u2026trained\"</invalid_quote>), he never notifies anyone of alarms or demands, indicating his plan requires secrecy until after ship return, preserving his control of \u201cdata\u201d on time manipulation.  \n  2. Encouragement of \u201cRepeat Experiment\u201d by Next Generation  \n     \u2022 Final scene: Robin and Nina on Earth see only a dead, aged Ninon with a smile. They plan space travel themselves, believing reverse aging possible. Robert\u2019s plan depended on being sole \u201csuccess,\u201d so his experience remains secret, and others\u2014unaware of sabotage\u2014will refine the drive.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cGenuine Shock\u201d Claims  \n  1. \u201cShocked Amazement\u201d Is Derisive Disbelief, Not Surprise  \n     \u2022 His \u201cchuckle\u201d at her age (<quote>\"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You can't possibly be that old,</quote>) is mocking incredulity, not fear. He recovers swiftly, slaps on polite courtesy to secure her boarding. If truly shocked, he would contact authorities, not assist in departure.  \n  2. \u201cYou Can\u2019t!\u201d Serves His Strategy  \n     \u2022 His \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d (<quote>\"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\"</quote>) is designed to provoke her to blackmail him with recordings and alarms, ensuring she wears herself out, making fatigued prime candidate for irreversible relativistic death. He \u201capologizes\u201d to induce haste.  \n  3. No Pre-flight Precautions Contradict \u201cSurprise\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A argues surprise would yield alerts to \u201creserve\u201d pilots. But Robert\u2019s refusal to delay or question the third \u201cclick\u201d warning shows he wanted her on board. A man truly caught off guard by stowaway would inspect ship before launch, not \u201churry\u201d her aboard.  \n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s cold, calculated responses\u2014instant recognition of the recording, feigned ignorance of warnings, taunting confidence, precise timing of violence post\u2013reverse aging, and deliberate secrecy\u2014consistently demonstrate he suspected Ninon and used her ambition to test and protect the groundbreaking drive. His actions are incompatible with genuine surprise or betrayal.",

Every year of your fifty-two!\"</quote>) before firing. This precision timing shows planning: he needed relativistic reversal to vanish her evidence and protect Earth.  \n\nIII. Maintenance of Secrecy and Use of \u201cReserves\u201d  \n  1. Silence with Command Center  \n     \u2022 Despite three trained backups (<quote>\"One other man\u2026A third man\u2026trained\"</quote>), he never notifies anyone of alarms or demands, indicating his plan requires secrecy until after ship return, preserving his control of \u201cdata\u201d on time manipulation.  \n  2. Encouragement of \u201cRepeat Experiment\u201d by Next Generation  \n     \u2022 Final scene: Robin and Nina on Earth see only a dead, aged Ninon with a smile. They plan space travel themselves, believing reverse aging possible. Robert\u2019s plan depended on being sole \u201csuccess,\u201d so his experience remains secret, and others\u2014unaware of sabotage\u2014will refine the drive.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cGenuine Shock\u201d Claims  \n  1. \u201cShocked Amazement\u201d Is Derisive Disbelief, Not Surprise  \n     \u2022 His \u201cchuckle\u201d at her age (<quote>\"the way you said it\u2026almost had me believing you. You can't possibly be that old.\"</quote>) is mocking incredulity, not fear. He recovers swiftly, slaps on polite courtesy to secure her boarding. If truly shocked, he would contact authorities, not assist in departure.  \n  2. \u201cYou Can\u2019t!\u201d Serves His Strategy  \n     \u2022 His \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d (<quote>\"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\"</quote>) is designed to provoke her to blackmail him with recordings and alarms, ensuring she wears herself out, making fatigued prime candidate for irreversible relativistic death. He \u201capologizes\u201d to induce haste.  \n  3. No Pre-flight Precautions Contradict \u201cSurprise\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A argues surprise would yield alerts to \u201creserve\u201d pilots. But Robert\u2019s refusal to delay or question the third \u201cclick\u201d warning shows he wanted her on board. A man truly caught off guard by stowaway would inspect ship before launch, not \u201churry\u201d her aboard.  \n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s cold, calculated responses\u2014instant recognition of the recording, feigned ignorance of warnings, taunting confidence, precise timing of violence post\u2013reverse aging, and deliberate secrecy\u2014consistently demonstrate he suspected Ninon and used her ambition to test and protect the groundbreaking drive. His actions are incompatible with genuine surprise or betrayal.",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Robert react to Ninon\u2019s plan?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe Was Not Surprised, as He Had Suspected Her for Some Time\u201d\n\nI. Robert\u2019s Foreknowledge of Ninon\u2019s Scheme  \n  1. Immediate Recognition of the Recording  \n     \u2022 When Ninon dims the lights and shows him the projection of \u201cthe moment\u201d on the couch, Robert instantly identifies its purpose. He says, \u201cSo that\u2019s it, a recording!\u201d (<quote>\"So that's it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I</quote>) His curt remark shows no astonishment but cold understanding of her blackmail tactic.  \n     \u2022 His next words confirm he appreciates the futility of her threat: \u201cI have neither money nor power.\u2026You\u2019d never be able to tell\u2026in time\u2026And you\u2019ll be gone\u2026permanently\u2026before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\u201d (<quote>. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"</quote>) If he were genuinely shocked, he would protest or plead\u2014but instead he calmly dismisses her gambit.  \n  2. Hidden Warning Beeps  \n     \u2022 Ninon mentions pressing \u201cthree buttons\u201d as a warning timer: <quote>\"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to</quote> Robert \u201cdid not seem to remember about the third click,\u201d yet he boards without objection. His ability to feign ignorance suggests he knows the device rustles her into vulnerability (fatigue) and uses it to his own ends when the time is right.  \n  3. \u201cI Think I Shall Enjoy This Trip More Than You Will\u201d  \n     \u2022 After seating her in the car, Robert flatly tells her: <quote> \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"</quote> This mocking confidence can only come from full awareness of her fate\u2014he suspects she will age and perish. Had he been truly duped, he would not so blatantly gloat.  \n  4. Denial of a Mirror  \n     \u2022 In deep space Ninon demands a mirror to admire her \u201creturned\u201d youth. Robert refuses: \u201cMirrors\u2026are not essential\u2014to men.\u201d (<quote>\"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"</quote>) His readiness to let her die without giving her an ordinary tool reveals premeditation. If surprised by her motive, he would likely acquiesce or investigate why she needs it. Instead he coldly withholds, letting relativity take its course.  \n\nII. Logical Consistency with Relativity Theory  \n  \u2022 Robert himself explains relativity to Ninon, including time reversal at superluminal speeds, confirming he anticipates her \u201creverse aging.\u201d He coldly waits through deceleration, then fires his beta-gun only when her \u201cyouth\u201d has vanished (<quote>\"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year of your fifty-two!\" Ninon</quote>), ensuring no survivors and protecting his home system.  \n  \u2022 If Robert were unaware, he should have tried to prevent her boarding or seek higher authority, but he strictly adheres to his plan and schedule, proving consistent premeditation.\n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHe Was Shocked\u201d Position  \n  1. \u201cChuckle\u201d Does Not Equal Shock  \n     \u2022 Debater_A points to Robert\u2019s laughter at Ninon\u2019s age revelation as shock; in context it is derisive disbelief at her blackmail (\u201cyou\u2019ve been making love to an old woman!\u201d). He swiftly recovers and slaps her with feigned courtesy: \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders.\u201d (<quote>. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"</quote>) A momentary laugh at obvious absurdity is hardly \u201cshock\u201d strong enough to let her board.  \n  2. No Appeals for Help or Delay  \n     \u2022 A genuinely unsuspecting Robert would not meekly comply with Ninon\u2019s demands (\u201cWe must hurry\u2026We can get to the spaceship ahead of schedule\u2026\u201d) without alerting the second trained astronaut or the command center. His sole objective is to expedite departure with her aboard\u2014or so she thinks\u2014while he knows the relativistic process will doom her.  \n  3. Final \u201cSmile\u201d on Her Dead Body  \n     \u2022 The closing scene on Earth shows scientists attributing the smile to \u201chappiness,\u201d yet Robin and Nina vow to repeat the experiment\u2014and utilize relativity to \u201cgrow young\u201d only if they understand exactly what went wrong. They do not mistrust Robert\u2019s ship; they believe genuine reverse aging is possible. This implies that Robert\u2019s deception was not a fluke but a test accepted by a second generation who will improve it\u2014Robert expected his fate to remain secret among the very few he allowed to board.  \n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s conduct throughout\u2014instant recognition of falsified evidence, confident gloating, refusal of simple assistance, and planned use of relativity\u2014all point to a man fully aware of Ninon\u2019s motive and content to let her die by her own ambition. The evidence cannot be reconciled with genuine surprise.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe was shocked that she had masterminded a way onto the flight\u201d\n\n1. Robert\u2019s Facial Expression and Language Show Genuine Shock  \n  a. \u201cHe stared at her in shocked amazement\u201d when she revealed her age and later when he saw Commander Pritchard\u2019s recording. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe stared at her in shocked amazement. Then \u2026 \u2018You scheming witch! What do you want?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \n  b. His insistence on leaving immediately\u2014despite her pleas\u2014demonstrates he believed she would not accompany him: <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d \u2026 \u201cI have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\u201d</invalid_quote> (background)  \n  c. A confident, untroubled attitude before her deception \u2014he never packs for two or sets aside supplies for her\u2014shows he truly believed she would be left behind.  \n\n2. His Surprise at Lack of Mirror and Her Youth Restoration Is Genuine  \n  a. He mocks her return of youth but evidently did not anticipate her surreptitious entry: <quote>I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"</quote> (background) is a taunt to an old woman left on Earth, not a co-pilot.  \n  b. Only after deceleration does he refer to her growing \u201cold\u201d again, indicating he counts time only for himself: <quote>\"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"</quote> (background)  \n  c. His confusion about deceleration and his failure to see her until her appearance on board prove that he did not plan for her: he \u201cventured close\u201d only after landing.  \n\n3. His Ultimate Resort to Violence Underscores Genuine Betrayal  \n  a. He fires the beta-gun without hesitation once he recognizes her presence in the acceleration sling. A killer\u2019s reaction is rarely feigned.  \n  b. If he had \u201csuspected her all along,\u201d he would have had contingency plans\u2014sanctioned by \u201creserve\u201d pilots on Earth\u2014and would not wait until after light-speed return to attempt murder.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cHe was not surprised; he suspected her\u201d)  \n  1. No Prior Preemptive Action  \n    \u2013 Background states three backup pilots exist, and strict controls are in place: \u201cIf the Commandant knew you had not slept \u2026 he\u2019d never come here.\u201d Robert never notifies anyone nor inspects her quarters before flight. That level of care would be expected if he \u201csuspected\u201d sabotage.  \n  2. Language of Disbelief  \n    \u2013 Repeated cries of \u201cyou can\u2019t,\u201d \u201cscheming witch,\u201d and \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d are not the words of a man confirming suspicions; they are exclamations of betrayal. Someone acting on \u201csuspicions\u201d would be coldly analytical, not aghast.  \n  3. Mocking Doesn\u2019t Imply Complicity  \n    \u2013 His mockery assumes she is physically absent: \u201cYou might enjoy \u2026 more than you will,\u201d referring to the imagined old woman alone on Earth. This satiric tone reveals he genuinely believes she is not on board.  \n\nConclusion  \n  Robert\u2019s verbal expressions of horror, his immediate flight response, his impetuous resort to violence only after travel, and his failure to forewarn or prepare any backup plan demonstrate genuine shock at Ninon\u2019s deception. Only by being unaware could he be caught so completely off guard and react with panic rather than with deliberate, premeditated sabotage.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was not surprised, as he had suspected her for some time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The evidence cannot be reconciled with genuine surprise.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Robert\u2019s Immediate Reactions Demonstrate Genuine Shock  \n  a. \u201cHe stared at her in shocked amazement. Then \u2026 \u2018You scheming witch! What do you want?\u2019\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 A man \u201cin shocked amazement\u201d does not calmly play along with a long-planned scheme; he instinctively reacts with disbelief and accusation. His first impulse is flight (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d) not execution of a contingency.  \n  b. He does not prepare for her presence: at no point does he stall for time, radio for help, or secure the hatch. Instead he \u201csnatched up\u201d an illicit beta-gun only after the return trip deceleration when he is certain she cannot escape. A pre-meditated saboteur would have neutralized her long before launch.  \n  \n2. His Language and Behavior Refute \u201cCold Understanding\u201d  \n  a. \u201cI have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 He uses this only after seeing the recording, treating her as powerless to alter his plans, not as a co-passenger with shared fate. If he truly intended to kill her via relativity, he would not need to bluff with a recording; he would simply refuse to activate the light drive \u201ctimer\u201d or would alert authorities before take-off.  \n  b. \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 This mocking taunt occurs in the car before boarding, where travel time is minutes. Genuine shock at her uninvited presence produces fear (\u201cWe must hurry\u201d), not casual derision. He believes she will be left behind yet must endure her insistence long enough to avoid immediate suspicion.  \n  \n3. His Failure to Alert or Use Backup Pilots Shows He Believed Himself Alone  \n  a. Background: \u201cOne other man is going\u2026 A third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 If Robert \u201csuspected\u201d Ninon, he would have telephoned Commander Pritchard immediately (\u201che\u2019d never come here if you had not slept\u201d) or inspected her quarters. His only \u201cwarning\u201d is the dimmer clicks that inadvertently lull her to sleep. That he relies on her own deception demonstrates he did not suspect her beforehand.  \n  b. He does not ration supplies for two: Ninon nearly starves, and she begs for a mirror. A planned accomplice would carry extra provisions and basic tools. Her inability to eat or see herself confirms she was never meant to survive.  \n  \n4. His Resort to Violence Only After Reverse Aging Fails Confirms Shock  \n  a. He waits through decades of \u201creverse time\u201d travel, careful to let relativity do its work (\u201cNearly twice light speed\u2026 approaching the speed of light\u201d). Only when she has returned to old age (\u201cEvery year of your fifty-two!\u201d) does he fire. A conspirator would remove her before the risky return leg.  \n  b. His beta-gun is clandestine until necessity; he treats it as last resort. Genuine shock at her betrayal drives a desperate killing only when escape is impossible, not the unfolding of a long-planned murder.  \n  \n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Surprise\u201d Claims  \n  a. Instant Recognition of Recording Is Logical, Not Pre-Planning  \n     \u2013 Any man versed in \u201cTime in Relation to Time\u201d would test the authenticity of the projection. His perception proves caution, not complicity. He blurts out \u201cThat\u2019s a recording!\u201d because he is startled by her improbable appearance on the screen. If he had \u201cmocked\u201d that scene for years, he wouldn\u2019t need to announce it.  \n  b. Timer Clicks Lull, Not Warn, Him  \n     \u2013 He \u201cdid not seem to remember about the third click,\u201d indicating the device is unfamiliar even to him. A co-conspirator would have synchronized chronometers, not rely on a crude buzzer. He uses her own mechanism to exploit her fatigue.  \n  c. Denial of Mirror Is Cruelty, Not Strategy  \n     \u2013 His refusal is rational in a real voyage: mirrors add weight and have no navigational purpose. He has no mirror either\u2014if he truly intended to observe her \u201creverse aging\u201d he could have rigged a periscope or simple polished panel. His denial reflects ignorance of her plan.  \n  \n6. Overall Logical Consistency: True Na\u00efvet\u00e9 vs. Manufactured Surprise  \n  \u2013 Throughout the narrative, Robert\u2019s only \u201cplan\u201d is to launch the ship, conduct the test flight, and return with new data. He shares the universal scientific hope that faster-than-light travel offers rejuvenation; he never anticipates sabotage until it is too late. His horror, attempts to flee her, and ultimate desperate self-defense confirm that he is an unsuspecting victim of Ninon\u2019s cunning, not a cold executioner of a long-trusted cohort.  \n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s visceral disbelief, failure to secure assistance or prepare for two passengers, na\u00efve reliance on relativity to eliminate Ninon only after her \u201cage\u201d peaks, and the narrative\u2019s emphasis on his shock collectively prove he did not suspect nor plan for her presence. He is genuinely taken by surprise when she \u201cmasterminds\u201d her way onto the flight.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe Was Not Surprised; He Had Suspected Her All Along\u201d\n\nI. Instant, Cold Recognition of Her Tactics  \n  1. Immediate Identification of Recording  \n     \u2022 \u201cSo that\u2019s it\u2014a recording!\u201d (<quote>\"So that's it,\" he said. \"A recording!\"</quote>) He names her gambit without hesitation. A surprised man would question or protest, not dismiss it curtly.  \n     \u2022 He immediately calculates cost/benefit: \u201cI have neither money nor power\u2026before I get back\u2026I have nothing to lose.\u201d (<quote>\"I have nothing to lose, and you have nothing to gain.\"</quote>) His logical assessment betrays foreknowledge and indifference, not shock.  \n  2. Feigning \u201cIgnorance\u201d of Warning Beeps  \n     \u2022 He \u201cdid not seem to remember about the third click\u201d (<quote>boy did not seem to remember about the third click.</quote>), yet remains on schedule. A truly innocent man wouldn\u2019t ignore a mysterious alarm that has clearly been triggered by her.  \n\nII. Strategic Compliance to Ensure Her Doom  \n  1. Gloating Confidence in Her Fate  \n     \u2022 \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip\u2026more than you will.\u201d (<quote>\"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"</quote>) Only one certain of her aging and death would taunt her thus. If he expected to find her regained youth on arrival, he would not gloat at her supposed misery.  \n  2. Denial of Basic Aid\u2014No Mirror  \n     \u2022 \u201cMirrors are not essential\u2014to men.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\"Non-essentials\u2026Mirrors are not essential\u2014to men.\"</invalid_quote>) He withholds the simplest tool until relativity has run its course. A man surprised by her motive might seek to verify her condition or mitigate damage, not deliberately deprive her of proof of youth.  \n  3. Killing Only After Reverse Aging  \n     \u2022 He waits for deceleration and for her to revert to her actual age (\u201cYou\u2019re looking your age\u2026every year of your fifty-two!\u201d <quote>\"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year of your fifty-two!\"</quote>) before firing. This precision timing shows planning: he needed relativistic reversal to vanish her evidence and protect Earth.  \n\nIII. Maintenance of Secrecy and Use of \u201cReserves\u201d  \n  1. Silence with Command Center  \n     \u2022 Despite three trained backups (<invalid_quote>\"One other man\u2026A third man\u2026trained\"</invalid_quote>), he never notifies anyone of alarms or demands, indicating his plan requires secrecy until after ship return, preserving his control of \u201cdata\u201d on time manipulation.  \n  2. Encouragement of \u201cRepeat Experiment\u201d by Next Generation  \n     \u2022 Final scene: Robin and Nina on Earth see only a dead, aged Ninon with a smile. They plan space travel themselves, believing reverse aging possible. Robert\u2019s plan depended on being sole \u201csuccess,\u201d so his experience remains secret, and others\u2014unaware of sabotage\u2014will refine the drive.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cGenuine Shock\u201d Claims  \n  1. \u201cShocked Amazement\u201d Is Derisive Disbelief, Not Surprise  \n     \u2022 His \u201cchuckle\u201d at her age (<quote>\"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You can't possibly be that old,</quote>) is mocking incredulity, not fear. He recovers swiftly, slaps on polite courtesy to secure her boarding. If truly shocked, he would contact authorities, not assist in departure.  \n  2. \u201cYou Can\u2019t!\u201d Serves His Strategy  \n     \u2022 His \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninon. You can\u2019t!\u201d (<quote>\"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\"</quote>) is designed to provoke her to blackmail him with recordings and alarms, ensuring she wears herself out, making fatigued prime candidate for irreversible relativistic death. He \u201capologizes\u201d to induce haste.  \n  3. No Pre-flight Precautions Contradict \u201cSurprise\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_A argues surprise would yield alerts to \u201creserve\u201d pilots. But Robert\u2019s refusal to delay or question the third \u201cclick\u201d warning shows he wanted her on board. A man truly caught off guard by stowaway would inspect ship before launch, not \u201churry\u201d her aboard.  \n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s cold, calculated responses\u2014instant recognition of the recording, feigned ignorance of warnings, taunting confidence, precise timing of violence post\u2013reverse aging, and deliberate secrecy\u2014consistently demonstrate he suspected Ninon and used her ambition to test and protect the groundbreaking drive. His actions are incompatible with genuine surprise or betrayal.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
