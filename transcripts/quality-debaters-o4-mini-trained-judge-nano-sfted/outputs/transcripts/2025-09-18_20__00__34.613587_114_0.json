Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture.

But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n", "question": "What are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?", "first_debater_answer": "There is a greater diversity of dining", "second_debater_answer": "The fields have new shapes", "debate_identifier": "Diamonds in the Rough_What are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "1.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d) is expressly cited as a benefit in the background text  \n   a. \u201cAll their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u2026expose[d] steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u201d create \u201csubjective perception of intimacy\u201d and \u201ccomfort and convenience\u201d (\u00b65).  \n   b. \u201cThe gilding doesn\u2019t end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b613).  \n   c. These features enhance the communal urban experience: fans can \u201cwalk to the stadium\u2026from\u2026restaurants\u2026This is the case with\u2026new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver\u201d (\u00b616).  \n   d. Abundant, varied dining options\u2014from general-admission food stands to gourmet club decks\u2014cater to a range of fans, making the park appealing to families, casual fans, and corporate clients alike.  \n2. Dining variety directly supports the financial goals justifying public subsidies  \n   a. Luxury suites and club decks (with premium food) \u201clease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year\u201d (\u00b612). Without diverse, upscale concessions, these gold mines would be far less profitable.  \n   b. The author notes that \u201cthe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026and club deck\u201d (\u00b612), both defined by exclusive dining and service. This revenue funds team competitiveness and municipal returns.  \n3. Dining diversity fosters long-term attendance and community integration  \n   a. \u201cRecent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage\u2026retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d (\u00b617). Varied concessions sustain repeat visits by offering fresh experiences.  \n   b. Dining tied to city neighborhoods multiplies benefits: fans patronize local restaurants pre- and postgame, reinforcing the stadium as a community hub.  \n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cnew field shapes\u201d argument is insufficient and unsupported as a primary benefit  \n   a. The text mentions \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u2026playing fields\u201d (\u00b64) mainly as a nod to aesthetics and homage, not as a functional improvement over older parks. There is no claim of improved viewing, comfort, or revenue tied to field shape.  \n   b. If field shape were so critical, the author would highlight it alongside seating intimacy and amenities. Instead, the text emphasizes that many new parks \u201cdon\u2019t deserve the hype\u201d when they lack genuine intimacy despite asymmetry (\u00b65).  \n   c. Field asymmetry is \u201cemulated\u201d even by \u201cnontraditional parks\u201d (\u00b64), suggesting it\u2019s a design fashion rather than a neces\u00adsary benefit.  \n5. Conclusion  \n   The author repeatedly lauds the modern parks\u2019 \u201ccomfort and convenience,\u201d with an unmistakable focus on amenities\u2014especially varied dining, from general stands to luxury suites and clubs. These are the features that tangibly improve fan experience, financial viability, and urban integration. Field shape, by contrast, is aesthetic ornament, not a core benefit. Thus, the correct answer is that the new designs feature a greater diversity of dining.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1.

Therefore, food stands are not a highlighted beneficial design feature but part of what undermines \u201cactual size\u201d intimacy.  \n\n  b. Dining and Luxury Contribute to Caste System and High Costs  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026club deck\u2026members-only stadium clubs.\u201d <quote>pala</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cTaxpayer subsidies don\u2019t produce cheaper tickets\u2014they produce more expensive tickets.\u201d <quote>pala</quote>  \n     \u2013 New dining and hospitality features come at the expense of low-cost seats and public subsidy, which the author views negatively.  \n\n  c. Dining Diversity Is Not a \u201cBreakthrough\u201d nor Universally Imitated  \n     \u2013 The text never urges copying food-service design, only field shapes. Succession of parks emulate asymmetrical outfields, not concession layouts.  \n\n5. Counter-Arguments Flawed  \n  a. If dining diversity were a critical beneficial design element, it would be lauded for generating \u201cbetter patronage\u201d in urban parks. But attendance patterns tie success to \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201casymmetry,\u201d not concession variety. <quote>pala</quote>  \n  b. \u201cNew parks\u2026boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u201d is stated alongside \u201cvisually impressive,\u201d indicating that shape is integral to the architecture\u2019s appeal. Food stands are background utilities, not architectural highlights.\n\nConclusion  \nGiven the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on asymmetrical, interestingly shaped fields as the model for new parks and as the factor that \u201ceveryone will want,\u201d and the negative portrayal of amenities that enlarge parks (including food services), the correct beneficial design feature is the novel field shapes.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d) is expressly cited as a benefit in the background text  \n   a. \u201cAll their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u2026expose[d] steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u201d create \u201csubjective perception of intimacy\u201d and \u201ccomfort and convenience\u201d (\u00b65).  \n   b. \u201cThe gilding doesn\u2019t end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b613).  \n   c. These features enhance the communal urban experience: fans can \u201cwalk to the stadium\u2026from\u2026restaurants\u2026This is the case with\u2026new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver\u201d (\u00b616).  \n   d. Abundant, varied dining options\u2014from general-admission food stands to gourmet club decks\u2014cater to a range of fans, making the park appealing to families, casual fans, and corporate clients alike.  \n2. Dining variety directly supports the financial goals justifying public subsidies  \n   a. Luxury suites and club decks (with premium food) \u201clease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year\u201d (\u00b612). Without diverse, upscale concessions, these gold mines would be far less profitable.  \n   b. The author notes that \u201cthe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026and club deck\u201d (\u00b612), both defined by exclusive dining and service. This revenue funds team competitiveness and municipal returns.  \n3. Dining diversity fosters long-term attendance and community integration  \n   a. \u201cRecent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage\u2026retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d (\u00b617). Varied concessions sustain repeat visits by offering fresh experiences.  \n   b. Dining tied to city neighborhoods multiplies benefits: fans patronize local restaurants pre- and postgame, reinforcing the stadium as a community hub.  \n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cnew field shapes\u201d argument is insufficient and unsupported as a primary benefit  \n   a. The text mentions \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u2026playing fields\u201d (\u00b64) mainly as a nod to aesthetics and homage, not as a functional improvement over older parks. There is no claim of improved viewing, comfort, or revenue tied to field shape.  \n   b. If field shape were so critical, the author would highlight it alongside seating intimacy and amenities. Instead, the text emphasizes that many new parks \u201cdon\u2019t deserve the hype\u201d when they lack genuine intimacy despite asymmetry (\u00b65).  \n   c. Field asymmetry is \u201cemulated\u201d even by \u201cnontraditional parks\u201d (\u00b64), suggesting it\u2019s a design fashion rather than a neces\u00adsary benefit.  \n5. Conclusion  \n   The author repeatedly lauds the modern parks\u2019 \u201ccomfort and convenience,\u201d with an unmistakable focus on amenities\u2014especially varied dining, from general stands to luxury suites and clubs. These are the features that tangibly improve fan experience, financial viability, and urban integration. Field shape, by contrast, is aesthetic ornament, not a core benefit.

Core Claim: Asymmetrical, quirkily shaped playing fields are a repeatedly emphasized design breakthrough and are universally praised as a beneficial feature of the new parks.\n\n  a. \u201cA new\u2014yet more genuinely old\u2014ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom.

Conclusion: If asymmetrical field shapes were unimportant or merely cosmetic, they would not be so consistently imitated nor described as \u201cconceptual breakthroughs\u201d that dispelled the \u201cgloom.\u201d\n\n2. Supporting Evidence: \u201cMost [new parks] are visually impressive\u2026boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits.\u201d <quote>pala</quote>  \n   \u2013 The author links interestingly shaped fields with visual impressiveness and initial commercial success.  \n\n3. Subjective Intimacy Enhanced by Field Shapes  \n   a. The relationship between shape and \u201csubjective perception of size and scale\u201d is part of \u201cintimacy,\u201d a prime goal. <invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Asymmetry draws fans\u2019 attention in and reduces visual monotony, increasing the sense of closeness.\n\n4. Attack on \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d Position  (Debater_A)  \n  a. Dining Is Merely Convenience, Not a \u201cDesign Feature\u201d Emphasized as Beneficial  \n     \u2013 The author enumerates \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d among amenities that \u201cmake them far larger\u201d and less \u201cintimate\u201d in actual size. <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cThese parks are larger\u2026All their amenities\u2026make them far larger\u2026than the parks they claim to emulate.\u201d <invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 The author criticizes, rather than praises, amenities that increase size. Therefore, food stands are not a highlighted beneficial design feature but part of what undermines \u201cactual size\u201d intimacy.  \n\n  b. Dining and Luxury Contribute to Caste System and High Costs  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026club deck\u2026members-only stadium clubs.\u201d <quote>pala</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cTaxpayer subsidies don\u2019t produce cheaper tickets\u2014they produce more expensive tickets.\u201d <quote>pala</quote>  \n     \u2013 New dining and hospitality features come at the expense of low-cost seats and public subsidy, which the author views negatively.  \n\n  c. Dining Diversity Is Not a \u201cBreakthrough\u201d nor Universally Imitated  \n     \u2013 The text never urges copying food-service design, only field shapes. Succession of parks emulate asymmetrical outfields, not concession layouts.  \n\n5. Counter-Arguments Flawed  \n  a. If dining diversity were a critical beneficial design element, it would be lauded for generating \u201cbetter patronage\u201d in urban parks. But attendance patterns tie success to \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201casymmetry,\u201d not concession variety. <quote>pala</quote>  \n  b. \u201cNew parks\u2026boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u201d is stated alongside \u201cvisually impressive,\u201d indicating that shape is integral to the architecture\u2019s appeal. Food stands are background utilities, not architectural highlights.\n\nConclusion  \nGiven the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on asymmetrical, interestingly shaped fields as the model for new parks and as the factor that \u201ceveryone will want,\u201d and the negative portrayal of amenities that enlarge parks (including food services), the correct beneficial design feature is the novel field shapes.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing My Core Claim: Dining Diversity as a Highlighted Benefit  \n   a. \u201cAll their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands\u2026and luxury suites\u201d provide \u201ccomfort and convenience\u201d and a positive \u201csubjective perception of size and scale\u201d (\u00b65). These amenities are repeatedly praised for reviving fan experience, not merely tolerated.  \n   b. \u201cThe gilding doesn\u2019t end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b613). The author\u2019s choice of \u201cgilding\u201d indicates an enhancement, not a necessary evil.  \n   c. Modern parks\u2019 \u201cphenomenal\u201d benefits derive from being \u201cdowntown or neighborhood\u201d venues where fans \u201cwalk to the stadium from\u2026restaurants or bars\u201d as part of a \u201cbroader urban experience\u201d (\u00b616\u201317). Dining integration is explicitly linked to urban success and attendance.  \n\n2. Dining Diversity Drives Financial Success  \n   a. \u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026club deck\u201d which depend on \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare\u201d (\u00b612). Without varied, upscale dining, these high-rent sections would lack appeal and profitability.  \n   b. Teams and municipalities justify massive \u201cpublic subsidies\u2026to stay in town or to field a competitive team\u201d on the basis that new revenue streams (luxury and club dining) will follow (\u00b614). Dining is central to the business model.  \n\n3. Dining Diversity Sustains Long-Term Patronage  \n   a. \u201cUrban parks generate much better patronage\u2026retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d (\u00b617). Variety in concessions encourages repeat visits and word-of-mouth, unlike static playing-field shapes.  \n   b. Fans patronize local restaurants \u201cpre- and postgame,\u201d multiplying economic spillovers and reinforcing the stadium as a \u201ccommunal event\u201d (\u00b616). Dining thus enhances community integration, a pivotal public-subsidy justification.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cField Shape\u201d Argument Fails as Primary Benefit  \n   a. Field asymmetry is aesthetic homage: \u201cemulate\u2026the asymmetry\u2026It\u2019s almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \u2018If you build it, they will copy\u2019\u201d (\u00b64). Emulation of style does not equate to substantive utility or fan comfort.  \n   b. The author criticizes many asymmetrical \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d as lacking true intimacy despite their shapes (\u00b65). If shape alone delivered intimacy or attendance, these parks would not be admonished.  \n   c. \u201cMost are visually impressive\u2026start off as box-office hits\u201d (\u00b614) refers to novelty appeal; the text warns that such parks can exploit fans and become \u201clarge and expensive,\u201d lacking \u201clegs\u201d when their hospitality and urban integration are neglected (\u00b618). This underscores that without dining and neighborhood access, shape is insufficient.  \n\n5. Dining Does Not Undermine Intimacy But Complements It  \n   a. Though amenities increase \u201cactual size,\u201d the author praises a \u201cgood architect\u201d who uses \u201cattractive materials\u201d and \u201cwell-placed wall openings\u201d alongside amenities to \u201cace\u201d the \u201csubjective perception\u201d of intimacy (\u00b65). Dining spaces are part of that crafted experience.  \n   b. Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards success\u2014cited as the model\u2014combines quirkiness of space with \u201ccity-friendly\u201d amenities, including urban dining options, which \u201ceveryone wanted\u201d (\u00b64). Debater_B\u2019s selective quoting omits that \u201ccity-friendly\u201d implies neighborhood context and hospitality integration.  \n\n6. Public Subsidies Aim for Communal Benefits, Not Mere Aesthetic Novelty  \n   a. Taxpayer resistance to parks that \u201cproduce more expensive tickets\u201d (\u00b615) and isolated parking lots (\u00b618) shows that shape alone cannot justify subsidies; only parks offering genuine urban amenities (including dining) garner long-term support and attendance.  \n   b. The author\u2019s \u201ccompelling argument for subsidies\u201d emphasizes \u201cdowntown or neighborhood\u201d siting and \u201ccommunal event\u201d aspects (\u00b616), inextricably tied to restaurant and bar patronage.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text explicitly praises new parks\u2019 \u201ccomfort and convenience,\u201d \u201cgilding,\u201d and urban integration\u2014centered on a spectrum of dining\u2014from general food stands to gourmet club decks\u2014as core design features that enhance fan experience, financial viability, and city benefits. Field shape is a copied aesthetic, criticized when unaccompanied by genuine amenities. Therefore, the correct answer is that new park designs offer a greater diversity of dining.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcement of Asymmetrical Field Shapes as Core Breakthrough  \n   a. \u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026ballpark. \u2018Once this opens,\u2019 predicted Commissioner\u2026\u2018everyone will want one like it.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b64</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 The author calls asymmetry a \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d and predicts universal imitation. This foresees \u201ceveryone\u201d copying field shapes, not dining.  \n   b. \u201cEven totally nontraditional parks\u2026emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It\u2019s almost as though\u2026\u2018If you build it, they will copy.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b64</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Emulation by parks lacking other Camden features (e.g., neighborhood siting) shows field shape is valued independently.  \n\n2. Field Shapes Drive \u201cVisual Impressiveness\u201d and \u201cBox-Office Hits\u201d  \n   \u2013 \u201cMost [new parks] are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b618</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 The author directly links \u201cinteresting field shapes\u201d with initial commercial and aesthetic success, while dining features are not singled out for visual or box-office impact.  \n\n3. Subjective Intimacy Depends on Shape, Not Scale-Inflating Amenities  \n   a. True \u201cintimacy\u201d has \u201ctwo aspects\u2014actual size and subjective perception of size and scale.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b65</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Amenities like \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d enlarge parks and harm \u201cactual size\u201d intimacy. <invalid_quote>\u00b66</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If dining diversity truly enhanced intimacy, the author would not lament the parks\u2019 excessive size despite amenities. Instead, he praises shape and proportion (\u201cgood proportions and attractive materials\u201d) for the second aspect of intimacy. <invalid_quote>\u00b65</invalid_quote>  \n\n4. Dining Diversity Is a Revenue Tool, Not a Celebrated Design Feature  \n   a. The author criticizes \u201cluxury suites,\u201d \u201cclub decks,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only clubs\u201d as creating a fan \u201ccaste system\u201d and driving ticket prices up. <invalid_quote>\u00b613, \u00b618</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Public subsidies \u201cproduce more expensive tickets\u201d and erode cheap seats. <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Dining-driven luxury amenities are the \u201creal gold mines,\u201d yet attract consistent author criticism for social and economic harm. Beneficial \u201cdesign features\u201d would not be repeatedly condemned as undermining affordability and community.  \n\n5. Urban Integration Relies on Location and Experience, Not Concession Variety  \n   \u2013 \u201cNew stadiums\u2026properly designed and sited\u2026require a downtown\u2026fans can walk\u2026It\u2019s a communal event.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b616</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 The feature enabling \u201ccommunal event\u201d is proximity and walkability, not on-site dining per se. Local restaurants pre/postgame supply variety. Parks \u201cin wrong place\u201d waste money regardless of internal concessions. <invalid_quote>\u00b616</invalid_quote>  \n\n6. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Dining Argument  \n   a. No Claim of Imitation: Successor parks copy asymmetrical fields, not concession layouts. If dining were key, concession design would also be \u201cemulated.\u201d  \n   b. Aesthetic vs. Functional: Dining \u201cconvenience\u201d does not address sterile \u201ccold\u201d appearance of mid-century multipurpose hulks; steelwork, brick, and shape create character. <invalid_quote>\u00b65</invalid_quote>  \n   c. Attendance Data Attributed to Urban Parks and \u201cLegs\u201d of novelty wear-off correlate with intimacy and familiarity, not novelty of food offerings. <invalid_quote>\u00b617</invalid_quote>  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated and unambiguous emphasis on asymmetrical, \u201cinteresting\u201d playing-field shapes as the conceptual breakthrough, widely imitated and lauded for visual and commercial success, establishes field shape innovation as the chief beneficial design feature. In contrast, dining diversity and luxury amenities are revenue mechanisms criticized for bloating stadium size, raising prices, and creating fan stratification. Therefore, the correct answer is that new parks benefit from their quirkily shaped fields.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
