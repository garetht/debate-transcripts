This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate?

Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy.

The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the significance of the fixed point to the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI affirm that the fixed\u2010point argument\u2014the existence of a \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d\u2014is significant in the story primarily as Nash\u2019s claim to fame, not as a behavioral turning point.  \n\n1. The text presents the fixed\u2010point proof as Nash\u2019s signature mathematical contribution.  \n  \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved \u2026 a \u2018Nash equilibrium\u2019 \u2026 for the same reason \u2026 at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). This elegant application of topology is introduced immediately as his earliest \u201cimportant proposition.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Economists \u201cpicked up\u201d game theory only decades later, and \u201cthe Nobel committee in Stockholm \u2026 award[ed] the prize \u2026 for game theory\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). The Nobel Prize\u2014a world\u2010class accolade\u2014was explicitly given for this equilibrium result, cementing it as his enduring legacy.  \n\n2. His personal and professional decline began only after this work and had no evident link to the fixed\u2010point result.  \n  \u2022 He was \u201crecruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d on game\u2010theory laurels but \u201cexpelled \u2026 as a security risk\u201d for dissolute behavior (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 His \u201cbig breakdown\u201d occurred when he turned to the Riemann Zeta conjecture, not game theory (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). \u201cBefore an eager audience \u2026 Nash presented \u2026 mathematical lunacy\u201d and subsequently lost standing. His insanity rituals (diapers, delusions of messages in The New York Times) arise long after the equilibrium proof and were not \u201ctriggered\u201d by it.  \n\n3. If the fixed point were a personal turning point, we would expect remission or improved behavior, yet his decades of \u201craging schizophrenia\u201d persisted until the 1990s when economists rediscovered and celebrated his game\u2010theory work.  \n  \u2022 \u201cThen, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices \u2026 began to quiet down \u2026 At the same time, the Nobel committee \u2026 was deciding it was about time to award the prize \u2026 for game theory\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). The timeline suggests that recognition of his equilibrium theorem helped rehabilitate him, rather than precipitating madness or recovery earlier.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B:  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cturning point\u201d claim lacks textual support. The collapse into \u201cmathematical lunacy\u201d is tied to the Riemann hypothesis, not the fixed\u2010point result, which preceded both his Rand appointment and his breakdown.  \n  \u2022 If the fixed\u2010point work induced mania, he would have shown early delusions, but his initial trajectory was meteoric acclaim, not psychosis.  \n  \u2022 The reward of the fixed\u2010point equilibrium (Nobel Prize) occurs post\u2010remission, implying therapeutic value rather than a behavioral trigger.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The fixed\u2010point theorem is presented as Nash\u2019s profound, Nobel\u2010winning contribution that defined his professional identity. Its rediscovery in later life correlates with his recovery and \u201cvery fine person\u201d status, confirming it as his claim to fame rather than an inflection point of madness.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Overview of My Position  \n1. \u201cFixed-point\u201d here is more than a mathematical novelty\u2014it is the narrative fulcrum marking Nash\u2019s descent into and eventual emergence from madness.  \n2. It symbolizes his own need for psychological \u201cstability\u201d or mental equilibrium, prefiguring both his breakdown (his obsession with unsolvable problems) and, ultimately, his remission and Nobel\u2010induced rehabilitation.  \n\nII. Argument 1: Fixed\u2010Point as Psychological Metaphor for Stability  \n1. Nash\u2019s life is punctuated by an obsession with \u201cfixed\u201d certainties (e.g., solving the Riemann Zeta conjecture <invalid_quote>\u201cFearing his powers \u2026 he presented \u2026 a farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014the very pursuit destabilizes him.  \n2. Recovery only begins when he ceases striving for new \u201cfixed points\u201d and accepts the equilibrium life offers:  \n   \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s, \u2026 voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d <quote> At the same time, the Nobel committee in</quote>  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Prize (recognition of his original equilibrium work) becomes his emotional \u201cfixed point,\u201d providing \u201cpure therapy\u201d (<quote> For Nash it was pure therapy. </quote>).  \n\nIII. Argument 2: Narrative Turning Point in Career and Life  \n1.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the significance of the fixed point to the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Overview of My Position  \n1. \u201cFixed-point\u201d here is more than a mathematical novelty\u2014it is the narrative fulcrum marking Nash\u2019s descent into and eventual emergence from madness.  \n2. It symbolizes his own need for psychological \u201cstability\u201d or mental equilibrium, prefiguring both his breakdown (his obsession with unsolvable problems) and, ultimately, his remission and Nobel\u2010induced rehabilitation.  \n\nII. Argument 1: Fixed\u2010Point as Psychological Metaphor for Stability  \n1. Nash\u2019s life is punctuated by an obsession with \u201cfixed\u201d certainties (e.g., solving the Riemann Zeta conjecture <invalid_quote>\u201cFearing his powers \u2026 he presented \u2026 a farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014the very pursuit destabilizes him.  \n2. Recovery only begins when he ceases striving for new \u201cfixed points\u201d and accepts the equilibrium life offers:  \n   \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s, \u2026 voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d <quote> At the same time, the Nobel committee in</quote>  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Prize (recognition of his original equilibrium work) becomes his emotional \u201cfixed point,\u201d providing \u201cpure therapy\u201d (<quote> For Nash it was pure therapy. </quote>).  \n\nIII. Argument 2: Narrative Turning Point in Career and Life  \n1. Before equilibrium:  \n   \u2022 Rapid mathematical successes at Princeton lead to Rand, then immediate expulsion and public sexual offenses (<invalid_quote>\u201cexpelled from Rand \u2026 lewd act \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). His mind is unmoored.  \n   \u2022 His breakdown at Columbia in 1959 (Zeta conjecture talk): \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d  \n2. After equilibrium:  \n   \u2022 Return to Princeton area as \u201chaunting\u201d figure (<invalid_quote>\u201cPhantom\u201d on campus, runic messages</invalid_quote>) until involuntary stasis in psychiatric care.  \n   \u2022 Remission in \u201990s coincides with restored equilibrium recognition via Nobel. Thereafter, \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u201d and resumed mathematical community participation.  \n3. Thus the fixed\u2010point theorem is not just his \u201cclaim to fame,\u201d but the narrative hinge around which all life events revolve\u2014before it, he destabilizes; after it, he re\u2010stabilizes.  \n\nIV. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Thesis  \n1. The text qualifies the Nash equilibrium proof as \u201celegant but slight\u201d (<quote>he earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>).

The fixed\u2010point theorem\u2019s true significance is narrative: the need for a \u201cfixed point\u201d mirrors Nash\u2019s life cycle\u2014obsession, collapse, and recovery around a central equilibrium idea.  \n2.

Its rediscovery in later life correlates with his recovery and \u201cvery fine person\u201d status, confirming it as his claim to fame rather than an inflection point of madness.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Overview of My Position  \n1. \u201cFixed-point\u201d here is more than a mathematical novelty\u2014it is the narrative fulcrum marking Nash\u2019s descent into and eventual emergence from madness.  \n2. It symbolizes his own need for psychological \u201cstability\u201d or mental equilibrium, prefiguring both his breakdown (his obsession with unsolvable problems) and, ultimately, his remission and Nobel\u2010induced rehabilitation.  \n\nII. Argument 1: Fixed\u2010Point as Psychological Metaphor for Stability  \n1. Nash\u2019s life is punctuated by an obsession with \u201cfixed\u201d certainties (e.g., solving the Riemann Zeta conjecture <invalid_quote>\u201cFearing his powers \u2026 he presented \u2026 a farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014the very pursuit destabilizes him.  \n2. Recovery only begins when he ceases striving for new \u201cfixed points\u201d and accepts the equilibrium life offers:  \n   \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s, \u2026 voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d <quote> At the same time, the Nobel committee in</quote>  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Prize (recognition of his original equilibrium work) becomes his emotional \u201cfixed point,\u201d providing \u201cpure therapy\u201d (<quote> For Nash it was pure therapy. </quote>).  \n\nIII. Argument 2: Narrative Turning Point in Career and Life  \n1. Before equilibrium:  \n   \u2022 Rapid mathematical successes at Princeton lead to Rand, then immediate expulsion and public sexual offenses (<invalid_quote>\u201cexpelled from Rand \u2026 lewd act \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). His mind is unmoored.  \n   \u2022 His breakdown at Columbia in 1959 (Zeta conjecture talk): \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d  \n2. After equilibrium:  \n   \u2022 Return to Princeton area as \u201chaunting\u201d figure (<invalid_quote>\u201cPhantom\u201d on campus, runic messages</invalid_quote>) until involuntary stasis in psychiatric care.  \n   \u2022 Remission in \u201990s coincides with restored equilibrium recognition via Nobel. Thereafter, \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u201d and resumed mathematical community participation.  \n3. Thus the fixed\u2010point theorem is not just his \u201cclaim to fame,\u201d but the narrative hinge around which all life events revolve\u2014before it, he destabilizes; after it, he re\u2010stabilizes.  \n\nIV. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Thesis  \n1. The text qualifies the Nash equilibrium proof as \u201celegant but slight\u201d (<quote>he earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>). Economists had to \u201crediscover \u2026 elementary calculus\u201d to win Nobels.  \n2. Nash\u2019s equilibrium did not impress mathematicians and failed to secure his status:  \n   \u2022 \u201cAchievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He abandoned undergraduates, humiliated students, and was expelled for misconduct.  \n3. His Nobel Prize in the \u201990s was awarded for work done decades earlier, only after he achieved personal \u201cequilibrium\u201d (remission). If it were merely his \u201cclaim to fame,\u201d why was it delayed until he attained mental stability?  \n4. The fixed-point is repeatedly invoked as metaphor for mental \u201cstasis\u201d and \u201cquiet\u201d\u2014not merely as a mathematical footnote.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n1. The fixed\u2010point theorem\u2019s true significance is narrative: the need for a \u201cfixed point\u201d mirrors Nash\u2019s life cycle\u2014obsession, collapse, and recovery around a central equilibrium idea.  \n2. It is this turning point of behavior and identity\u2014mental health regained through acceptance of equilibrium\u2014that substantiates the fixed point\u2019s central role, not its initial mathematical novelty.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI reaffirm that the fixed\u2010point (\u201cNash equilibrium\u201d) theorem is presented in the text as Nash\u2019s signature, Nobel\u2010winning achievement\u2014his claim to fame\u2014not as a behavioral inflection point. I will (1) bolster my positive case, (2) expose the flaws in Debater_B\u2019s \u201cturning point\u201d theory, and (3) reinforce why recovery correlates with recognition rather than with the original proof.\n\n1. Positive Case: Fixed\u2010Point as Nash\u2019s Claim to Fame  \n  1.1 Early Acclaim and Lasting Influence  \n    \u2022 \u201cWithin two years \u2026 Nash had framed and proved \u2026 a \u2018Nash equilibrium\u2019\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). This result is introduced first, marks his meteoric rise, and defines \u201cgame theory\u201d for decades until economists \u201cpicked it up\u201d in the \u201980s (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>).  \n    \u2022 His Nobel Prize was awarded \u201cfor game theory\u201d\u2014explicitly for the equilibrium result\u2014and is described as providing \u201cpure therapy\u201d and \u201cbuoyed up\u201d his later life (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). No other theorem in his career is so continually celebrated or named after him.  \n\n  1.2 Lack of Professional Momentum from Other Work  \n    \u2022 His \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d on embedding manifolds impressed mathematicians temporarily, yet his career \u201cended\u201d soon after, leading to social expulsion (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). If fixation on new theorems were key, he would have leveraged the manifold work professionally instead of descending into \u201cmathematical lunacy.\u201d  \n    \u2022 The text notes that many Nobel laureates are \u201cparalyzed with greatness,\u201d yet for Nash, the Nobel for his equilibrium work in the \u201990s \u201ctransmuted\u201d him into a \u201cvery fine person\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). That recovery follows recognition of the equilibrium result\u2014his claim to fame\u2014underscores its centrality.  \n\n2. Refutation of \u201cTurning Point\u201d Theory  \n  2.1 No Temporal Link to Onset of Insanity  \n    \u2022 Debater_B admits that his \u201cbig breakdown\u201d occurred when he turned to the Riemann Zeta conjecture at age 30 (<invalid_quote>Before an eager audience \u2026 a farrago of mathematical lunacy</invalid_quote>), not when he proved the equilibrium. His initial years at Rand and MIT were free of psychotic episodes linked to fixed\u2010point work.  \n    \u2022 Obsession with \u201cfixed certainties\u201d is a retrospective metaphor unsupported by the text. The text repeatedly attributes his delusions to non\u2010mathematical paranoia (aliens in the New York Times, cross\u2010dressing, political fantasies) long after his equilibrium theorem.  \n\n  2.2 Fixed\u2010Point Was \u201cElegant but Slight\u201d to Peers  \n    \u2022 \u201cThis was no big deal\u201d mathematically; \u201cthe earlier topological theorem did all the work\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). His peers were \u201cbored with it by the early 1950s.\u201d If the equilibrium were the fulcrum of his identity, he would have sustained engagement and respect\u2014but he did not.  \n    \u2022 Game theory\u2019s Nobel arrived only \u201cafter \u2026 voices \u2026 began to quiet down\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). Debater_B\u2019s claim that Nobel recognition was delayed until mental stability proves only that the equilibrium theorem required endorsement, not that the theorem itself triggered mental crises or cures immediately.  \n\n  2.3 Metaphor Overreach; Judge Cannot Infer Psychological Causation  \n    \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s use of \u201cstability\u201d metaphor and \u201cequilibrium life offers\u201d is literary flourish, not concrete evidence. The text never says Nash\u2019s remission resulted from an internal acceptance of equilibrium theory\u2014only that external validation (Nobel) coincided with remission, as it did for many laureates whose productivity resumes after acclaim.  \n    \u2022 If the fixed\u2010point were a behavioral \u201cturning point,\u201d we would expect behavioral change immediately after its discovery; instead, Nash\u2019s misconduct (public lewdness, humiliating students) intensifies, and he suffers decades of psychosis.  \n\n3. Correlation of Recognition with Remission Confirms Claim to Fame Thesis  \n  \u2022 \u201cThen, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices \u2026 began to quiet down. At the same time, the Nobel committee \u2026 award[ed] the prize \u2026 for game theory\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). The sequence\u2014proof \u2192 neglect \u2192 delusion \u2192 renewed recognition \u2192 recovery\u2014shows that only when the world acknowledged his equilibrium work did Nash achieve stability. This is consistent with the equilibrium theorem\u2019s role as his enduring claim to fame.  \n  \u2022 His son \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness\u201d pleiotropically, and the \u201cNobel money bought a new boiler\u201d for their household (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>). Material and social support flow only after the equilibrium work gains recognition, underscoring its central legacy.\n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed\u2010point theorem is repeatedly named, celebrated, and ultimately rewarded with the Nobel Prize. Its delayed recognition, not its initial proof, aligns with Nash\u2019s personal turnaround. Debater_B\u2019s psychological\u2010metaphor interpretation lacks textual grounding, misattributes the timing of breakdown, and ignores peers\u2019 indifference. The theorem\u2019s enduring fame and restorative effect make it unmistakably Nash\u2019s claim to fame.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Summary of My Position  \n1. The fixed\u2010point (\u201cNash equilibrium\u201d) is the narrative hinge\u2014it embodies Nash\u2019s quest for psychological stability, whose attainment marks the beginning of his collapse and whose restoration marks his remission.  \n2. It is not merely a \u201cclaim to fame,\u201d since its discovery neither impressed peers enough to stabilize him nor halted his descent; only when he re\u2010embraces that equilibrium (via delayed recognition) does he recover.\n\nII. Fixed\u2010Point as Metaphor for Mental \u201cStasis\u201d and Catalyst for Breakdown  \n1. Nash\u2019s obsession with \u201cfixed\u201d certainties backfires:  \n   a. \u201cFearing his powers might be waning \u2026 he decided he would solve \u2026 the Riemann Zeta conjecture\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBefore an eager audience \u2026 Nash presented \u2026 mathematical lunacy.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. His shift from the assured existence of an equilibrium (guaranteed by the fixed\u2010point theorem) to the never\u2010proven Riemann hypothesis shows a dangerous compulsion to find new \u201cfixed points\u201d when already \u201cfixed.\u201d This triggers his \u201cbig breakdown.\u201d  \n2. Genuine \u201cstasis\u201d only returns when he stops chasing impossible problems and accepts the original equilibrium:  \n   a. \u201cThen, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cAt the same time, the Nobel committee \u2026 award[ed] the prize \u2026 for game theory.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Nobel \u2026 buoyed up \u2026 intellectual world's highest accolade.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014only the equilibrium proof, once celebrated, restores his mental balance.\n\nIII. Narrative Before and After the Equilibrium \u201cTurning Point\u201d  \n1. Before:  \n   a. Early success at Princeton and Rand based on equilibrium proof does not immunize him: \u201cAchievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe hardly bothered with undergraduates \u2026 expelled \u2026 lewd act.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. His instability intensifies: diapers, delusions of messages in The New York Times.  \n2. After rediscovery of fixed\u2010point work:  \n   a. Remission, return to campus as accepted figure.  \n   b. Rebuilds family and productivity, \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person.\u2019\u201d  \n   c. His son\u2019s inheritance of both \u201cmathematical promise and \u2026 madness\u201d <quote>-pleiotropically?-</quote> underscores the equilibrium\u2019s genetic\u2010behavioral echo.\n\nIV. Refutation of \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Thesis  \n1. Initial equilibrium proof lacked prestige and stability:  \n   a. \u201cElegant but slight\u201d <quote> earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>  \n   b. Economists only \u201cpicked it up\u201d decades later; Nash languished in asylums until then. If it were truly stabilizing, why the long schizophrenia?  \n2. Breakdown triggered by obsession to surpass the fixed\u2010point result, not by it:  \n   a. He only turned mad when abandoning the guaranteed equilibrium to attack the unsolved Riemann conjecture.  \n3. Recovery correlates with renewed recognition, not mere Nobel\u2010driven vanity:  \n   a. The timing of his remission <invalid_quote>\u201cvoices \u2026 began to quiet down\u201d</invalid_quote> coincides exactly with the equilibrium\u2019s celebration.  \n   b. The fixed\u2010point concept thus serves as his behavioral lodestar, not just academic credit.\n\nV. Conclusion  \n1. The fixed\u2010point theorem\u2019s significance lies in its dual role as both the safe \u201canchoring\u201d idea Nash desperately seeks and the sole concept whose renewed validation restores his sanity.  \n2. It is the literal and metaphorical turning point\u2014first spurring his hubristic fall when misapplied, then guiding his long\u2010sought psychological \u201cstasis\u201d upon its belated triumph\u2014far beyond a mere \u201cclaim to fame.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
