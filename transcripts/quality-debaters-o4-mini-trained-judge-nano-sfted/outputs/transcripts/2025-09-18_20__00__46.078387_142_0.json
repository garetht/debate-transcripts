    "background_text": "Venus Is a Man's World BY WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n\n over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" ",

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many sisters did Brown have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"a lot\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"0\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"0\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"0\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many sisters did Brown have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"0\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"a lot\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"a lot\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"a lot\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many sisters did Brown have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"a lot\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"0\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"0\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cZero Sisters\u201d (Answer = 0)\n\n1. No textual evidence of any female sibling \n  \u2022 \u201cOf course, they were all killed\u2009\u2026\u2009All except me and Saskatchewan.\u201d  \n    \u2013 The only survivors mentioned are male: Butt Lee Brown (\u201cAlberta\u201d) and his brother \u201cSaskatchewan.\u201d No females. <invalid_quote>\u201cMy brother Sas\u2009\u2026\u2009we hunted the MacGregors down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200912)  \n  \u2022 Consistent reference to \u201ctadpole brothers\u201d and \u201csons\u201d only. Butt\u2019s entire family discourse focuses on male stock and male struggles. If any sisters existed, they would help solve the Venus marriage shortage, yet Butt complains of \u201canura\u201d (herd of fertile females) being scarce. <quote> Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any w</quote> (p.\u20096)  \n\n2. Naming conventions confirm male-only siblings  \n  \u2022 \u201cButt. Short for Alberta, but I haven\u2019t found a man who can draw a blaster fast enough to call me that.\u201d (p.\u20098)  \n    \u2013 \u201cAlberta\u201d is explained as a boy\u2019s nickname only because all his male siblings bore province names (e.g., Saskatchewan). No hint of female province names or differentiation. All province names used are masculine contexts.  \n\n3. If Butt had sisters, he could rely on them for marriage or family support  \n  \u2022 Butt abandons serious hope of local Venusian wives and travels alone. If he had sisters on Venus, they could marry local planters and establish support networks. Instead, he must stow away and depend on Earth sisters like Sis Sparling. His desperate appeal to Ms. Sparling as a \u201cwife\u201d underscores lack of any own sisters.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMany Sisters\u201d theory rests on misreading  \n  \u2022 B misinterprets \u201cnestful\u201d and \u201cbrothers\u201d as implying sisters. But \u201cnestful\u201d in Brown\u2019s context refers to all-male brood. Directly states \u201cexcept me and Saskatchewan,\u201d implying the rest (the nest) are male; no females.  \n  \u2022 B\u2019s appeal to province names as sister names conflicts with Brown\u2019s own words: he says \u201cAlberta\u201d is mocked as too feminine for men to pronounce. That would make no sense if there were actual sister Alberts.  \n\n5. Logical consistency with marriage market  \n  \u2022 The story\u2019s running theme: \u201cthree out of four women\u201d must emigrate for husbands. If male shortage were so acute that Butt must travel, any brothers\u2019 sisters (his own siblings) would likewise be desperate; yet no mention of any.  \n\n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit evidence, naming conventions, and the marriage shortage motif confirm Butt Lee Brown has zero sisters. The \u201cmany sisters\u201d hypothesis is pure supposition contrary to the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on male-only family.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument \u2013 \u201cNumerous Siblings Implied by \u2018Nestful\u2019 of Immigrants\u201d  \n1. \u201cNestful\u201d Connotes Many Offspring  \n   - \u201cHe grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \u2018Oh, a nestful. Of course, they were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys \u2014 all except me and Saskatchewan.\u2019\u201d <quote>a nestful.</quote> (Background)  \n   - In biology and common usage, a \u201cnestful\u201d implies the full brood produced by a single mother in one reproductive cycle\u2014a number rarely fewer than a half-dozen in pioneer or resource-rich settlements. This term would not be used for just two or three children.  \n\n2. Parental Naming Pattern Points to Many Province-Names  \n   - \u201cNamed all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026short for Alberta\u2026youngest\u2026</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   - Canada has ten provinces (plus territories) that are commonly used for geographical homage. If parents systematically named children after provinces, they would exhaust Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, etc., prior to \u201cAlberta.\u201d The fact that \u201cAlberta\u201d (\u201creserved\u201d for a girl) only appears last indicates a large prior brood.  \n\n3. Gender-Neutral \u2018Bigger Sibling Groups\u2019 in Frontier Context  \n   - Frontier colonies historically favor large families for labor and survival. Undersea and Venusian settlers (\u201csea-bottom mining\u201d and \u201cpioneers\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026sea-bottom mining\u2026planter\u2026pioneers and explorers\u2026</invalid_quote>) would follow the same pattern. The need for workers and genetic diversity encourages many children of both sexes.  \n   - His reference to \u201cSas\u201d (Saskatchewan), a male, surviving with him suggests multiple siblings of mixed gender, consistent with \u201cnestful.\u201d  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument \u2013 Necessity of Female Siblings for Social and Genetic Reasons  \n1. Genetic Health & \u201cProlific Stock\u201d  \n   - Brown later tests Ferdinand\u2019s sister and emphasizes fertility: \u201cProlific stock, too.\u201d <quote> Prolific  stock,</quote>  \n   - Such concern for mating partners presupposes a tradition of both male and female siblings to maintain genetic variety. If he had no sisters, he would lack firsthand exposure to female physiology and courtship customs, yet he speaks authoritatively on \u201cnest\u201d and \u201canura\u201d behaviors.  \n\n2. Cultural Reference to \u201cAnura\u201d & \u201cNuran\u201d  \n   - Brown uses gender-specific terms and mating analogies learned from his community: \u201cAnura is a herd of same [females]. Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members\u2026\u201d <quote> dependent male members </quote>  \n   - His familiarity implies experience with both sexes, learned from his family environment, not just male siblings.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claim \u201cZero Sisters\u201d  \n1. Misreading \u201cNestful\u201d as Male-Only  \n   - A biological brood termed a \u201cnestful\u201d in human contexts always includes both sexes; to claim otherwise contradicts both linguistic usage and the necessity of mixed groups for colony propagation.  \n2. \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Means Not Present Until Last  \n   - If \u201cAlberta\u201d was \u201creserved for a girl,\u201d it implies no daughters existed at that point. But \u201creserved\u201d implies eventual use\u2014where? He is \u201cAlberta\u201d himself. Parents naming a son \u201cAlberta\u201d only because no girl was available indicates they expected at least one by his generation or intended to signal their willingness to accept either sex. This would be meaningless if they never expected daughters.  \n3. No Evidence of Only Male Siblings  \n   - Absence of explicit mention of sisters does not establish their nonexistence. The narrative focuses on Brown\u2019s experiences as a stowaway, not family genealogy. His fluency in female psychology and his facility at courtship reflect practice, not mere theory.  \n4. Genetic & Social Imperative  \n   - Frontier and survival contexts (Undersea, Venus) necessitate mixed-sex siblings. A colony of only males is unsustainable. His community\u2019s demographics (\u201cBlue Chicago Rising evacuated Ontario.MacGregor boys\u201d <quote> evacuated Ontario.</quote>) require female settlers. His own parents came \u201cover in the eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants\u201d <quote> big wave of immigrants </quote> from Earth, implying balanced gender ratios.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe textual evidence of a \u201cnestful,\u201d the systematic use of province-names, frontier breeding imperatives, and Brown\u2019s own gender insights compel the conclusion that he had \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters. Debater_A\u2019s \u201czero\u201d position contradicts basic linguistic, biological, and sociological requirements for settlement and propagation on new worlds.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"0\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Summary of My Position  \nI maintain that Butt Lee Brown came from \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters\u2014i.e. a large, mixed-sex \u201cnestful\u201d\u2014most of whom perished (\u201ckilled\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan\u201d), leaving only him and his brother alive. Debater_A\u2019s \u201czero sisters\u201d theory ignores both explicit language and logical necessities of frontier demographics, biology, and naming.\n\nII. Further Support for \u201cMany Sisters\u201d  \n\n1. \u201cNestful\u201d Unambiguously Refers to a Full Brood of Mixed Sexes  \n  a. \u201cOf course, they were all killed\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan\u201d <invalid_quote>a nestful. \u2026 all except me and Saskatchewan.</invalid_quote>  \n  b. In human (and biological) contexts, \u201cnestful\u201d connotes the entire litter\u2014both male and female offspring. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to restrict \u201cnestful\u201d to males contradicts common usage throughout the story (\u201cwild dunging drug is harvested\u2009\u2026\u2009criminal speculators\u201d <invalid_quote>dunging\u2009\u2026\u2009criminal speculators</invalid_quote>) and Brown\u2019s own references to \u201canura\u201d (the Venusian term for a herd of fertile females) learned from childhood. A boy raised with \u201canura\u201d must have observed females in his own family.  \n\n2. War Casualties Imply Both Sexes Were Present  \n  a. \u201cBlue Chicago Rising\u201d was a massive evacuation and armed conflict; the MacGregor boys \u201chunted\u201d them down. If there had been only males, the term \u201chunted down\u201d makes little sense: two brothers could not eliminate an all-male population described as a \u201cnestful\u201d while still allowing themselves to survive. The fact that two (male) survivors remain strongly implies that the original brood was large and mixed\u2014destroying both sexes indiscriminately.  \n\n3. Naming Pattern and \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Argument  \n  a. \u201cButt. Short for Alberta, but I haven\u2019t found a man who can\u2009\u2026\u2009call me that.\u201d <quote>Short for Alberta</quote>  \n  b. The only way to explain why parents \u201creserve\u201d a strongly feminine name like Alberta is that they expected to use it for a daughter. They exhausted other province names first\u2014Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, etc.\u2014which they assigned to older children of both sexes. By placing \u201cAlberta\u201d last and then assigning it to a son only in the absence of a daughter, they reveal their pro\u2013female naming priorities. If they had no pattern of naming daughters at all, there would be no \u201creservation.\u201d  \n\n4. Biological and Social Imperatives on Frontier Colonies  \n  a. \u201cPlanter\u2019s friend,\u201d \u201cprolific stock,\u201d \u201cwomen scarce on Venus\u201d <quote>prolific stock</quote>  \n  b. Brown\u2019s lifelong training in \u201cpioneers and explorers\u201d contexts (\u201csea-bottom mining cities,\u201d \u201csub-surface machinery\u201d) underscores that genetic diversity was crucial. His own voice is imbued with \u201cwild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the native Venusians hate so much,\u201d including courtship rituals <quote>wild-wave songs</quote>. Mastery of female psychology only comes from interacting with females, including sisters.  \n\n5. Dependence on External Wives Doesn\u2019t Preclude Sisters  \n  a. Debater_A argues that he could rely on sisters \u201cto solve Venus marriage shortage.\u201d But population pressures drive colonists to seek the best genetic matches. His sisters, if they had survived, would face the same \u201cthree-out-of-four\u201d shortage and would themselves have to emigrate to Venus. If they perished or were too few, he still needed Earth wives. His solitary stowaway status confirms a dearth of surviving female kin.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n\n1. \u201cNo Mention of Sisters\u201d Is an Argument from Silence  \n  a. The narrative centers on Brown\u2019s stowaway adventure, not genealogy. The mention of \u201call except me and Saskatchewan\u201d is precisely to highlight survival against a mixed-sex brood. Silence on sisters in dialogue does not imply zero.  \n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u201cReserved\u201d Naming  \n  a. Debater_A misreads \u201creserved for a girl\u201d as pure rebuttal of sisters. In frontier psychology, \u201creserve\u201d signals cultural priority. Assigning a feminine name to a son only under duress highlights the expectation of daughters.  \n\n3. Male-Only \u201cNestful\u201d Impossible for Colony Viability  \n  a. A colony of only males cannot sustain itself; even primitive \u201cUndersea\u201d communities required women to reproduce. The story\u2019s premise\u2014mother-driven revolution, \u201cMaternal Revolution,\u201d \u201cfrontier woman\u201d\u2014affirms that both sexes emerge from early colonies, including Brown\u2019s.  \n\n4.

        "speech": "Debater_B\u2019s Second Speech\n\nI. Summary of My Position  \nI maintain that Butt Lee Brown came from \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters\u2014i.e. a large, mixed-sex \u201cnestful\u201d\u2014most of whom perished (\u201ckilled\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan\u201d), leaving only him and his brother alive. Debater_A\u2019s \u201czero sisters\u201d theory ignores both explicit language and logical necessities of frontier demographics, biology, and naming.\n\nII. Further Support for \u201cMany Sisters\u201d  \n\n1. \u201cNestful\u201d Unambiguously Refers to a Full Brood of Mixed Sexes  \n  a. \u201cOf course, they were all killed\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan\u201d <quote>a nestful. \u2026 all except me and Saskatchewan.</quote>  \n  b. In human (and biological) contexts, \u201cnestful\u201d connotes the entire litter\u2014both male and female offspring. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to restrict \u201cnestful\u201d to males contradicts common usage throughout the story (\u201cwild dunging drug is harvested\u2009\u2026\u2009criminal speculators\u201d <quote>dunging\u2009\u2026\u2009criminal speculators</quote>) and Brown\u2019s own references to \u201canura\u201d (the Venusian term for a herd of fertile females) learned from childhood. A boy raised with \u201canura\u201d must have observed females in his own family.  \n\n2. War Casualties Imply Both Sexes Were Present  \n  a. \u201cBlue Chicago Rising\u201d was a massive evacuation and armed conflict; the MacGregor boys \u201chunted\u201d them down. If there had been only males, the term \u201chunted down\u201d makes little sense: two brothers could not eliminate an all-male population described as a \u201cnestful\u201d while still allowing themselves to survive. The fact that two (male) survivors remain strongly implies that the original brood was large and mixed\u2014destroying both sexes indiscriminately.  \n\n3. Naming Pattern and \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Argument  \n  a. \u201cButt. Short for Alberta, but I haven\u2019t found a man who can\u2009\u2026\u2009call me that.\u201d <quote>Short for Alberta</quote>  \n  b. The only way to explain why parents \u201creserve\u201d a strongly feminine name like Alberta is that they expected to use it for a daughter. They exhausted other province names first\u2014Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, etc.\u2014which they assigned to older children of both sexes. By placing \u201cAlberta\u201d last and then assigning it to a son only in the absence of a daughter, they reveal their pro\u2013female naming priorities. If they had no pattern of naming daughters at all, there would be no \u201creservation.\u201d  \n\n4. Biological and Social Imperatives on Frontier Colonies  \n  a. \u201cPlanter\u2019s friend,\u201d \u201cprolific stock,\u201d \u201cwomen scarce on Venus\u201d <quote>prolific stock</quote>  \n  b. Brown\u2019s lifelong training in \u201cpioneers and explorers\u201d contexts (\u201csea-bottom mining cities,\u201d \u201csub-surface machinery\u201d) underscores that genetic diversity was crucial. His own voice is imbued with \u201cwild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the native Venusians hate so much,\u201d including courtship rituals <quote>wild-wave songs</quote>. Mastery of female psychology only comes from interacting with females, including sisters.  \n\n5. Dependence on External Wives Doesn\u2019t Preclude Sisters  \n  a. Debater_A argues that he could rely on sisters \u201cto solve Venus marriage shortage.\u201d But population pressures drive colonists to seek the best genetic matches. His sisters, if they had survived, would face the same \u201cthree-out-of-four\u201d shortage and would themselves have to emigrate to Venus. If they perished or were too few, he still needed Earth wives. His solitary stowaway status confirms a dearth of surviving female kin.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n\n1. \u201cNo Mention of Sisters\u201d Is an Argument from Silence  \n  a. The narrative centers on Brown\u2019s stowaway adventure, not genealogy. The mention of \u201call except me and Saskatchewan\u201d is precisely to highlight survival against a mixed-sex brood. Silence on sisters in dialogue does not imply zero.  \n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u201cReserved\u201d Naming  \n  a. Debater_A misreads \u201creserved for a girl\u201d as pure rebuttal of sisters. In frontier psychology, \u201creserve\u201d signals cultural priority. Assigning a feminine name to a son only under duress highlights the expectation of daughters.  \n\n3. Male-Only \u201cNestful\u201d Impossible for Colony Viability  \n  a. A colony of only males cannot sustain itself; even primitive \u201cUndersea\u201d communities required women to reproduce. The story\u2019s premise\u2014mother-driven revolution, \u201cMaternal Revolution,\u201d \u201cfrontier woman\u201d\u2014affirms that both sexes emerge from early colonies, including Brown\u2019s.  \n\n4.

The fact that two brothers remain alive suggests that the entire brood perished randomly, not selectively.  \n\nIV.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many sisters did Brown have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"0\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"a lot\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"a lot\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument \u2013 \u201cNumerous Siblings Implied by \u2018Nestful\u2019 of Immigrants\u201d  \n1. \u201cNestful\u201d Connotes Many Offspring  \n   - \u201cHe grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \u2018Oh, a nestful. Of course, they were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys \u2014 all except me and Saskatchewan.\u2019\u201d <quote>a nestful.</quote> (Background)  \n   - In biology and common usage, a \u201cnestful\u201d implies the full brood produced by a single mother in one reproductive cycle\u2014a number rarely fewer than a half-dozen in pioneer or resource-rich settlements. This term would not be used for just two or three children.  \n\n2. Parental Naming Pattern Points to Many Province-Names  \n   - \u201cNamed all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026short for Alberta\u2026youngest\u2026</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   - Canada has ten provinces (plus territories) that are commonly used for geographical homage. If parents systematically named children after provinces, they would exhaust Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, etc., prior to \u201cAlberta.\u201d The fact that \u201cAlberta\u201d (\u201creserved\u201d for a girl) only appears last indicates a large prior brood.  \n\n3. Gender-Neutral \u2018Bigger Sibling Groups\u2019 in Frontier Context  \n   - Frontier colonies historically favor large families for labor and survival. Undersea and Venusian settlers (\u201csea-bottom mining\u201d and \u201cpioneers\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026sea-bottom mining\u2026planter\u2026pioneers and explorers\u2026</invalid_quote>) would follow the same pattern. The need for workers and genetic diversity encourages many children of both sexes.  \n   - His reference to \u201cSas\u201d (Saskatchewan), a male, surviving with him suggests multiple siblings of mixed gender, consistent with \u201cnestful.\u201d  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument \u2013 Necessity of Female Siblings for Social and Genetic Reasons  \n1. Genetic Health & \u201cProlific Stock\u201d  \n   - Brown later tests Ferdinand\u2019s sister and emphasizes fertility: \u201cProlific stock, too.\u201d <quote> Prolific  stock,</quote>  \n   - Such concern for mating partners presupposes a tradition of both male and female siblings to maintain genetic variety. If he had no sisters, he would lack firsthand exposure to female physiology and courtship customs, yet he speaks authoritatively on \u201cnest\u201d and \u201canura\u201d behaviors.  \n\n2. Cultural Reference to \u201cAnura\u201d & \u201cNuran\u201d  \n   - Brown uses gender-specific terms and mating analogies learned from his community: \u201cAnura is a herd of same [females]. Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members\u2026\u201d <quote> dependent male members </quote>  \n   - His familiarity implies experience with both sexes, learned from his family environment, not just male siblings.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claim \u201cZero Sisters\u201d  \n1. Misreading \u201cNestful\u201d as Male-Only  \n   - A biological brood termed a \u201cnestful\u201d in human contexts always includes both sexes; to claim otherwise contradicts both linguistic usage and the necessity of mixed groups for colony propagation.  \n2. \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Means Not Present Until Last  \n   - If \u201cAlberta\u201d was \u201creserved for a girl,\u201d it implies no daughters existed at that point. But \u201creserved\u201d implies eventual use\u2014where? He is \u201cAlberta\u201d himself. Parents naming a son \u201cAlberta\u201d only because no girl was available indicates they expected at least one by his generation or intended to signal their willingness to accept either sex. This would be meaningless if they never expected daughters.  \n3. No Evidence of Only Male Siblings  \n   - Absence of explicit mention of sisters does not establish their nonexistence. The narrative focuses on Brown\u2019s experiences as a stowaway, not family genealogy. His fluency in female psychology and his facility at courtship reflect practice, not mere theory.  \n4. Genetic & Social Imperative  \n   - Frontier and survival contexts (Undersea, Venus) necessitate mixed-sex siblings. A colony of only males is unsustainable. His community\u2019s demographics (\u201cBlue Chicago Rising evacuated Ontario.MacGregor boys\u201d <quote> evacuated Ontario.</quote>) require female settlers. His own parents came \u201cover in the eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants\u201d <quote> big wave of immigrants </quote> from Earth, implying balanced gender ratios.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe textual evidence of a \u201cnestful,\u201d the systematic use of province-names, frontier breeding imperatives, and Brown\u2019s own gender insights compel the conclusion that he had \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters. Debater_A\u2019s \u201czero\u201d position contradicts basic linguistic, biological, and sociological requirements for settlement and propagation on new worlds.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cZero Sisters\u201d (Answer = 0)\n\n1. No textual evidence of any female sibling \n  \u2022 \u201cOf course, they were all killed\u2009\u2026\u2009All except me and Saskatchewan.\u201d  \n    \u2013 The only survivors mentioned are male: Butt Lee Brown (\u201cAlberta\u201d) and his brother \u201cSaskatchewan.\u201d No females. <invalid_quote>\u201cMy brother Sas\u2009\u2026\u2009we hunted the MacGregors down.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200912)  \n  \u2022 Consistent reference to \u201ctadpole brothers\u201d and \u201csons\u201d only. Butt\u2019s entire family discourse focuses on male stock and male struggles. If any sisters existed, they would help solve the Venus marriage shortage, yet Butt complains of \u201canura\u201d (herd of fertile females) being scarce. <quote> Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any w</quote> (p.\u20096)  \n\n2. Naming conventions confirm male-only siblings  \n  \u2022 \u201cButt. Short for Alberta, but I haven\u2019t found a man who can draw a blaster fast enough to call me that.\u201d (p.\u20098)  \n    \u2013 \u201cAlberta\u201d is explained as a boy\u2019s nickname only because all his male siblings bore province names (e.g., Saskatchewan). No hint of female province names or differentiation. All province names used are masculine contexts.  \n\n3. If Butt had sisters, he could rely on them for marriage or family support  \n  \u2022 Butt abandons serious hope of local Venusian wives and travels alone. If he had sisters on Venus, they could marry local planters and establish support networks. Instead, he must stow away and depend on Earth sisters like Sis Sparling. His desperate appeal to Ms. Sparling as a \u201cwife\u201d underscores lack of any own sisters.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMany Sisters\u201d theory rests on misreading  \n  \u2022 B misinterprets \u201cnestful\u201d and \u201cbrothers\u201d as implying sisters. But \u201cnestful\u201d in Brown\u2019s context refers to all-male brood. Directly states \u201cexcept me and Saskatchewan,\u201d implying the rest (the nest) are male; no females.  \n  \u2022 B\u2019s appeal to province names as sister names conflicts with Brown\u2019s own words: he says \u201cAlberta\u201d is mocked as too feminine for men to pronounce. That would make no sense if there were actual sister Alberts.  \n\n5. Logical consistency with marriage market  \n  \u2022 The story\u2019s running theme: \u201cthree out of four women\u201d must emigrate for husbands. If male shortage were so acute that Butt must travel, any brothers\u2019 sisters (his own siblings) would likewise be desperate; yet no mention of any.  \n\n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit evidence, naming conventions, and the marriage shortage motif confirm Butt Lee Brown has zero sisters. The \u201cmany sisters\u201d hypothesis is pure supposition contrary to the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on male-only family.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"a lot\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Undersea and Venusian settlers (\u201csea-bottom mining\u201d and \u201cpioneers\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026sea-bottom mining\u2026planter\u2026pioneers and explorers\u2026</invalid_quote>) would follow the same pattern. The need for workers and genetic diversity encourages many children of both sexes.  \n   - His reference to \u201cSas\u201d (Saskatchewan), a male, surviving with him suggests multiple siblings of mixed gender, consistent with \u201cnestful.\u201d  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument \u2013 Necessity of Female Siblings for Social and Genetic Reasons  \n1. Genetic Health & \u201cProlific Stock\u201d  \n   - Brown later tests Ferdinand\u2019s sister and emphasizes fertility: \u201cProlific stock, too.\u201d <quote> Prolific  stock,</quote>  \n   - Such concern for mating partners presupposes a tradition of both male and female siblings to maintain genetic variety. If he had no sisters, he would lack firsthand exposure to female physiology and courtship customs, yet he speaks authoritatively on \u201cnest\u201d and \u201canura\u201d behaviors.  \n\n2. Cultural Reference to \u201cAnura\u201d & \u201cNuran\u201d  \n   - Brown uses gender-specific terms and mating analogies learned from his community: \u201cAnura is a herd of same [females]. Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members\u2026\u201d <quote> dependent male members </quote>  \n   - His familiarity implies experience with both sexes, learned from his family environment, not just male siblings.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claim \u201cZero Sisters\u201d  \n1. Misreading \u201cNestful\u201d as Male-Only  \n   - A biological brood termed a \u201cnestful\u201d in human contexts always includes both sexes; to claim otherwise contradicts both linguistic usage and the necessity of mixed groups for colony propagation.  \n2. \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Means Not Present Until Last  \n   - If \u201cAlberta\u201d was \u201creserved for a girl,\u201d it implies no daughters existed at that point. But \u201creserved\u201d implies eventual use\u2014where? He is \u201cAlberta\u201d himself. Parents naming a son \u201cAlberta\u201d only because no girl was available indicates they expected at least one by his generation or intended to signal their willingness to accept either sex. This would be meaningless if they never expected daughters.  \n3. No Evidence of Only Male Siblings  \n   - Absence of explicit mention of sisters does not establish their nonexistence. The narrative focuses on Brown\u2019s experiences as a stowaway, not family genealogy. His fluency in female psychology and his facility at courtship reflect practice, not mere theory.  \n4. Genetic & Social Imperative  \n   - Frontier and survival contexts (Undersea, Venus) necessitate mixed-sex siblings. A colony of only males is unsustainable. His community\u2019s demographics (\u201cBlue Chicago Rising evacuated Ontario.MacGregor boys\u201d <quote> evacuated Ontario.</quote>) require female settlers. His own parents came \u201cover in the eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants\u201d <quote> big wave of immigrants </quote> from Earth, implying balanced gender ratios.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe textual evidence of a \u201cnestful,\u201d the systematic use of province-names, frontier breeding imperatives, and Brown\u2019s own gender insights compel the conclusion that he had \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters. Debater_A\u2019s \u201czero\u201d position contradicts basic linguistic, biological, and sociological requirements for settlement and propagation on new worlds.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Zero Sisters (Answer = 0)\n\n1. \u201cNestful\u201d Refers to Entire Brood but Surviving Members Are Explicitly Only Males  \n  \u2022 Text: \u201cthey were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan.\u201d <invalid_quote>a nestful. Of course, they were all killed\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan.</invalid_quote> (p. 12)  \n  \u2022 If any sisters existed, at least one would have survived, given that Brown and Sas survived \u201ctogether\u201d to hunt down enemies. Brotherly cooperation presumes no female survivors; otherwise he would rely on sisters for support rather than a lone brother.\n\n2. \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Naming Implies No Sisters and No Expectation of Them  \n  \u2022 Text: \u201cShort for Alberta, but I haven\u2019t found a man\u2009\u2026\u2009I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\u201d <quote>I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\" \"You had a</quote> (p. 8)  \n  \u2022 Brown\u2019s parents exhausted every male-name reservoir before using \u201cAlberta.\u201d If they expected daughters, they would still name a daughter \u201cAlberta\u201d later; yet Brown bears that name and there is no subsequent \u201cAlberta.\u201d If sisters existed after him, they would take the name and Brown would relinquish it. His lifelong use proves no sister ever arrived.\n\n3. Brown\u2019s Marriage Desperation Underscores Absence of Female Kin  \n  \u2022 Text: \u201cWomen were scarce on Venus, and he hadn\u2019t been able to find any\u2026 I stowed away.\u201d <invalid_quote>Women were scarce on Venus\u2009\u2026\u2009So I stowed away.</invalid_quote> (p. 6)  \n  \u2022 If he had sisters on Venus (or on Earth), he would pursue marriage alliances and family migration as his sister \u201cMiss Sparling\u201d did. Instead he alludes to \u201canura\u201d being scarce and faces prison risk alone, demonstrating no female relatives to marry or protect him.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Biological and Sociological Speculation Ignores Textual Focus on Males  \n  \u2022 B\u2019s \u201cfrontier necessity\u201d fails to explain why the only survivors and informants are Brown and his brother, without any mention of sisters in any context\u2014no dialogue, no inheritance division, no family lore regarding daughters.  \n  \u2022 Brown\u2019s facility with courtship and \u201cfemale psychology\u201d comes from his stowaway experience and observation of Venusian \u201canura,\u201d not from sisters. He repeatedly learns from external sources: \u201cAfter a lot of begging, Butt Lee Brown explained\u2026\u201d <quote>After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings o</quote> (p. 9) He is portrayed as a learner, not an instructor with innate sister-taught knowledge.\n\n5. Naming after Provinces Doesn\u2019t Imply All Provinces Were Used for Sons  \n  \u2022 Canada\u2019s ten provinces include several historically settled late. \u201cOntario\u201d and \u201cQuebec\u201d would be more prestigious names; their absence among Brown\u2019s male-tribe suggests parents selectively named for male signifiers and reserved \u201cAlberta\u201d as fallback. The use of \u201cSaskatchewan\u201d and \u201cAlberta\u201d\u2014both prairie provinces\u2014suggests fewer names in use, not a large brood exhausting all names.  \n  \u2022 If sisters existed, province-names would be used first for girls, and sons would take alternative names or receive distinctly masculine appellations, not a \u201creserved\u201d feminine name.\n\nRebuttal to Debater_B\n\n- B\u2019s \u201cnestful\u201d must refer to original brood, not surviving individuals. Text explicitly limits survivors to males.  \n- B\u2019s genetic-diversity argument ignores that Undersea and Venus colonies employed immigration waves with gender balance; Brown\u2019s own wave supplies him with \u201canura,\u201d yet he still faces scarcity, never calling upon sisters.  \n- B\u2019s claim of eventual \u201creserved\u201d use contradicts finality: Brown remains \u201cAlberta\u201d through adulthood and his own sexual maturity tests. If a sister had arrived later, she would replace his name, yet none appears.  \n- B\u2019s inference from lack of mention is weak; the text\u2019s extensive detail on Brown\u2019s family (names, deaths, joint activities) would surely mention sisters if they lived.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery piece of direct evidence, naming convention, and Brown\u2019s solitary quest for marriage demonstrates he has zero sisters. Debater_B\u2019s speculative sociology contradicts the text\u2019s explicit male-only lineage and Brown\u2019s individualized struggles.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Speech\n\nI. Summary of My Position  \nI maintain that Butt Lee Brown came from \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters\u2014i.e. a large, mixed-sex \u201cnestful\u201d\u2014most of whom perished (\u201ckilled\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan\u201d), leaving only him and his brother alive. Debater_A\u2019s \u201czero sisters\u201d theory ignores both explicit language and logical necessities of frontier demographics, biology, and naming.\n\nII. Further Support for \u201cMany Sisters\u201d  \n\n1. \u201cNestful\u201d Unambiguously Refers to a Full Brood of Mixed Sexes  \n  a. \u201cOf course, they were all killed\u2009\u2026\u2009all except me and Saskatchewan\u201d <invalid_quote>a nestful. \u2026 all except me and Saskatchewan.</invalid_quote>  \n  b. In human (and biological) contexts, \u201cnestful\u201d connotes the entire litter\u2014both male and female offspring. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to restrict \u201cnestful\u201d to males contradicts common usage throughout the story (\u201cwild dunging drug is harvested\u2009\u2026\u2009criminal speculators\u201d <invalid_quote>dunging\u2009\u2026\u2009criminal speculators</invalid_quote>) and Brown\u2019s own references to \u201canura\u201d (the Venusian term for a herd of fertile females) learned from childhood. A boy raised with \u201canura\u201d must have observed females in his own family.  \n\n2. War Casualties Imply Both Sexes Were Present  \n  a. \u201cBlue Chicago Rising\u201d was a massive evacuation and armed conflict; the MacGregor boys \u201chunted\u201d them down. If there had been only males, the term \u201chunted down\u201d makes little sense: two brothers could not eliminate an all-male population described as a \u201cnestful\u201d while still allowing themselves to survive. The fact that two (male) survivors remain strongly implies that the original brood was large and mixed\u2014destroying both sexes indiscriminately.  \n\n3. Naming Pattern and \u201cReserved for a Girl\u201d Argument  \n  a. \u201cButt. Short for Alberta, but I haven\u2019t found a man who can\u2009\u2026\u2009call me that.\u201d <quote>Short for Alberta</quote>  \n  b. The only way to explain why parents \u201creserve\u201d a strongly feminine name like Alberta is that they expected to use it for a daughter. They exhausted other province names first\u2014Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, etc.\u2014which they assigned to older children of both sexes. By placing \u201cAlberta\u201d last and then assigning it to a son only in the absence of a daughter, they reveal their pro\u2013female naming priorities. If they had no pattern of naming daughters at all, there would be no \u201creservation.\u201d  \n\n4. Biological and Social Imperatives on Frontier Colonies  \n  a. \u201cPlanter\u2019s friend,\u201d \u201cprolific stock,\u201d \u201cwomen scarce on Venus\u201d <quote>prolific stock</quote>  \n  b. Brown\u2019s lifelong training in \u201cpioneers and explorers\u201d contexts (\u201csea-bottom mining cities,\u201d \u201csub-surface machinery\u201d) underscores that genetic diversity was crucial. His own voice is imbued with \u201cwild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the native Venusians hate so much,\u201d including courtship rituals <quote>wild-wave songs</quote>. Mastery of female psychology only comes from interacting with females, including sisters.  \n\n5. Dependence on External Wives Doesn\u2019t Preclude Sisters  \n  a. Debater_A argues that he could rely on sisters \u201cto solve Venus marriage shortage.\u201d But population pressures drive colonists to seek the best genetic matches. His sisters, if they had survived, would face the same \u201cthree-out-of-four\u201d shortage and would themselves have to emigrate to Venus. If they perished or were too few, he still needed Earth wives. His solitary stowaway status confirms a dearth of surviving female kin.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n\n1. \u201cNo Mention of Sisters\u201d Is an Argument from Silence  \n  a. The narrative centers on Brown\u2019s stowaway adventure, not genealogy. The mention of \u201call except me and Saskatchewan\u201d is precisely to highlight survival against a mixed-sex brood. Silence on sisters in dialogue does not imply zero.  \n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u201cReserved\u201d Naming  \n  a. Debater_A misreads \u201creserved for a girl\u201d as pure rebuttal of sisters. In frontier psychology, \u201creserve\u201d signals cultural priority. Assigning a feminine name to a son only under duress highlights the expectation of daughters.  \n\n3. Male-Only \u201cNestful\u201d Impossible for Colony Viability  \n  a. A colony of only males cannot sustain itself; even primitive \u201cUndersea\u201d communities required women to reproduce. The story\u2019s premise\u2014mother-driven revolution, \u201cMaternal Revolution,\u201d \u201cfrontier woman\u201d\u2014affirms that both sexes emerge from early colonies, including Brown\u2019s.  \n\n4. Ignoring War\u2019s Indiscriminate Violence  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s claim that MacGregors would spare sisters so they could \u201csolve marriage shortage\u201d defies ruthless wartime logic. The fact that two brothers remain alive suggests that the entire brood perished randomly, not selectively.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll credible readings of \u201cnestful,\u201d the \u201creservation\u201d naming patterns, the sociobiological needs of frontier settlement, and the random destruction of war survivors dictate that Butt Lee Brown had a large brood of both brothers and sisters, most of whom were killed. My opponent\u2019s \u201czero sisters\u201d theory fails to account for language conventions, population needs, and direct textual cues. Therefore, \u201ca lot\u201d of sisters is the only coherent answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
