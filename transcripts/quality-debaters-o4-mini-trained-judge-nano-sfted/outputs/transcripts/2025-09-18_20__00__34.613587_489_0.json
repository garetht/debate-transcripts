{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 489, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What is not a lesson the author gleaned from the book?", "first_debater_answer": "Extremists are usually the most courageous people", "second_debater_answer": "Innovating is better than criticizing", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What is not a lesson the author gleaned from the book?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not a lesson the author gleaned from the book?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Innovating is better than criticizing\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Extremists are usually the most courageous people\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Extremists are usually the most courageous people\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is not one of the author\u2019s gleaned lessons. By contrast, the author consistently emphasizes moderation, mutual understanding, and the perils of polarization.  \n\n2. Evidence from the Gleaned Lessons  \n\u2022 The author advises: <quote>\"Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.\"</quote>  \n  \u2013 This explicit statement (<quote>middle, not the extremes</quote>) underscores that courage resides in moderation, not extremism.  \n\u2022 She warns: <quote>\"Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own.\"</quote> and <quote>\"Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win.\"</quote>  \n  \u2013 Extremists \u201cobstruct\u201d or \u201cseize upon the weakest examples,\u201d contrary to her advice.  \n\u2022 She deplores \u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and laments \u201cthe culture of critique\u201d that obsessively pursues scandal for its own sake.  \n  \u2013 Extremists epitomize these behaviors, which she treats as maladies to be cured.  \n\n3. Logical Argument  \n\u2022 If extremism were a lesson, she would commend belligerence against \u201ctyrants\u201d alone. Instead, she admits belligerence only in \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d against life-threatening enemies (e.g., Hitler). Yet even there, she stresses proper \u201cargumentation\u201d and \u201cvigilance\u201d rather than glorifying extremism.  \n\u2022 She proposes Asian consensual formats to reduce debate, seeking harmony over combative zeal. Extremists thrive on debate, so her recommendations directly oppose their methods.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B (\u201cInnovating Is Better Than Criticizing\u201d)  \n\u2022 They misread the author\u2019s advice \u201cbuild your own\u201d as hostility to criticism. In context, she condemns \u201coversimplify[ing]\u201d and ignoring \u201cfacts that support your opponent\u2019s views,\u201d not reasoned critique essential to refining ideas.  \n\u2022 The author actually champions \u201cscrutiny\u201d of power: she supports press \u201cwar on inflation\u201d and investigations of public figures in \u201cWorld War II\u201d vs. \u201clonely war\u201d analogy to Hitler. That is critical oversight, not mere innovation.  \n\u2022 \u201cInnovating\u201d alone, without criticism, would allow \u201cmalpractice,\u201d \u201cpropaganda,\u201d and \u201cscandal\u201d to go unchecked, precisely the problems she laments (e.g., \u201ctorturing Princess Diana,\u201d \u201cWhitewater investigation\u201d as too tolerant or too harsh only by political faction).  \n\u2022 Therefore \u201cinnovating is better than criticizing\u201d misrepresents her balanced counsel: she values both \u201clistening and learning\u201d and \u201cfocus on substance,\u201d which includes testing ideas through reasoned critique.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nAll explicit lessons champion moderation, mutual respect, and the middle ground. Extremism is cited solely as a problem needing containment. Thus \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is not a lesson the author gleaned, and \u201cinnovating is better than criticizing\u201d mischaracterizes her nuanced endorsement of both creativity and reasoned critique.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position  \nI defend that the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not a lesson the author gleaned from the book?\u201d is \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing.\u201d In other words, this choice does *not* appear as one of the author\u2019s own \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning\u201d points\u2014even though it may sound congenial.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \n\n1. Context of the Sage Advice  \n  a. The review\u2019s list of \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning from her book\u201d (para. 3) is prefaced: \u201cAll this is sage advice\u2014for couples, for families, \u2026 maybe even for book reviewers.\u201d <quote> maybe even for book reviewers.</quote> signals that these precepts apply to *private*, interpersonal \u201csphere of snuggle,\u201d not to public or policy arenas.  \n  b. Tannen herself, when addressing \u201ccontentious public discourse,\u201d explicitly *rejects* free, aggressive scrutiny: <quote>ld wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. </quote> (para. 13) and proposes a one-guest Japanese TV format to *limit* debate (para. 14). This is the opposite of \u201cbuild your own\u201d in the public sphere.  \n\n2. Tannen\u2019s Rejection of Critique and Innovation in Public Policy  \n  a. She deems \u201cbirth control and sex education\u201d settled and refuses to debate: <invalid_quote>\u201cdisseminating birth control \u2026 is the best way to reduce the abortion rate\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 13). If no debate is allowed, there is no \u201cinnovation\u201d or alternatives to test.  \n  b. She praises authoritarian legal systems where judges *alone* determine guilt (para. 15), further suppressing adversarial innovation in evidence and argument.  \n\n3. Reviewer's Critique of Tannen\u2019s Own Oversimplification  \n  a. The reviewer faults her \u201ctemptation to oversimplify\u201d and \u201cseize upon the weakest examples\u201d in order \u201cto make the \u2018argument culture\u2019 wrong\u201d (para. 5). If Tannen herself disdains nuance, she cannot be truly endorsing the creative, multi-sided exploration that \u201cinnovation\u201d implies.  \n  b.

Conclusion  \nBecause \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d conflicts with Tannen\u2019s consistent mistrust of public debate, her advocacy of filtered, deferential, and middle-only discourse, and her own oversimplifications, it does *not* belong among the lessons \u201cworth gleaning.\u201d By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s choice about extremists runs directly contrary to the book\u2019s repeated praise for moderation and disapproval of belligerence.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not a lesson the author gleaned from the book?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Extremists are usually the most courageous people\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Innovating is better than criticizing\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Innovating is better than criticizing\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI.

Supporting Arguments  \n\n1. Context of the Sage Advice  \n  a. The review\u2019s list of \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning from her book\u201d (para. 3) is prefaced: \u201cAll this is sage advice\u2014for couples, for families, \u2026 maybe even for book reviewers.\u201d <quote> maybe even for book reviewers.</quote> signals that these precepts apply to *private*, interpersonal \u201csphere of snuggle,\u201d not to public or policy arenas.  \n  b. Tannen herself, when addressing \u201ccontentious public discourse,\u201d explicitly *rejects* free, aggressive scrutiny: <quote>ld wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. </quote> (para. 13) and proposes a one-guest Japanese TV format to *limit* debate (para. 14). This is the opposite of \u201cbuild your own\u201d in the public sphere.  \n\n2. Tannen\u2019s Rejection of Critique and Innovation in Public Policy  \n  a. She deems \u201cbirth control and sex education\u201d settled and refuses to debate: <invalid_quote>\u201cdisseminating birth control \u2026 is the best way to reduce the abortion rate\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 13). If no debate is allowed, there is no \u201cinnovation\u201d or alternatives to test.  \n  b. She praises authoritarian legal systems where judges *alone* determine guilt (para. 15), further suppressing adversarial innovation in evidence and argument.  \n\n3. Reviewer's Critique of Tannen\u2019s Own Oversimplification  \n  a. The reviewer faults her \u201ctemptation to oversimplify\u201d and \u201cseize upon the weakest examples\u201d in order \u201cto make the \u2018argument culture\u2019 wrong\u201d (para. 5). If Tannen herself disdains nuance, she cannot be truly endorsing the creative, multi-sided exploration that \u201cinnovation\u201d implies.  \n  b. The reviewer labels her project \u201cpainting a general theory of discord\u201d that is \u201cless perceptive than its parts\u201d (para. 1). A genuine commitment to building one\u2019s own solutions would have produced a more robust thesis.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A  \nDebater_A contends that \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is *not* a lesson gleaned. In fact:  \n\n1. Tannen extols \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes\u201d (para. 3). That is an explicit lesson *against* extremism. Claiming courage lies at extremes contradicts <quote> Truth and courage often lie in the middle, </quote>  \n\n2. She condemns belligerent war metaphors when praising Greenspan\u2019s war on inflation only *because* it protects us from real thugs; she values judicious struggle rather than extreme zeal (para. 6).  \n\n3. Her whole \u201cargument culture\u201d critique targets excessive, sensational, and polarized tactics\u2014the very hallmark of \u201cextremists\u201d (para. 5, 13, 14).  \n\nTherefore \u201cextremists as courageous\u201d is contradicted repeatedly; it *is* a lesson she rejects, not one she espouses.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nBecause \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d conflicts with Tannen\u2019s consistent mistrust of public debate, her advocacy of filtered, deferential, and middle-only discourse, and her own oversimplifications, it does *not* belong among the lessons \u201cworth gleaning.\u201d By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s choice about extremists runs directly contrary to the book\u2019s repeated praise for moderation and disapproval of belligerence. I urge the judge to rule in favor of \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is not one of the author\u2019s gleaned lessons. By contrast, the author consistently emphasizes moderation, mutual understanding, and the perils of polarization.  \n\n2. Evidence from the Gleaned Lessons  \n\u2022 The author advises: <quote>\"Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.\"</quote>  \n  \u2013 This explicit statement (<quote>middle, not the extremes</quote>) underscores that courage resides in moderation, not extremism.  \n\u2022 She warns: <quote>\"Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own.\"</quote> and <quote>\"Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win.\"</quote>  \n  \u2013 Extremists \u201cobstruct\u201d or \u201cseize upon the weakest examples,\u201d contrary to her advice.  \n\u2022 She deplores \u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and laments \u201cthe culture of critique\u201d that obsessively pursues scandal for its own sake.  \n  \u2013 Extremists epitomize these behaviors, which she treats as maladies to be cured.  \n\n3. Logical Argument  \n\u2022 If extremism were a lesson, she would commend belligerence against \u201ctyrants\u201d alone. Instead, she admits belligerence only in \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d against life-threatening enemies (e.g., Hitler). Yet even there, she stresses proper \u201cargumentation\u201d and \u201cvigilance\u201d rather than glorifying extremism.  \n\u2022 She proposes Asian consensual formats to reduce debate, seeking harmony over combative zeal. Extremists thrive on debate, so her recommendations directly oppose their methods.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B (\u201cInnovating Is Better Than Criticizing\u201d)  \n\u2022 They misread the author\u2019s advice \u201cbuild your own\u201d as hostility to criticism. In context, she condemns \u201coversimplify[ing]\u201d and ignoring \u201cfacts that support your opponent\u2019s views,\u201d not reasoned critique essential to refining ideas.  \n\u2022 The author actually champions \u201cscrutiny\u201d of power: she supports press \u201cwar on inflation\u201d and investigations of public figures in \u201cWorld War II\u201d vs. \u201clonely war\u201d analogy to Hitler. That is critical oversight, not mere innovation.  \n\u2022 \u201cInnovating\u201d alone, without criticism, would allow \u201cmalpractice,\u201d \u201cpropaganda,\u201d and \u201cscandal\u201d to go unchecked, precisely the problems she laments (e.g., \u201ctorturing Princess Diana,\u201d \u201cWhitewater investigation\u201d as too tolerant or too harsh only by political faction).  \n\u2022 Therefore \u201cinnovating is better than criticizing\u201d misrepresents her balanced counsel: she values both \u201clistening and learning\u201d and \u201cfocus on substance,\u201d which includes testing ideas through reasoned critique.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nAll explicit lessons champion moderation, mutual respect, and the middle ground. Extremism is cited solely as a problem needing containment. Thus \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is not a lesson the author gleaned, and \u201cinnovating is better than criticizing\u201d mischaracterizes her nuanced endorsement of both creativity and reasoned critique.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Innovating is better than criticizing\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Thus \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is not a lesson the author gleaned, and \u201cinnovating is better than criticizing\u201d mischaracterizes her nuanced endorsement of both creativity and reasoned critique.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. My Position  \nI defend that the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not a lesson the author gleaned from the book?\u201d is \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing.\u201d In other words, this choice does *not* appear as one of the author\u2019s own \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning\u201d points\u2014even though it may sound congenial.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \n\n1. Context of the Sage Advice  \n  a. The review\u2019s list of \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning from her book\u201d (para. 3) is prefaced: \u201cAll this is sage advice\u2014for couples, for families, \u2026 maybe even for book reviewers.\u201d <quote> maybe even for book reviewers.</quote> signals that these precepts apply to *private*, interpersonal \u201csphere of snuggle,\u201d not to public or policy arenas.  \n  b. Tannen herself, when addressing \u201ccontentious public discourse,\u201d explicitly *rejects* free, aggressive scrutiny: <quote>ld wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. </quote> (para. 13) and proposes a one-guest Japanese TV format to *limit* debate (para. 14). This is the opposite of \u201cbuild your own\u201d in the public sphere.  \n\n2. Tannen\u2019s Rejection of Critique and Innovation in Public Policy  \n  a. She deems \u201cbirth control and sex education\u201d settled and refuses to debate: <invalid_quote>\u201cdisseminating birth control \u2026 is the best way to reduce the abortion rate\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 13). If no debate is allowed, there is no \u201cinnovation\u201d or alternatives to test.  \n  b. She praises authoritarian legal systems where judges *alone* determine guilt (para. 15), further suppressing adversarial innovation in evidence and argument.  \n\n3. Reviewer's Critique of Tannen\u2019s Own Oversimplification  \n  a. The reviewer faults her \u201ctemptation to oversimplify\u201d and \u201cseize upon the weakest examples\u201d in order \u201cto make the \u2018argument culture\u2019 wrong\u201d (para. 5). If Tannen herself disdains nuance, she cannot be truly endorsing the creative, multi-sided exploration that \u201cinnovation\u201d implies.  \n  b. The reviewer labels her project \u201cpainting a general theory of discord\u201d that is \u201cless perceptive than its parts\u201d (para. 1). A genuine commitment to building one\u2019s own solutions would have produced a more robust thesis.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A  \nDebater_A contends that \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is *not* a lesson gleaned. In fact:  \n\n1. Tannen extols \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes\u201d (para. 3). That is an explicit lesson *against* extremism. Claiming courage lies at extremes contradicts <quote> Truth and courage often lie in the middle, </quote>  \n\n2. She condemns belligerent war metaphors when praising Greenspan\u2019s war on inflation only *because* it protects us from real thugs; she values judicious struggle rather than extreme zeal (para. 6).  \n\n3. Her whole \u201cargument culture\u201d critique targets excessive, sensational, and polarized tactics\u2014the very hallmark of \u201cextremists\u201d (para. 5, 13, 14).  \n\nTherefore \u201cextremists as courageous\u201d is contradicted repeatedly; it *is* a lesson she rejects, not one she espouses.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nBecause \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d conflicts with Tannen\u2019s consistent mistrust of public debate, her advocacy of filtered, deferential, and middle-only discourse, and her own oversimplifications, it does *not* belong among the lessons \u201cworth gleaning.\u201d By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s choice about extremists runs directly contrary to the book\u2019s repeated praise for moderation and disapproval of belligerence. I urge the judge to rule in favor of \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \nI affirm that \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is *not* one of the author\u2019s gleaned lessons. The author\u2019s explicit statements valorize the moderate \u201cmiddle,\u201d mutual understanding, and reasoned scrutiny\u2014not zealotry or polarized fervor.  \n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence Against Extremism as Courage  \n\u2022 <quote> Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. </quote> (para. 3)  \n  \u2013 This unequivocal declaration locates courage in moderation.  \n\u2022 The author groups \u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d (para. 5) as symptoms of the \u201cargument culture\u201d that \u201cpoisons\u201d both public and private spheres.  \n  \u2013 Extremists epitomize obstructionism by \u201cseizing upon the weakest examples\u201d (<quote>\"When there is a need to make others wrong,</quote>, para. 5), precisely what she condemns.  \n\u2022 In foreign policy and law enforcement, she accepts \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d only against genuine threats (e.g., Hitler), not as a universal principle. Yet she still laments soldiers\u2019 dehumanization (para. 7) and urges proper \u201cargumentation\u201d where possible. Combat is a last resort, not a model for all discourse.  \n\n3. Why \u201cInnovating Is Better Than Criticizing\u201d Is Not a Lesson  \n\u2022 Direct Praise for Scrutiny:  \n  \u2013 She lauds the press\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d (para. 6) and investigative inquiries (e.g., \u201cWorld War II\u2026fighting Hitler\u201d) as safeguarding society.  \n  \u2013 <quote>by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies</quote> (para. 9) is criticized only insofar as it leads to sensationalism, not the idea of scrutiny itself. Proper fact\u2010checking is necessary.  \n\u2022 Balanced View of Technology: She condemns E-mail and Lexis-Nexis only when they produce hasty, ill\u2010considered mass messaging or sensational \u201ccritiques\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cbroadcast messages\u2026without thinking\u201d</invalid_quote>, para. 9). This is a call for thoughtful critique, not its elimination.  \n\u2022 Proposals for Reform, Not Abolition of Critique:  \n  \u2013 Her Japanese one\u2010guest format (para. 14) is a *limited* recommendation for decorum, akin to an academic seminar, not a blanket ban on questioning.  \n  \u2013 Her courtroom reform suggestions (para. 15) target *inhumane* cross\u2010examinations, particularly of vulnerable witnesses, not the principle of testing evidence.  \n\n4. Rebutting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cInnovate Over Criticize\u201d  \n\u2022 Misreading \u201cBuild Your Own\u201d:  \n  \u2013 <quote> Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. </quote> (para. 3) applies to petty, endless quibbling, not to reasoned challenge of dangerous or flawed policies. She explicitly *praises* meaningful public scrutiny of powerful actors.  \n\u2022 Contradiction in B\u2019s Own Evidence:  \n  \u2013 Debater_B points to Tannen\u2019s desire to suppress debate on settled issues (abortion, global warming) to argue against criticism. But suppression occurs only when issues have reached \u201cbroad bipartisan and public consensus\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 13</invalid_quote>). That is a pragmatic shift from critique to implementation, not an eternal rule.  \n  \u2013 Even in \u201csettled\u201d cases, her fear is *falsehood* and \u201cpropaganda\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201csimilar to verbal manipulations\u2026Nazi era\u201d</invalid_quote>, para. 13), implying she values critique to expose lies until genuine consensus exists.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency of My Choice  \nIf \u201cextremists are courageous\u201d were a gleaned lesson, she would:  \n\u2022 Commend unrestrained debate as sign of courage; instead, she warns it \u201cpoisons\u201d relationships and demands restraint and \u201clistening.\u201d  \n\u2022 Praise partisan obstructionism as heroic; instead, she condemns blocking \u201cgood ideas just so you can win.\u201d  \n\n6. Addressing B\u2019s Claim of Oversimplification  \n\u2022 While Tannen\u2019s own arguments sometimes oversimplify, the *reviewer\u2019s* critique (<quote> painting a general theory of discord.</quote>, para. 1) does not transform her advice. The judge must decide based on *her stated lessons*, not her consistency. We *literally* see a list of positive prescriptions, all moderate.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \nEvery explicit \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning\u201d lesson endorses moderation, mutual respect, and balanced public scrutiny. Extremism is repeatedly cast as a problem to be contained. Critique\u2014properly conducted\u2014is explicitly endorsed as necessary to safeguard truth and society. Therefore, \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d is *not* a lesson gleaned, while \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d misreads her nuanced call for thoughtful challenge. I urge the Judge to accept my answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Case  \nI maintain that \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d is *not* one of the lessons Tannen \u201cgleaned\u201d\u2014and so it answers \u201cWhat is not a lesson\u2026?\u201d Debater_A\u2019s rival answer (\u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d) is flatly contradicted by repeated counsel to shun extremes (<quote>Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.</quote> para.3).  \n\nII. Further Support for My Answer  \n\n1. \u201cBuild your own\u201d Is About Interpersonal Understanding, Not Policy Innovation  \n  a. The reviewer says \u201cDon\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own\u201d applies to \u201ccouples\u2026book reviewers\u201d (para.3). <quote> maybe even for book reviewers.</quote> signals a *private*, interpretive exercise\u2014learning another\u2019s viewpoint\u2014rather than inventing policy from scratch.  \n  b. In sharp contrast, Tannen\u2019s public\u2010sphere prescriptions aim to *limit* debate: she would \u201ccover our ears\u201d to filter \u201cstrife\u201d (para.13) and adopt one-guest TV formats (para.14), precluding the very contest of ideas innovation requires.  \n\n2. Explicit Distrust of Public Innovation and Open Scrutiny  \n  a. She deems key policy questions \u201csettled\u201d (e.g., birth control, global warming; para.13), refusing to entertain alternatives. If \u201cinnovating\u201d were prized, she would welcome dissent, yet she penalizes \u201cview of government as the enemy\u201d (para.13) as beyond debate.  \n  b. She endorses inquisitorial legal models (French, German) where judges\u2014*not* adversarial counsel\u2014\u201cintimate belief\u2026of what happened\u201d suffices (para.15). This system discourages counternarratives and the \u201cinnovation\u201d of new defenses.  \n\n3. Her Own Oversimplifications Undermine Innovation  \n  a. The reviewer faults her \u201ctemptation to oversimplify\u201d in order \u201cto make the \u2018argument culture\u2019 wrong\u201d (para.5). A truly innovation\u2010friendly thinker would embrace nuance, not \u201cseize upon the weakest examples.\u201d  \n  b. \u201cThe whole is less perceptive than its parts\u201d (para.1) because she wields generic \u201cdiscord\u201d categories without generating fresh insight.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A  \n\n1. Misreading \u201cBuild Your Own\u201d  \n  Debater_A treats \u201cbuild your own\u201d as policy invention. But context (\u201ccouples,\u201d \u201cbook reviewers\u201d) and her *rejection* of public dissent show it is a *listening* tool, not license to overthrow consensus.  \n\n2. \u201cScrutiny\u201d Only Within Narrow \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d  \n  Debater_A cites her praise for press \u201cwar on inflation\u201d and WWII vigilance. But that is a *limited exception*\u2014fighting Hitler\u2014\u201csphere of struggle\u201d against *real* tyrants (para.6). By her own admission, belligerence in \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d elsewhere \u201cpoisons\u201d intimate ties (para.2). She does *not* generalize it to freewheeling innovation in all policy arenas.  \n\n3. Mischaracterizing Her Call for \u201cReasoned Critique\u201d  \n  \u2022 She condemns \u201cseizing upon the weakest examples\u201d and ignoring favorable evidence (para.5). That is not reasoned critique but *strategic* attack.  \n  \u2022 Even the Whitewater and Diana examples show her complaint is *excessive* sensationalism, not balanced testing of hypotheses.  \n\n4. \u201cExtremists as Courageous\u201d Fails on Its Own Terms  \n  Debater_A\u2019s own admission: \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle\u201d (<quote>middle, not the extremes</quote> para.3). The book\u2019s relentless critique of \u201cpartisanship, obstructionism, gridlock\u201d (para.5) shows she sees *extremists* as the disease.  \n\nIV. Why My Answer Best Fits \u201cNot a Lesson\u201d  \n  \u2022 Every item in the \u201cworth gleaning\u201d list (para.3) is *restrictive* (don\u2019t quarrel, don\u2019t fight small issues, don\u2019t portray all as scandal). Embracing unbounded innovation would violate \u201cdon\u2019t obstruct good ideas\u201d only if one *criticizes* enough to expose flaws\u2014rather than forging new paths.  \n  \u2022 Her call for Asian \u201charmony\u201d formats (para.14) confirms she prizes consensus over invention.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n\u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d starkly conflicts with her repeated efforts to *curtail* public debate, filter dissent, and glorify only measured vigilance in narrow contexts. By contrast, \u201cExtremists are usually the most courageous people\u201d runs directly against her explicit middle\u2010of\u2010the\u2010road motto. I urge the judge to recognize \u201cInnovating is better than criticizing\u201d as *not* a lesson she gleaned.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
