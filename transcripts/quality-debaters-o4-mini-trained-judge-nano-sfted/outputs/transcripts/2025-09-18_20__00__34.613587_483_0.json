    "background_text": "TIME and the WOMAN By Dewey, G. Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" ",

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did the spaceship travel faster than the speed of light during their flight?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Twice\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Twice\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did the spaceship travel faster than the speed of light during their flight?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Once\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Once\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Text Distinguishes Two \u201cLight\u2010Drive\u201d Phases by Audible and Sensory Cues  \n    A.  Outbound Activation:  \n        \u2022  \u201cThe yammering rockets cut off, and the ship\u2026poised\u2026on the ebon lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\u201d (p. 22) marks the first transition from sub\u2010light to superluminal.  \n        \u2022  Ninon, \u201csick and shaken,\u201d \u201cstumbled back into the acceleration sling,\u201d \u201cThe light drive!\u201d she murmurs (p. 21). Only active drive can induce the torturous frequencies she feels.  \n    B.  Inbound Activation:  \n        \u2022  After \u201chalfway point\u201d turn, the narrator again highlights agonizing high\u2010frequency whine: \u201cThen she heard it. A low moan\u2026 climbing\u2026nerve\u2010plucking\u2026up beyond hearing\u2026and up and up \u2026 The light drive!\u201d (p. 23\u201324). She is in the sling again, \u201cgaining strength, and\u2014she knew\u2014youth.\u201d  \n        \u2022  If no second activation occurred, no whine could be heard, no additional rejuvenation would take place, and the ship could never decelerate safely through superluminal speeds to re\u2010enter the galaxy.\n\n2.  Continuous Rejuvenation Demands Ongoing Superluminal Exposure Until Final Cut\u2010Off  \n    \u2022  \u201cLong hours she rested in the sling, gaining strength \u2026 she would still continue to grow younger and younger\u2026 while the ship lands.\u201d (p. 24\u201325)  \n    \u2022  Aging resumes only \u201cwhen the drive is cut off\u201d near the end: immediately after Deceleration completes, Ninon \u201clies dead\u2026and alone,\u201d aged to decrepitude (p. 31).

        "speech": "Debater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Second Affirmative\n\nI continue to affirm that the ship employed its \u201clight drive\u201d twice\u2014outbound and again inbound\u2014and that Debater_B\u2019s \u201conce\u2010only\u201d theory contradicts both the text and basic relativistic mechanics of turning a superluminal vessel around.\n\n1.  The Text Distinguishes Two \u201cLight\u2010Drive\u201d Phases by Audible and Sensory Cues  \n    A.  Outbound Activation:  \n        \u2022  \u201cThe yammering rockets cut off, and the ship\u2026poised\u2026on the ebon lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\u201d (p. 22) marks the first transition from sub\u2010light to superluminal.  \n        \u2022  Ninon, \u201csick and shaken,\u201d \u201cstumbled back into the acceleration sling,\u201d \u201cThe light drive!\u201d she murmurs (p. 21).

Inbound Activation:  \n        \u2022  After \u201chalfway point\u201d turn, the narrator again highlights agonizing high\u2010frequency whine: \u201cThen she heard it. A low moan\u2026 climbing\u2026nerve\u2010plucking\u2026up beyond hearing\u2026and up and up \u2026 The light drive!\u201d (p. 23\u201324). She is in the sling again, \u201cgaining strength, and\u2014she knew\u2014youth.\u201d  \n        \u2022  If no second activation occurred, no whine could be heard, no additional rejuvenation would take place, and the ship could never decelerate safely through superluminal speeds to re\u2010enter the galaxy.\n\n2.  Continuous Rejuvenation Demands Ongoing Superluminal Exposure Until Final Cut\u2010Off  \n    \u2022  \u201cLong hours she rested in the sling, gaining strength \u2026 she would still continue to grow younger and younger\u2026 while the ship lands.\u201d (p. 24\u201325)  \n    \u2022  Aging resumes only \u201cwhen the drive is cut off\u201d near the end: immediately after Deceleration completes, Ninon \u201clies dead\u2026and alone,\u201d aged to decrepitude (p. 31).

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nTIME and the WOMAN By Dewey, G. Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did the spaceship travel faster than the speed of light during their flight?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Twice\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A Opening Statement\n\nI affirm that the ship exceeded light speed twice\u2014once outbound and once inbound\u2014contrary to Debater_B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d theory. My position rests on clear textual evidence and the physics of relativistic turnaround. I will:\n\n1. Show two distinct \u201clight\u2010drive\u201d phases: acceleration beyond light speed when leaving Earth\u2019s galaxy and a second \u201clight\u2010drive\u201d during the return trip.  \n2. Explain that \u201ccutting off\u201d and \u201cautomatic control\u201d do not negate a second superluminal phase.  \n3. Expose Debater_B\u2019s misreadings and logical inconsistencies.\n\nArgument 1: Distinct Outbound Superluminal Phase  \n\u2022 \u201cThe light drive cut in at the planned time\u201d (outbound)  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd still it climbed\u2026 The light drive! \u2026 \u2018We are approaching the speed of light.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018We are nearly twice light speed.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 This unequivocally describes acceleration through and beyond light speed into deep space.\n\nArgument 2: Second Superluminal for Return (Deceleration Is Inverse Superluminal)  \n\u2022 \u201cLong hours she rested \u2026 halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth\u201d (return)  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd she would still continue to grow younger and younger\u2026 The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it found its way back into the galaxy.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\u2022 Physics of relativity: to decelerate from superluminal speeds requires a symmetric inverse superluminal thrust\u2014i.e. using the same drive to reverse velocity faster than light. The text\u2019s explicit \u201cdecelerated\u201d motion through space and landing implies the light drive was again active in reverse.  \n\u2022 Merely \u201ccut off\u201d during remainder of deceleration (at sub\u2010light speeds near the system) does not mean the return superluminal phase did not occur; the ship must re\u2010accelerate to break light\u2010speed barrier and then cut it as it approaches final orbital insertion and landing.\n\nArgument 3: Textual Markers of Return Superluminal Effects  \n\u2022 Observers note the ship \u201cpoised on the ebon lip\u201d and then \u201cpoised \u2026 lowering itself.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The \u201cpoised\u201d state at \u201chalfway point\u201d indicates a turn\u2010around at superluminal velocity.  \n\u2022 She continues to grow younger \u201cwhile the ship lands,\u201d showing continued exposure to superluminal time\u2010reversal until deceleration completes.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOnce\u201d Position  \n1. Misreads \u201ccut off\u201d as negating return phase\u2014ignores necessity of superluminal drive to effect deceleration from superluminal speeds.  \n2. Offers no alternative mechanism for reversing velocity or recapturing the ship into the Solar System at non\u2010lethal deceleration rates.  \n3. Fails to explain Ninon\u2019s continuing rejuvenation during the return leg (\u201cshe would still continue to grow younger\u201d)\u2014if no second superluminal, aging would resume and no benefit.  \n4. Ignores the author\u2019s consistent theme that only \u201clight drive\u201d manipulates time (\u201cif people travel faster than light, a lot faster, they\u2019ll grow younger\u201d); landing alone cannot reverse aging.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly two superluminal phases\u2014outbound and inverse inbound\u2014fulfill both the narrative and relativistic requirements. Debater_B\u2019s single phase leaves return unaccounted, contradicts Ninon\u2019s continuous rejuvenation, and violates the text\u2019s own reliance on \u201clight drive\u201d for time\u2010reversal. I therefore conclude the ship traveled faster than light twice.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement \u2014 \u201cOnce, Not Twice\u201d  \n\nMajor Premise: The narrative clearly describes only one use of the light\u2010drive \u201cbeyond light speed,\u201d namely the acceleration phase under active \u201clight drive.\u201d All subsequent motion, including the return, is either automatic deceleration or inertial coasting at sub\u2010light speeds.  \n\n1.  \u201cLight drive\u201d is explicitly introduced and cut off once.  \n    \u2022  <quote> The yammering rockets cut off,</quote> \u2026<quote> The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"</quote> (p. 20)  \n    \u2022  <quote> The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated a</quote> (p. 28)  \n    \u2022  \u201cCut off\u201d indicates the end of active superluminal propulsion. What follows is \u201cautomatic control\u201d and \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not a second superluminal thrust.  \n\n2.  References to star motion after midpoint are a consequence of inertia and relativistic effects, not renewed light\u2010drive activation.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the stars of the far galaxies beginning to wheel\u2026turning to speed back\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 24)  \n    \u2022  At the midpoint the ship\u2019s course reverses inertially; the \u201cwheeling stars\u201d merely indicate vector inversion. No mention is made of re\u2010engaging the light drive.  \n\n3.  \u201cNearly twice light speed\u201d and \u201cmany times light\u201d appear only once, during the forward acceleration.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201cHow fast are we going now?\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe are approaching the speed of light.\u201d \u2026 \u201cNearly twice light speed.\u201d \u2026 \u201cMany times the speed of light.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 22, 23)  \n    \u2022  All these speed increases occur prior to the \u201chalf\u2010way point\u201d and before deceleration begins.  \n\n4.  The protagonist experiences regained youth only under active superluminal conditions. As soon as deceleration and coasting proceed, she again ages\u2014proof she is no longer traveling faster than light.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026you\u2019re looking your age, Ninon.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe ship is on automatic control\u2026nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 28\u201329)  \n    \u2022  If superluminal travel reversed aging, continued return would have produced further rejuvenation. Instead, aging resumes immediately upon light\u2010drive cutoff.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTwice\u201d Argument:  \n\nA1. Misreading \u201cautomatic control\u201d as a second drive.  \n    \u2022  \u201cAutomatic control\u201d refers to guidance and deceleration, not propulsion beyond light speed. Rockets are \u201cyammering\u201d only in initial acceleration; no rockets are ever reactivated.  \n\nA2. Confusing inertial reversal for active second superluminal phase.  \n    \u2022  In relativistic mechanics, inertia carries the ship through the turnaround; the narrative states \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not re-acceleration. The crew expects a \u201cbreak\u201d (rest) only during the superluminal phase; no such rest occurs on return.  \n\nA3. Absence of \u201clights off\u2013lights on\u201d or chimes during return.  \n    \u2022  The only audible signal marking drive phases is the golden bell at start; no bell summons deceleration or return. If \u201clight drive\u201d were re-engaged, it would likewise signal it, just as at the outset.  \n\nA4. Protagonist\u2019s fate on landing indicates lack of superluminal return.  \n    \u2022  She lands on an alien world, not Earth, indicating mis\u2010navigation perhaps due to lack of drive control. If she had maintained superluminal control, she would have returned to Earth.  \n\nConclusion: All explicit textual evidence points to a single superluminal acceleration (\u201clight drive\u201d) phase. The return voyage is passive deceleration and inertial coasting at sub\u2010light speeds. Only \u201cOnce\u201d can be correct.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Twice\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

She pleads \u201cmake it go faster\u201d and Robert says \u201cnothing we can do but wait.\u201d No mention or bell signals a second activation.  \n2. If a second drive existed, the same \u201cgolden\u2010voiced bell\u201d or \u201csuave, perfumed dusk\u201d lighting sequence would mark it, just as at departure; the text provides none.  \n\nII. Inertial Turnaround vs. Active Propulsion  \n1. \u201cLong hours she rested\u2026halfway point and was turning to speed back\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the stars\u2026beginning to wheel\u2026she knew that the ship had reached the halfway point and was turning to speed back\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 24)  \n   \u2022 In relativity, turning at high inertia need only slight attitude control; no thrust is needed \u201cbeyond light speed\u201d to swing around and coast back. The narrative speaks only of \u201cautomatic control\u201d and \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not \u201clight drive.\u201d  \n2. \u201cAutomatic control throughout\u2026nothing we can do but wait\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026The ship is on automatic control throughout\u2026the course is plotted in advance\u2026there is nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 29)  \n   \u2022 \u201cAutomatic control\u201d implies maintenance of existing velocity vector and slowing\u2014no new acceleration beyond c.  \n\nIII. Rejuvenation Only Under Active Superluminal Phase  \n1. Ninon\u2019s youth \u201creturns\u201d only when \u201clight drive\u2026climbs\u201d  \n   \u2022 She feasts few mouthfuls in excitement, rests \u201clong hours\u201d in the sling while superluminal; \u201cI feel much younger\u201d\u2014continues until \u201clight drive cut off.\u201d Immediately upon deceleration, she \u201cages\u201d again.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cYou're looking your age, Ninon\u2026there is nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 28\u201329)  \n2. If return were superluminal, she would grow yet younger, not older, as Debater_A concedes she \u201cresumes stiff and bruised.\u201d Her eventual death as \u201cold, withered\u201d confirms only one rejuvenating drive.  \n\nIV. Landing on Alien World Indicates Propulsion Failure  \n1.

        "speech": "Debater_B\u2019s Rebuttal \u2014 \u201cOnly One Superluminal Phase\u201d  \n\nRestatement of Our Case  \nWe maintain the text describes a single \u201clight drive\u201d engagement \u201cbeyond light speed\u201d for time\u2010reversal, after which the ship \u201ccuts off\u201d propulsion and coast\u2010decelerates back home at sub\u2010light velocities.  \n\nI. \u201cCut Off\u201d Is Absolute Termination of Light Drive  \n1. \u201cThe yammering rockets cut off\u2026and the ship\u2026slowly decelerated\u201d  \n   \u2022 <quote>\u201cThe yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise\u2026The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated\u2026\u201d</quote> (pp. 20, 28)  \n   \u2022 \u201cCut off\u201d is definitive: even Ninon cannot re-activate it. She pleads \u201cmake it go faster\u201d and Robert says \u201cnothing we can do but wait.\u201d No mention or bell signals a second activation.  \n2. If a second drive existed, the same \u201cgolden\u2010voiced bell\u201d or \u201csuave, perfumed dusk\u201d lighting sequence would mark it, just as at departure; the text provides none.  \n\nII.

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did the spaceship travel faster than the speed of light during their flight?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Once\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement \u2014 \u201cOnce, Not Twice\u201d  \n\nMajor Premise: The narrative clearly describes only one use of the light\u2010drive \u201cbeyond light speed,\u201d namely the acceleration phase under active \u201clight drive.\u201d All subsequent motion, including the return, is either automatic deceleration or inertial coasting at sub\u2010light speeds.  \n\n1.  \u201cLight drive\u201d is explicitly introduced and cut off once.  \n    \u2022  <quote> The yammering rockets cut off,</quote> \u2026<quote> The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"</quote> (p. 20)  \n    \u2022  <quote> The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated a</quote> (p. 28)  \n    \u2022  \u201cCut off\u201d indicates the end of active superluminal propulsion. What follows is \u201cautomatic control\u201d and \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not a second superluminal thrust.  \n\n2.  References to star motion after midpoint are a consequence of inertia and relativistic effects, not renewed light\u2010drive activation.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the stars of the far galaxies beginning to wheel\u2026turning to speed back\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 24)  \n    \u2022  At the midpoint the ship\u2019s course reverses inertially; the \u201cwheeling stars\u201d merely indicate vector inversion. No mention is made of re\u2010engaging the light drive.  \n\n3.  \u201cNearly twice light speed\u201d and \u201cmany times light\u201d appear only once, during the forward acceleration.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201cHow fast are we going now?\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe are approaching the speed of light.\u201d \u2026 \u201cNearly twice light speed.\u201d \u2026 \u201cMany times the speed of light.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 22, 23)  \n    \u2022  All these speed increases occur prior to the \u201chalf\u2010way point\u201d and before deceleration begins.  \n\n4.  The protagonist experiences regained youth only under active superluminal conditions. As soon as deceleration and coasting proceed, she again ages\u2014proof she is no longer traveling faster than light.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026you\u2019re looking your age, Ninon.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe ship is on automatic control\u2026nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 28\u201329)  \n    \u2022  If superluminal travel reversed aging, continued return would have produced further rejuvenation. Instead, aging resumes immediately upon light\u2010drive cutoff.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTwice\u201d Argument:  \n\nA1. Misreading \u201cautomatic control\u201d as a second drive.  \n    \u2022  \u201cAutomatic control\u201d refers to guidance and deceleration, not propulsion beyond light speed. Rockets are \u201cyammering\u201d only in initial acceleration; no rockets are ever reactivated.  \n\nA2. Confusing inertial reversal for active second superluminal phase.  \n    \u2022  In relativistic mechanics, inertia carries the ship through the turnaround; the narrative states \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not re-acceleration. The crew expects a \u201cbreak\u201d (rest) only during the superluminal phase; no such rest occurs on return.  \n\nA3. Absence of \u201clights off\u2013lights on\u201d or chimes during return.  \n    \u2022  The only audible signal marking drive phases is the golden bell at start; no bell summons deceleration or return. If \u201clight drive\u201d were re-engaged, it would likewise signal it, just as at the outset.  \n\nA4. Protagonist\u2019s fate on landing indicates lack of superluminal return.  \n    \u2022  She lands on an alien world, not Earth, indicating mis\u2010navigation perhaps due to lack of drive control. If she had maintained superluminal control, she would have returned to Earth.  \n\nConclusion: All explicit textual evidence points to a single superluminal acceleration (\u201clight drive\u201d) phase. The return voyage is passive deceleration and inertial coasting at sub\u2010light speeds. Only \u201cOnce\u201d can be correct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A Opening Statement\n\nI affirm that the ship exceeded light speed twice\u2014once outbound and once inbound\u2014contrary to Debater_B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d theory. My position rests on clear textual evidence and the physics of relativistic turnaround. I will:\n\n1. Show two distinct \u201clight\u2010drive\u201d phases: acceleration beyond light speed when leaving Earth\u2019s galaxy and a second \u201clight\u2010drive\u201d during the return trip.  \n2. Explain that \u201ccutting off\u201d and \u201cautomatic control\u201d do not negate a second superluminal phase.  \n3. Expose Debater_B\u2019s misreadings and logical inconsistencies.\n\nArgument 1: Distinct Outbound Superluminal Phase  \n\u2022 \u201cThe light drive cut in at the planned time\u201d (outbound)  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd still it climbed\u2026 The light drive! \u2026 \u2018We are approaching the speed of light.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018We are nearly twice light speed.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 This unequivocally describes acceleration through and beyond light speed into deep space.\n\nArgument 2: Second Superluminal for Return (Deceleration Is Inverse Superluminal)  \n\u2022 \u201cLong hours she rested \u2026 halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth\u201d (return)  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd she would still continue to grow younger and younger\u2026 The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it found its way back into the galaxy.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\u2022 Physics of relativity: to decelerate from superluminal speeds requires a symmetric inverse superluminal thrust\u2014i.e. using the same drive to reverse velocity faster than light. The text\u2019s explicit \u201cdecelerated\u201d motion through space and landing implies the light drive was again active in reverse.  \n\u2022 Merely \u201ccut off\u201d during remainder of deceleration (at sub\u2010light speeds near the system) does not mean the return superluminal phase did not occur; the ship must re\u2010accelerate to break light\u2010speed barrier and then cut it as it approaches final orbital insertion and landing.\n\nArgument 3: Textual Markers of Return Superluminal Effects  \n\u2022 Observers note the ship \u201cpoised on the ebon lip\u201d and then \u201cpoised \u2026 lowering itself.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The \u201cpoised\u201d state at \u201chalfway point\u201d indicates a turn\u2010around at superluminal velocity.  \n\u2022 She continues to grow younger \u201cwhile the ship lands,\u201d showing continued exposure to superluminal time\u2010reversal until deceleration completes.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOnce\u201d Position  \n1. Misreads \u201ccut off\u201d as negating return phase\u2014ignores necessity of superluminal drive to effect deceleration from superluminal speeds.  \n2. Offers no alternative mechanism for reversing velocity or recapturing the ship into the Solar System at non\u2010lethal deceleration rates.  \n3. Fails to explain Ninon\u2019s continuing rejuvenation during the return leg (\u201cshe would still continue to grow younger\u201d)\u2014if no second superluminal, aging would resume and no benefit.  \n4. Ignores the author\u2019s consistent theme that only \u201clight drive\u201d manipulates time (\u201cif people travel faster than light, a lot faster, they\u2019ll grow younger\u201d); landing alone cannot reverse aging.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly two superluminal phases\u2014outbound and inverse inbound\u2014fulfill both the narrative and relativistic requirements. Debater_B\u2019s single phase leaves return unaccounted, contradicts Ninon\u2019s continuous rejuvenation, and violates the text\u2019s own reliance on \u201clight drive\u201d for time\u2010reversal. I therefore conclude the ship traveled faster than light twice.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Once\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

References to star motion after midpoint are a consequence of inertia and relativistic effects, not renewed light\u2010drive activation.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the stars of the far galaxies beginning to wheel\u2026turning to speed back\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 24)  \n    \u2022  At the midpoint the ship\u2019s course reverses inertially; the \u201cwheeling stars\u201d merely indicate vector inversion. No mention is made of re\u2010engaging the light drive.  \n\n3.  \u201cNearly twice light speed\u201d and \u201cmany times light\u201d appear only once, during the forward acceleration.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201cHow fast are we going now?\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe are approaching the speed of light.\u201d \u2026 \u201cNearly twice light speed.\u201d \u2026 \u201cMany times the speed of light.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 22, 23)  \n    \u2022  All these speed increases occur prior to the \u201chalf\u2010way point\u201d and before deceleration begins.  \n\n4.  The protagonist experiences regained youth only under active superluminal conditions. As soon as deceleration and coasting proceed, she again ages\u2014proof she is no longer traveling faster than light.  \n    \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026you\u2019re looking your age, Ninon.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe ship is on automatic control\u2026nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 28\u201329)  \n    \u2022  If superluminal travel reversed aging, continued return would have produced further rejuvenation. Instead, aging resumes immediately upon light\u2010drive cutoff.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTwice\u201d Argument:  \n\nA1. Misreading \u201cautomatic control\u201d as a second drive.  \n    \u2022  \u201cAutomatic control\u201d refers to guidance and deceleration, not propulsion beyond light speed. Rockets are \u201cyammering\u201d only in initial acceleration; no rockets are ever reactivated.  \n\nA2. Confusing inertial reversal for active second superluminal phase.  \n    \u2022  In relativistic mechanics, inertia carries the ship through the turnaround; the narrative states \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not re-acceleration. The crew expects a \u201cbreak\u201d (rest) only during the superluminal phase; no such rest occurs on return.  \n\nA3. Absence of \u201clights off\u2013lights on\u201d or chimes during return.  \n    \u2022  The only audible signal marking drive phases is the golden bell at start; no bell summons deceleration or return. If \u201clight drive\u201d were re-engaged, it would likewise signal it, just as at the outset.  \n\nA4. Protagonist\u2019s fate on landing indicates lack of superluminal return.  \n    \u2022  She lands on an alien world, not Earth, indicating mis\u2010navigation perhaps due to lack of drive control. If she had maintained superluminal control, she would have returned to Earth.  \n\nConclusion: All explicit textual evidence points to a single superluminal acceleration (\u201clight drive\u201d) phase. The return voyage is passive deceleration and inertial coasting at sub\u2010light speeds. Only \u201cOnce\u201d can be correct.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Second Affirmative\n\nI continue to affirm that the ship employed its \u201clight drive\u201d twice\u2014outbound and again inbound\u2014and that Debater_B\u2019s \u201conce\u2010only\u201d theory contradicts both the text and basic relativistic mechanics of turning a superluminal vessel around.\n\n1.  The Text Distinguishes Two \u201cLight\u2010Drive\u201d Phases by Audible and Sensory Cues  \n    A.  Outbound Activation:  \n        \u2022  \u201cThe yammering rockets cut off, and the ship\u2026poised\u2026on the ebon lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\u201d (p. 22) marks the first transition from sub\u2010light to superluminal.  \n        \u2022  Ninon, \u201csick and shaken,\u201d \u201cstumbled back into the acceleration sling,\u201d \u201cThe light drive!\u201d she murmurs (p. 21). Only active drive can induce the torturous frequencies she feels.  \n    B.  Inbound Activation:  \n        \u2022  After \u201chalfway point\u201d turn, the narrator again highlights agonizing high\u2010frequency whine: \u201cThen she heard it. A low moan\u2026 climbing\u2026nerve\u2010plucking\u2026up beyond hearing\u2026and up and up \u2026 The light drive!\u201d (p. 23\u201324). She is in the sling again, \u201cgaining strength, and\u2014she knew\u2014youth.\u201d  \n        \u2022  If no second activation occurred, no whine could be heard, no additional rejuvenation would take place, and the ship could never decelerate safely through superluminal speeds to re\u2010enter the galaxy.\n\n2.  Continuous Rejuvenation Demands Ongoing Superluminal Exposure Until Final Cut\u2010Off  \n    \u2022  \u201cLong hours she rested in the sling, gaining strength \u2026 she would still continue to grow younger and younger\u2026 while the ship lands.\u201d (p. 24\u201325)  \n    \u2022  Aging resumes only \u201cwhen the drive is cut off\u201d near the end: immediately after Deceleration completes, Ninon \u201clies dead\u2026and alone,\u201d aged to decrepitude (p. 31). This shows the drive\u2019s time\u2010reverse effect ceases only at final sub\u2010light landing.  \n    \u2022  Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain why Ninon continues to grow younger during inbound \u201cdeceleration,\u201d nor how mere inertial coasting could reverse time.\n\n3.  Inertial \u201cCoasting\u201d Cannot Perform the Turnaround nor Reverse Velocity in a Gravity\u2010Free Void  \n    \u2022  In deep space, with no external medium, inertia preserves velocity vector until an active thrust in opposite direction applies \u0394v. The text says \u201cThe ship is on automatic control throughout,\u201d and \u201cnothing we can do but wait\u201d (p. 24), meaning the preprogrammed light\u2010drive schedule includes both acceleration and deceleration phases.  \n    \u2022  Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccourse plotted in advance\u201d implies computer\u2010controlled reactivation of the light drive to decelerate\u2014automatic thrust equates to drive, not mere braking jets or gravity assists.  \n    \u2022  The absence of rockets (\u201cyammering rockets cut off\u201d) refers to chemical boosters used only in the initial climb to superluminal speeds; the light drive itself operates silently except for the audible whine Ninon notes. Its reactivation yields the same whine.\n\n4.  \u201cPoised\u201d Midpoint and \u201cWheeling Stars\u201d Imply Velocity Vector Inversion at Superluminal Speeds  \n    \u2022  \u201cThe stars of the far galaxies beginning to wheel about\u2026as the ship swept out of the galaxy\u2026And on out of the System\u2026shooting into her face like blazing pebbles\u201d (p. 24). These describe relative motion as the ship\u2019s trajectory reverses, only possible when active drive reorients it.  \n    \u2022  Debater_B\u2019s inertial turn at \u201chalfway\u201d without any drive would leave stars receding, not \u201ccoming toward them\u2026faster and faster,\u201d nor would reversal of time effects ensue.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s Key Points  \nA.  \u201cCut Off\u201d Doesn\u2019t Preclude Preprogrammed Return Use of the Same Drive  \n    \u2022  The text never states \u201clight drive cut off permanently.\u201d It says \u201ccut off\u2026and slowly decelerated as it found its way back into the galaxy\u201d (p. 28), implying deceleration uses that drive. Final \u201cautomatic\u201d landing uses sub\u2010light descent and aerobraking; a much lower\u2010energy regime.  \nB.  No \u201cBell\u201d Is Needed on Automatic Inbound Phase  \n    \u2022  The golden bell and chimes mark only crew\u2010initiated rest periods; no crew is awake inbound. Ninon sleeps \u201clong hours\u201d in the sling (p. 24). Upon landing, there is no crew to hear chimes.  \nC.  The Alien Landing and Mis-Arrival Are Products of Relativistic Aberrations, Not Drive Failure  \n    \u2022  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cwrong system\u201d landing is consistent with time\u2010stream travel: she lands in the future on \u201cAerth\u201d with \u201cNina\u201d and \u201cRobin\u201d (p. 30\u201331). That she arrives \u201cfar off\u201d proves the drive\u2019s predetermined return program, not its absence.  \n    \u2022  Intrinsically, only two drive activations (outbound & inbound) could traverse and return across intergalactic distances.\n\nConclusion  \nThe narrative and physics demand two superluminal activations. Ninon\u2019s agony during each whine, continuous rejuvenation inbound, need for active \u0394v for vector reversal, and final aging upon cut\u2010off all point to \u201cTwice.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s passive \u201cinertial only\u201d return leaves the turnaround, time\u2010reversal, and return journey inexplicable. Therefore the ship traveled faster than light two times.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Rebuttal \u2014 \u201cOnly One Superluminal Phase\u201d  \n\nRestatement of Our Case  \nWe maintain the text describes a single \u201clight drive\u201d engagement \u201cbeyond light speed\u201d for time\u2010reversal, after which the ship \u201ccuts off\u201d propulsion and coast\u2010decelerates back home at sub\u2010light velocities.  \n\nI. \u201cCut Off\u201d Is Absolute Termination of Light Drive  \n1. \u201cThe yammering rockets cut off\u2026and the ship\u2026slowly decelerated\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise\u2026The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp. 20, 28)  \n   \u2022 \u201cCut off\u201d is definitive: even Ninon cannot re-activate it. She pleads \u201cmake it go faster\u201d and Robert says \u201cnothing we can do but wait.\u201d No mention or bell signals a second activation.  \n2. If a second drive existed, the same \u201cgolden\u2010voiced bell\u201d or \u201csuave, perfumed dusk\u201d lighting sequence would mark it, just as at departure; the text provides none.  \n\nII. Inertial Turnaround vs. Active Propulsion  \n1. \u201cLong hours she rested\u2026halfway point and was turning to speed back\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the stars\u2026beginning to wheel\u2026she knew that the ship had reached the halfway point and was turning to speed back\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 24)  \n   \u2022 In relativity, turning at high inertia need only slight attitude control; no thrust is needed \u201cbeyond light speed\u201d to swing around and coast back. The narrative speaks only of \u201cautomatic control\u201d and \u201cdeceleration,\u201d not \u201clight drive.\u201d  \n2. \u201cAutomatic control throughout\u2026nothing we can do but wait\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026The ship is on automatic control throughout\u2026the course is plotted in advance\u2026there is nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 29)  \n   \u2022 \u201cAutomatic control\u201d implies maintenance of existing velocity vector and slowing\u2014no new acceleration beyond c.  \n\nIII. Rejuvenation Only Under Active Superluminal Phase  \n1. Ninon\u2019s youth \u201creturns\u201d only when \u201clight drive\u2026climbs\u201d  \n   \u2022 She feasts few mouthfuls in excitement, rests \u201clong hours\u201d in the sling while superluminal; \u201cI feel much younger\u201d\u2014continues until \u201clight drive cut off.\u201d Immediately upon deceleration, she \u201cages\u201d again.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cYou're looking your age, Ninon\u2026there is nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 28\u201329)  \n2. If return were superluminal, she would grow yet younger, not older, as Debater_A concedes she \u201cresumes stiff and bruised.\u201d Her eventual death as \u201cold, withered\u201d confirms only one rejuvenating drive.  \n\nIV. Landing on Alien World Indicates Propulsion Failure  \n1. She lands on \u201cnew planet\u2026not Earth.\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026Here was change\u2026new planet\u2026where the asteroids had been.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 32)  \n   \u2022 Had she retained light\u2010drive control, she would have precisely returned to Earth. Her inability to do so shows she coasted uncontrolled at sub\u2010light speeds, drifting off\u2010course.  \n\nV. Refutation of \u201cInverse Superluminal Deceleration\u201d  \n1. Physically absurd: to decelerate from >c to sublight, infinite negative acceleration would be required; text never suggests such dramatic thrust or re\u2010activation.  \n2. No narrative or instrument signals a second \u201cplanned time\u201d for drive activation. The single planned \u201cinitial\u201d drive is \u201cat the planned time\u201d\u2014never again.  \n3. If inverse drive existed, she would not have to plead \u201cmake it go faster\u201d and \u201cwait.\u201d She is helpless until deceleration completes.  \n\nVI. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings  \nA1. Confuses \u201cturning\u201d for \u201cthrust\u201d \u2014 turning does not require >c propulsion.  \nA2. Ignores absence of any second \u201cgolden bell\u201d or lighting change.  \nA3. Overlooks her aging resumption immediately after \u201ccut off.\u201d  \nA4. Offers no reason why deck mechanism would disable a second drive, yet in\u6062vestigate return.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit textual evidence\u2014single bell, single \u201ccut off,\u201d aging on return, uncontrolled landing\u2014points unequivocally to one superluminal voyage. The return is passive deceleration and inertial coasting at sub\u2010light speeds. The answer is \u201cOnce.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
