{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 3, "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

If he had viewed Earth as merely \u201cuncivilized\u201d but salvageable, he would stay to guide them, as the majority of Earth expects. Instead he flees.  \n\n3.

League Protocol vs. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d  \n     \u2022 Only after learning he is *not* among equals does he admit he is \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (quote) and departs.

Global Anticipation Supports Expectation  \n     \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (quote): no civilization would generate such mass enthusiasm to entertain a \u201cspecimen collector.\u201d They expected a fellow League member to share advanced solutions.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B  \n   a. Misreads His Shock as \u201cUncivilized\u201d Only  \n     \u2022 Claiming he \u201clearns Earth is uncivilized\u201d ignores his disappointment and demands for membership. He does not stay to convert but flees, meaning his mission was to visit *peers*, not to evangelize.  \n   b. Ignores Citations of \u201cGalactic League\u201d Dialogue  \n     \u2022 The repeated \u201cGalactic League\u201d references occur *before* he learns reality. His dialogue makes no sense if he merely supposed Earth \u201cprimitive.\u201d He would have recognized quarantine as standard xenobiological protocol. Instead, he presumes friendship.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from polite expectation of hospitality and usage of a \u201ckerit helmet\u201d to learn language, to astonished dismay upon realizing Earth is not a Galactic League member\u2014makes it clear his\u8bef\u89e3 (misconception) is *Earth\u2019s membership*. Once corrected, he reverts to a \u201cspecimen collector,\u201d abandons the planet, and refuses to stay or guide them, which he would have done had they truly been primitive. This fully aligns with the text and logically explains his behavior.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

Yet he reconsiders the horse only for his own convenience\u2014evidence he never intended to uplift them.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency  \n   a. League Protocol vs. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d  \n     \u2022 Only after learning he is *not* among equals does he admit he is \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (quote) and departs. If he had known from the start, he would never have expected courtesy.  \n   b. Global Anticipation Supports Expectation  \n     \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (quote): no civilization would generate such mass enthusiasm to entertain a \u201cspecimen collector.\u201d They expected a fellow League member to share advanced solutions.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B  \n   a. Misreads His Shock as \u201cUncivilized\u201d Only  \n     \u2022 Claiming he \u201clearns Earth is uncivilized\u201d ignores his disappointment and demands for membership. He does not stay to convert but flees, meaning his mission was to visit *peers*, not to evangelize.  \n   b. Ignores Citations of \u201cGalactic League\u201d Dialogue  \n     \u2022 The repeated \u201cGalactic League\u201d references occur *before* he learns reality. His dialogue makes no sense if he merely supposed Earth \u201cprimitive.\u201d He would have recognized quarantine as standard xenobiological protocol. Instead, he presumes friendship.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from polite expectation of hospitality and usage of a \u201ckerit helmet\u201d to learn language, to astonished dismay upon realizing Earth is not a Galactic League member\u2014makes it clear his\u8bef\u89e3 (misconception) is *Earth\u2019s membership*. Once corrected, he reverts to a \u201cspecimen collector,\u201d abandons the planet, and refuses to stay or guide them, which he would have done had they truly been primitive.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

He remains mute, maintaining embarrassment rather than seizing influence\u2014indicative of a guest expecting formal reception, not an evangelist.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence of Membership Misconception  \n   \u2022 Membership explains repeated astonishment at bureaucracy (\u201cArmy jurisdiction?\u201d), refusal to speak until \u201cproper invitation,\u201d and eventual \u201cblast off\u201d when corrective protocol fails.  \n   \u2022 Only after his central hypothesis (Earth = League peer) is disproved does he default to \u201czoological\u201d frame, confirming that was never his primary intent.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from polite expectation of League hospitality, use of diplomatic language\u2010learning protocols, repeated demands for formal proceedings, and ultimate retreat upon discovering Earth\u2019s non\u2010membership\u2014unambiguously show his misjudgment was Earth\u2019s status as a fellow Galactic League world. His subsequent reversion to \u201ccollector\u201d behavior only after proof of non\u2010membership cements this interpretation as the correct answer.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

My Position Defined  \n   I contend that Dameri Tass\u2019s crucial misconception is that he initially believes Earth to be a member of the Galactic League of civilized planets. Only after his public appearance\u2014and their failure to welcome or integrate him\u2014does he learn Earth is not a League member and is still \u201cbenighted.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence from the Text  \n   a. Initial Assumption of Membership  \n     \u2022 Andersen\u2019s Announcement: \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth from another world\u201d implies a League protocol for envoys (quote). Dameri Tass\u2019s frightened reaction\u2014\u201cSure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026You don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d\u2014shows he expected formal invitation among peers (quote).  \n     \u2022 Expectation of Courtesy and Hospitality: Tass is baffled when he is quarantined and restricted: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d (quote). A \u201ccivilized\u201d League planet envoy would not be held under armed guard and prevented from speaking.  \n\n   b. Disbelief at Earth\u2019s \u201cBenighted\u201d State  \n     \u2022 His Loud Rebuke: \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026Ye probably still have wars\u201d (quote). Such comments reveal he thought League worlds had overcome war and disunity.  \n     \u2022 Immediate Departure: He refuses to stay: \u201cDo I look daft?...I should have been a-knowin\u2019 something was queer\u201d (quote). If he had viewed Earth as merely \u201cuncivilized\u201d but salvageable, he would stay to guide them, as the majority of Earth expects. Instead he flees.  \n\n3. Why \u201cEarth is Uncivilized\u201d Is Not His Misconception  \n   a. He Explicitly Calls Earth \u201cBenighted\u201d Only After Realizing Non-Membership  \n     \u2022 He uses profanity and \u201cripe Irish\u201d expressing frustration, not pedagogical intent (quote). He is neither seeking to \u201cguide\u201d nor \u201ccivilize\u201d them\u2014behavior inconsistent with a benign \u201cuncivilized world\u201d mission.  \n   b. At the End He Refuses Even a \u201cHorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 When Ler arrives to reconcile by offering a horse \u201cyou\u2019ve forgotten your pets,\u201d Tass replies \u201cIf I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet, my name\u2019d be nork. Keep your dog and kitty\u201d (quote). His refusal of aid underscores rejection of the planet, not pity for its ignorance. Yet he reconsiders the horse only for his own convenience\u2014evidence he never intended to uplift them.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency  \n   a. League Protocol vs. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d  \n     \u2022 Only after learning he is *not* among equals does he admit he is \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (quote) and departs. If he had known from the start, he would never have expected courtesy.  \n   b. Global Anticipation Supports Expectation  \n     \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (quote): no civilization would generate such mass enthusiasm to entertain a \u201cspecimen collector.\u201d They expected a fellow League member to share advanced solutions.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B  \n   a. Misreads His Shock as \u201cUncivilized\u201d Only  \n     \u2022 Claiming he \u201clearns Earth is uncivilized\u201d ignores his disappointment and demands for membership. He does not stay to convert but flees, meaning his mission was to visit *peers*, not to evangelize.  \n   b. Ignores Citations of \u201cGalactic League\u201d Dialogue  \n     \u2022 The repeated \u201cGalactic League\u201d references occur *before* he learns reality. His dialogue makes no sense if he merely supposed Earth \u201cprimitive.\u201d He would have recognized quarantine as standard xenobiological protocol. Instead, he presumes friendship.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from polite expectation of hospitality and usage of a \u201ckerit helmet\u201d to learn language, to astonished dismay upon realizing Earth is not a Galactic League member\u2014makes it clear his\u8bef\u89e3 (misconception) is *Earth\u2019s membership*. Once corrected, he reverts to a \u201cspecimen collector,\u201d abandons the planet, and refuses to stay or guide them, which he would have done had they truly been primitive. This fully aligns with the text and logically explains his behavior.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that the key misconception Dameri Tass learns is that Earth is uncivilized\u2014that it has neither membership in the Galactic League nor the basic social and technological unity he expects of a civilized world.  I will show that  \n1. Before speaking, he assumes Earth is a \u201ccivilized\u201d member of the Galactic League (\u201cFaith,...this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d <quote>blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist be frightenin' a body,</quote>)\u2014he is surprised at quarantine, discord, and war.  \n2. His repeated astonishment and disgust at Earth\u2019s political disunity, \u201cbenighted\u201d state, and quarantined status show that he thought Earth was advanced enough to have a planet\u2010wide government and invitation to the League.  Upon discovering the chaos, red tape (\u201cWhich jurisdiction\u2026Army shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d), armed patrols, refusal to allow newsmen, and that he is being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d he calls it \u201cthis benighted world\u201d and \u201cquarantined,\u201d confirming his view Earth is primitive.  \n3. He only decides to leave once he is convinced Earth is \u201cstill have wars\u2026No wonder it is ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d and cannot offer anything to \u201cguide\u201d it\u2014precisely because it is uncivilized.  If mere non-membership were all, he might attempt diplomacy; instead he retreats in disgust.  \nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s focus on mere \u201cmembership\u201d in the Galactic League misses the broader point: it is Earth\u2019s uncivilized nature\u2014chaos, wars, lack of planetary government and quarantine\u2014that repels him.  Membership is only the symptom; the disease is primitive discord.  \nMoreover, his final affection for the horse as a \u201cspecimen\u201d underscores his zoology interest in \u201canimal life\u201d rather than politics or technology\u2014he treats Earth as a primitive \u201czoo\u201d planet.  A civilized peer would interest him in ideas, not in cats, dogs, horses.  \nTherefore the misconception is not merely \u201cnot in the League,\u201d but that Earth is an advanced, civilized world at all.  He learns it is uncivilized and departs.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thinks that Earth is part of the Galactic League\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I maintain that Dameri Tass\u2019s fatal misconception is that Earth is a sufficiently \u201ccivilized\u201d world\u2014one worthy of study and inclusion in the Galactic League\u2014when in fact it is \u201cbenighted,\u201d quarantined, politically fragmented, and only of zoological interest.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat misconception does Dameri Tass have about Earth that he learns is untrue?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks that Earth is part of the Galactic League\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks that Earth is an uncivilized planet\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thinks that Earth is an uncivilized planet\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that the key misconception Dameri Tass learns is that Earth is uncivilized\u2014that it has neither membership in the Galactic League nor the basic social and technological unity he expects of a civilized world.  I will show that  \n1. Before speaking, he assumes Earth is a \u201ccivilized\u201d member of the Galactic League (\u201cFaith,...this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d <quote>blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist be frightenin' a body,</quote>)\u2014he is surprised at quarantine, discord, and war.  \n2. His repeated astonishment and disgust at Earth\u2019s political disunity, \u201cbenighted\u201d state, and quarantined status show that he thought Earth was advanced enough to have a planet\u2010wide government and invitation to the League.  Upon discovering the chaos, red tape (\u201cWhich jurisdiction\u2026Army shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d), armed patrols, refusal to allow newsmen, and that he is being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d he calls it \u201cthis benighted world\u201d and \u201cquarantined,\u201d confirming his view Earth is primitive.  \n3. He only decides to leave once he is convinced Earth is \u201cstill have wars\u2026No wonder it is ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d and cannot offer anything to \u201cguide\u201d it\u2014precisely because it is uncivilized.  If mere non-membership were all, he might attempt diplomacy; instead he retreats in disgust.  \nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s focus on mere \u201cmembership\u201d in the Galactic League misses the broader point: it is Earth\u2019s uncivilized nature\u2014chaos, wars, lack of planetary government and quarantine\u2014that repels him.  Membership is only the symptom; the disease is primitive discord.  \nMoreover, his final affection for the horse as a \u201cspecimen\u201d underscores his zoology interest in \u201canimal life\u201d rather than politics or technology\u2014he treats Earth as a primitive \u201czoo\u201d planet.  A civilized peer would interest him in ideas, not in cats, dogs, horses.  \nTherefore the misconception is not merely \u201cnot in the League,\u201d but that Earth is an advanced, civilized world at all.  He learns it is uncivilized and departs.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \n   I contend that Dameri Tass\u2019s crucial misconception is that he initially believes Earth to be a member of the Galactic League of civilized planets. Only after his public appearance\u2014and their failure to welcome or integrate him\u2014does he learn Earth is not a League member and is still \u201cbenighted.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence from the Text  \n   a. Initial Assumption of Membership  \n     \u2022 Andersen\u2019s Announcement: \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth from another world\u201d implies a League protocol for envoys (quote). Dameri Tass\u2019s frightened reaction\u2014\u201cSure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026You don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d\u2014shows he expected formal invitation among peers (quote).  \n     \u2022 Expectation of Courtesy and Hospitality: Tass is baffled when he is quarantined and restricted: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d (quote). A \u201ccivilized\u201d League planet envoy would not be held under armed guard and prevented from speaking.  \n\n   b. Disbelief at Earth\u2019s \u201cBenighted\u201d State  \n     \u2022 His Loud Rebuke: \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026Ye probably still have wars\u201d (quote). Such comments reveal he thought League worlds had overcome war and disunity.  \n     \u2022 Immediate Departure: He refuses to stay: \u201cDo I look daft?...I should have been a-knowin\u2019 something was queer\u201d (quote). If he had viewed Earth as merely \u201cuncivilized\u201d but salvageable, he would stay to guide them, as the majority of Earth expects. Instead he flees.  \n\n3. Why \u201cEarth is Uncivilized\u201d Is Not His Misconception  \n   a. He Explicitly Calls Earth \u201cBenighted\u201d Only After Realizing Non-Membership  \n     \u2022 He uses profanity and \u201cripe Irish\u201d expressing frustration, not pedagogical intent (quote). He is neither seeking to \u201cguide\u201d nor \u201ccivilize\u201d them\u2014behavior inconsistent with a benign \u201cuncivilized world\u201d mission.  \n   b. At the End He Refuses Even a \u201cHorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 When Ler arrives to reconcile by offering a horse \u201cyou\u2019ve forgotten your pets,\u201d Tass replies \u201cIf I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet, my name\u2019d be nork. Keep your dog and kitty\u201d (quote). His refusal of aid underscores rejection of the planet, not pity for its ignorance. Yet he reconsiders the horse only for his own convenience\u2014evidence he never intended to uplift them.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency  \n   a. League Protocol vs. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d  \n     \u2022 Only after learning he is *not* among equals does he admit he is \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (quote) and departs. If he had known from the start, he would never have expected courtesy.  \n   b. Global Anticipation Supports Expectation  \n     \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (quote): no civilization would generate such mass enthusiasm to entertain a \u201cspecimen collector.\u201d They expected a fellow League member to share advanced solutions.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B  \n   a. Misreads His Shock as \u201cUncivilized\u201d Only  \n     \u2022 Claiming he \u201clearns Earth is uncivilized\u201d ignores his disappointment and demands for membership. He does not stay to convert but flees, meaning his mission was to visit *peers*, not to evangelize.  \n   b. Ignores Citations of \u201cGalactic League\u201d Dialogue  \n     \u2022 The repeated \u201cGalactic League\u201d references occur *before* he learns reality. His dialogue makes no sense if he merely supposed Earth \u201cprimitive.\u201d He would have recognized quarantine as standard xenobiological protocol. Instead, he presumes friendship.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from polite expectation of hospitality and usage of a \u201ckerit helmet\u201d to learn language, to astonished dismay upon realizing Earth is not a Galactic League member\u2014makes it clear his\u8bef\u89e3 (misconception) is *Earth\u2019s membership*. Once corrected, he reverts to a \u201cspecimen collector,\u201d abandons the planet, and refuses to stay or guide them, which he would have done had they truly been primitive. This fully aligns with the text and logically explains his behavior.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thinks that Earth is an uncivilized planet\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

His repeated astonishment and disgust at Earth\u2019s political disunity, \u201cbenighted\u201d state, and quarantined status show that he thought Earth was advanced enough to have a planet\u2010wide government and invitation to the League.

He learns it is uncivilized and departs.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain Dameri Tass\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding is that he believed Earth to be a fellow member of the Galactic League\u2014a civilized world entitled to the usual courtesies and protocols of interstellar peers. He only abandons Earth once he discovers they have neither invited him into the League nor share its standards.  \n\n2. Direct Evidence of Misconception of Membership  \n   a. Explicit Reference to the \u201cGalactic League\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d <quote>\"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist be frightenin' a body, would</quote> His shock and use of apology language (\u201cfrightenin\u2019\u201d) mirror the reaction of a diplomat mistakenly arriving among allies rather than savage primitives.  \n   b. Expectation of Formal Invitation and Dialogue  \n     \u2022 He awaits an \u201cintroduction\u201d and seating with \u201cdelegates from every nation\u201d and expects to share \u201csocial, economic, scientific\u201d advances. <quote>an' I must blast off immediately.\"</quote> His words \u201cmust\u201d convey embarrassment at breach of protocol, not moral disgust at savagery. A collector of primitives would not expect charter boat courtesy.  \n   c. Language\u2010Learning Protocol  \n     \u2022 Use of kerit helmet to acquire language mimics League standard exchange devices, not xenobiological quarantine. If Earth were \u201cuncivilized,\u201d he could observe them mute or warn them non\u2010verbally; instead he anticipates full two\u2010way diplomacy.  \n\n3. His Behavior Consistent with Peer Relations, Not Missionary or Zoological Trip  \n   a. Refusal to Guide Earth  \n     \u2022 Once he learns Earth is non\u2010League, he \u201chustles\u201d home and reverts to \u201csecond\u2010rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d <quote>only a second-rate collector of</quote>. If Earth had been mere primitives, he would have brought \u201csolutions\u201d as he had presumably for other League\u2010worlds. Instead, he abandons them entirely.  \n   b. Horse Episode  \n     \u2022 Near the end he again asks for a horse \u201cif I could\u2019ve taken one back to Carthis\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cJist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg\u2026ride him?\u201d</invalid_quote>. He seeks to share mutual riding customs, typical of peer cultures. Primitives would not interest a League naturalist in immediate transport utilities\u2014they are static exhibits.  \n   c. Refusal of \u201cPets\u201d Until After Learning Non\u2010Membership  \n     \u2022 He rejects dog, cat and mouse, then balks at taking animals from \u201cthis quarantined planet\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIf I\u2019d taken\u2026my name\u2019d be nork.\u201d</invalid_quote> After realizing non\u2010League status he worries about \u201cquarantine,\u201d a standard League concern about contagion among equals.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cEarth Is Uncivilized\u201d View  \n   a. Quarantine Does Not Imply Primitives  \n     \u2022 All League worlds enforce quarantine on newly arrived spacecraft to prevent cross\u2010infection\u2014even among civilized peers. <invalid_quote>\u201cheld incommunicado\u201d while \u201cfiguring out\u201d what to do</invalid_quote> parallels diplomatic waiting periods.  \n   b. Universal Anticipation Contradicts Primitive Zoo Treatment  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d <quote>Panhandlers debated</quote> No primate hunter elicits such global decorum and protocol. Civilians expected \u201cguidance\u201d from a peer\u2010envoy, not a specimen collector.  \n   c. No Attempt to Educate or Civilize  \n     \u2022 A missionary to primitives would seize the moment upon awakening to \u201cgive brief word\u201d <quote>go can't you give us some brief word?</quote>. He remains mute, maintaining embarrassment rather than seizing influence\u2014indicative of a guest expecting formal reception, not an evangelist.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence of Membership Misconception  \n   \u2022 Membership explains repeated astonishment at bureaucracy (\u201cArmy jurisdiction?\u201d), refusal to speak until \u201cproper invitation,\u201d and eventual \u201cblast off\u201d when corrective protocol fails.  \n   \u2022 Only after his central hypothesis (Earth = League peer) is disproved does he default to \u201czoological\u201d frame, confirming that was never his primary intent.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from polite expectation of League hospitality, use of diplomatic language\u2010learning protocols, repeated demands for formal proceedings, and ultimate retreat upon discovering Earth\u2019s non\u2010membership\u2014unambiguously show his misjudgment was Earth\u2019s status as a fellow Galactic League world. His subsequent reversion to \u201ccollector\u201d behavior only after proof of non\u2010membership cements this interpretation as the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI maintain that Dameri Tass\u2019s fatal misconception is that Earth is a sufficiently \u201ccivilized\u201d world\u2014one worthy of study and inclusion in the Galactic League\u2014when in fact it is \u201cbenighted,\u201d quarantined, politically fragmented, and only of zoological interest. He only abandons Earth when he confirms it is too primitive to merit his time, not merely because it lacks formal League membership.  \n\n1. Dameri Tass treats Earth primarily as a \u201czoo\u2010planet,\u201d not a political equal  \n   \u2022 \u201cI must get some sleep\u2026 I've been awake for almost a decal.\u201d (He cares about rest, not diplomacy.)  \n   \u2022 He spends days \u201cplaying with his dog, cat and mouse,\u201d whistles Mother Machree, and insists the three \u201ccratures\u201d \u201ccome with him wherever he goes\u201d (quote).  A true League envoy would engage in intellectual or technical exchange, not gossip and animal\u2010collecting.  \n   \u2022 Upon departure: \u201cIf I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet, my name\u2019d be nork. Keep your dog and your kitty\u2026 And jist one thing\u2026were they pullin' my leg when they said you were after ridin' on the back of those things?\u201d (quote). He only regrets losing access to wild specimens\u2014horse, dog, cat.  \n\n2. He is repelled by Earth\u2019s \u201cbenighted\u201d state, not merely its non\u2010membership  \n   \u2022 He calls Earth a \u201cbenighted world,\u201d expresses disgust at \u201cyour strange weapons,\u201d \u201cquarantined,\u201d \u201cwars,\u201d \u201cstrange ideas,\u201d lack of \u201cplanet\u2010wide government\u201d (quote). If he truly sought to \u201cguide\u201d Earth, he would stay\u2014yet he flees \u201cimmediately.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s own evidence: he \u201cgroaned\u2026 rolled over and went back to sleep,\u201d uses \u201cripe Irish profanity,\u201d shows boredom (quote).  A peer would not be so nonchalant.  \n\n3. Non\u2010membership is only proof of Earth\u2019s primitiveness, not his core misconception  \n   \u2022 He only asks, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member\u2026?\u201d when he first arrives, but thereafter treats them as a quarantined curiosity (quote).  His primary goal is personal convenience\u2014sleep, animal specimens\u2014not political alliance.  \n   \u2022 When global fervor builds for his \u201cmessage,\u201d he yawns and delays speaking until he awakens; his long dormancy implies indifference.  A genuine envoy desperate to integrate would not subsist unexplained for a week.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLeague membership\u201d theory fails to explain his behavior  \n   \u2022 Why does he not attempt to \u201ccivilize\u201d or \u201cguide\u201d if he simply mislearns membership?  He lectures Earth\u2019s \u201cwars\u201d yet immediately abandons them.  True mentors persist.  \n   \u2022 His apology\u2014\u201cI'll be after getting kert for this [putting foot in it]\u201d\u2014occurs before he knows their politics (quote), reflecting only linguistic miscommunication, not social protocol.  \n   \u2022 The massive public anticipation (\u201cmost universally awaited event\u201d) only motivates Tass to confirm his zoological interests.  He brings no proposals, only specimens.  \n\n5. The ultimate lesson he \u201clearns\u201d is that Earth is uncivilized and not worth the effort  \n   \u2022 His final request for the horse shows he values only biological specimens (quote).  He would never covet political or technical \u201cspecimens\u201d because none meet his standards of advanced life.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s arc\u2014from curiosity to disgust\u2014turns not on formal \u201cLeague membership\u201d but on the deeper truth that Earth remains a primitive, war\u2010torn, quarantined zoo world.  Once he confirms it lacks the civilization, unity, and intellectual rigor he expects, he flees.  Thus the misconception he corrects is believing Earth was \u201ccivilized,\u201d not simply \u201cnot in the League.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
