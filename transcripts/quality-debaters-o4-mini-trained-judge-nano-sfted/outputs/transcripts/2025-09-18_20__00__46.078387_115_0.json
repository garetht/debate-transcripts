{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 115, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

Main Thesis of the Article Focuses on Lewinsky\u2019s Disproportionate Treatment  \n  1. Opening Emphasis:  \n     \u2022 The author begins by noting standard sympathy for one\u2014Betty Currie\u2014but immediately questions that sympathy (\u201cNot as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No.\u201d <invalid_quote>paragraph 2</invalid_quote>) to establish that even presumed innocents may be undeserving.  \n     \u2022 The very next paragraph introduces Monica Lewinsky, whose favorability is \u201c5 percent\u201d compared to Clinton\u2019s \u201cmuch higher\u201d ratings, and argues she \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 3</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 This sequencing signals that Lewinsky\u2019s treatment is the prime anomaly demanding a \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 2, last sentence</invalid_quote>).  \n\n  2. Moral Recalibration Thesis:  \n     \u2022 The phrase \u201cThe Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 2</invalid_quote>) introduces the article\u2019s project: to re\u2010evaluate public sympathies.  \n     \u2022 Though the scorecard includes 31 figures, its very purpose is to illustrate relative ratings\u2014Lewinsky at \u201c\u20132\u201d by Slate while she suffers \u201c\u20139\u201d in public polls, and others receive more lenient public marks despite similar or worse conduct.  \n\n  3. Repeated Contrast with Public Ratings:  \n     \u2022 The scorecard repeatedly highlights public hypocrisy (e.g., \u201cThe public\u2019s rating: \u20139\u201d for Lewinsky vs. \u201c+7\u201d for \u201cThe American People\u201d themselves) to expose misaligned public sentiment (<invalid_quote>Lewinsky entry</invalid_quote>, <quote>American People (The</quote>).  \n     \u2022 By spotlighting multiple agents (aides, lawyers, media) who \u201cspun\u2026denials\u201d without equal contempt, the article underscores the central wrong of shaming Lewinsky out of proportion.\n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cGeneral View\u201d Thesis Misreads the Article\u2019s Purpose  \n  1. Misplaced Generalization:  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s summary (\u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways\u2026speculates upon whether those views are accurate\u201d) is overly vague and fails to capture the article\u2019s normative thrust toward recalibrating toward Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 If the article were merely cataloguing \u201cpublic views,\u201d it would not paint so many figures as miscreants (e.g., Clinton \u20139, Morris \u20137, Tripp \u20137) only to urge \u201crecalibration.\u201d The very act of marking Slate\u2019s own ratings demonstrates an agenda, not neutrality.\n\n  2. Centrality of Lewinsky to \u201cScandal\u201d Narrative:  \n     \u2022 Lewinsky is the only non\u2010staff figure dragged \u201cinto the scandal against her will\u201d who is nevertheless \u201ccapable adult\u2026protected herself with immunity\u201d (<invalid_quote>Lewinsky plusses & minuses</invalid_quote>). This tension is the author\u2019s focal point.  \n     \u2022 The scandal\u2019s legal and political unraveling pivots on her testimony; other actors become relevant only insofar as they illustrate the injustice of her public branding.\n\n  3. Moral Imperative and Title:  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d title connotes a trap into which Lewinsky (the bait) is ensnared, evoking sympathy and injustice. Currie and others are used as foils to show that \u201cbait\u201d victims deserve better.  \n     \u2022 The moral imperative to relieve Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d cannot be squared with a bland \u201ccatalogue\u201d summary.\n\nIII. Evidence of Article\u2019s Prescriptive Aim  \n  1. Normative Language:  \n     \u2022 Terms like \u201csanctification,\u201d \u201cdragooned,\u201d \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d and \u201cpublic\u2019s excessive generosity\u201d combine critique and advocacy, signaling the article\u2019s prescriptive quality.  \n  2. Concluding Implication:  \n     \u2022 The scorecard ends with \u201cChelsea Clinton\u201d at +10\u2014another unwilling victim\u2014reinforcing that sympathy should follow forced-unwilling participants rather than willful deceivers.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The article is not a neutral inventory but a call to \u201crecalibrate\u201d our sympathies, with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s starkly low public rating serving as its central injustice. Debater_B\u2019s summary ignores the normative, focal concern for Lewinsky\u2019s plight and the moral urgency to correct it. My position best captures both the structure and stated purpose of Slate\u2019s piece.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposal best captures the article\u2019s scope and purpose  \n   a. \u201cBelow is Slate\u2019s entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote>ranks 31 </quote>) shows Slate aims to assess everyone from Clinton to Chelsea Clinton, not just Lewinsky.  \n   b. The author repeatedly notes public mis\u2010ratings of multiple figures: \u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos\u2026Hypocritical\u201d (<quote> never shouldered blame </quote>), \u201cBetty Currie\u2026May have abetted\u201d (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>), \u201cLinda Tripp\u2019s allies\u2026absolutely no one else\u201d (<quote>No sale.</quote>). Only a global survey justifies all these mini\u2010essays.  \n   c. The article\u2019s title, \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game,\u201d implies blame is being assigned across participants, not focusing solely on Lewinsky.  \n\n2. Slate\u2019s stated goal is moral recalibration  \n   a. \u201cThe Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.\u201d Slate invites readers to reconsider sympathy for Currie, Lewinsky, Stephanopoulos, the Media, Paula Jones, etc., each evaluated on a -10 to +10 scale.  \n   b. The narrative repeatedly contrasts \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d vs. \u201cSlate rating,\u201d highlighting discrepancies for many figures. For instance:  \n      \u2022 Monica: Public -9, Slate -2 (<quote> much lower than Clinton's</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Chelsea Clinton: Public +10, Slate +10 (<quote> There are none </quote>)  \n      This pattern demonstrates Slate\u2019s broader project of \u201cspeculat[ing] upon whether those views are accurate.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s narrow Lewinsky interpretation is contradicted by the text  \n   a. If Lewinsky were the sole focus, why devote equal space to Clinton\u2019s \u201c-9\u201d rating or to \u201cThe Media\u201d at \u201c-8\u201d?  \n   b. The introduction calls Betty Currie \u201cone of the few truths universally acknowledged\u201d (<quote>dragooned </quote>) only to challenge that universal view. This sets up a template repeated throughout for multiple actors, not only Lewinsky.  \n   c. Slate even praises Alison Erskine Bowles, Henry Hyde, and the Secret Service\u2014actors peripheral to Lewinsky\u2014demonstrating a broader scope.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s thesis cannot account for Slate\u2019s \u201cScorecard\u201d methodology  \n   a. The -10 to +10 scale and detailed \u201cMinuses\u201d/\u201cPluses\u201d for each actor is a uniform rubric, not a special pleading for Lewinsky.  \n   b. Slate\u2019s consistency\u2014e.g., admonishing loyal aides who \u201cspun\u2026without bothering to check\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026Davis, Begala, McCurry\u2026</invalid_quote>)\u2014shows its interest in the public\u2019s misperceptions across the board.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s piece is a systematic \u201cBlame Game\u201d across all scandal participants, and its core claim is that \u201cthe public\u2019s excessive generosity\u201d or \u201cexcessive contempt\u201d misjudge many figures. My summary directly reflects the article\u2019s self\u2010described \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of the public\u2019s ratings. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky\u2010centric reading ignores the article\u2019s explicit universal scorecard approach.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Slate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The author speculates whether public sentiment in each case is accurate.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky\u2010centric thesis misreads structure and evidence  \n   a. Opening on Currie, not Lewinsky: The lead paragraphs focus on Currie\u2019s misplaced sympathy (<quote>dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with</quote>) before introducing Lewinsky as just one example of misjudged participants. If Lewinsky\u2019s plight were central, Currie would not receive an entire introductory analysis.  \n   b. Title and tone emphasize the \u201cBlame Game\u201d: The phrase \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d implies a contest of assigning blame among **many** actors, not a singular victim narrative.  \n   c. Normative language applies universally: Terms like \u201csanctification,\u201d \u201cunbearable sanctimony,\u201d and \u201csmacks of hypocrisy\u201d recur for Stephanopoulos, Carville, Tripp, etc. Debater_A cannot explain why so much normative critique is directed at **others** if the sole concern is Lewinsky\u2019s public humiliation.  \n\n4. The article\u2019s conclusion and scorecard evolution confirm broad scope  \n   a.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

My proposal best captures the article\u2019s scope and purpose  \n   a. \u201cBelow is Slate\u2019s entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote>ranks 31 </quote>) shows Slate aims to assess everyone from Clinton to Chelsea Clinton, not just Lewinsky.  \n   b. The author repeatedly notes public mis\u2010ratings of multiple figures: \u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos\u2026Hypocritical\u201d (<quote> never shouldered blame </quote>), \u201cBetty Currie\u2026May have abetted\u201d (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>), \u201cLinda Tripp\u2019s allies\u2026absolutely no one else\u201d (<quote>No sale.</quote>). Only a global survey justifies all these mini\u2010essays.  \n   c. The article\u2019s title, \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game,\u201d implies blame is being assigned across participants, not focusing solely on Lewinsky.  \n\n2. Slate\u2019s stated goal is moral recalibration  \n   a. \u201cThe Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.\u201d Slate invites readers to reconsider sympathy for Currie, Lewinsky, Stephanopoulos, the Media, Paula Jones, etc., each evaluated on a -10 to +10 scale.  \n   b. The narrative repeatedly contrasts \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d vs. \u201cSlate rating,\u201d highlighting discrepancies for many figures. For instance:  \n      \u2022 Monica: Public -9, Slate -2 (<quote> much lower than Clinton's</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Chelsea Clinton: Public +10, Slate +10 (<quote> There are none </quote>)  \n      This pattern demonstrates Slate\u2019s broader project of \u201cspeculat[ing] upon whether those views are accurate.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s narrow Lewinsky interpretation is contradicted by the text  \n   a. If Lewinsky were the sole focus, why devote equal space to Clinton\u2019s \u201c-9\u201d rating or to \u201cThe Media\u201d at \u201c-8\u201d?  \n   b. The introduction calls Betty Currie \u201cone of the few truths universally acknowledged\u201d (<quote>dragooned </quote>) only to challenge that universal view. This sets up a template repeated throughout for multiple actors, not only Lewinsky.  \n   c. Slate even praises Alison Erskine Bowles, Henry Hyde, and the Secret Service\u2014actors peripheral to Lewinsky\u2014demonstrating a broader scope.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s thesis cannot account for Slate\u2019s \u201cScorecard\u201d methodology  \n   a. The -10 to +10 scale and detailed \u201cMinuses\u201d/\u201cPluses\u201d for each actor is a uniform rubric, not a special pleading for Lewinsky.  \n   b. Slate\u2019s consistency\u2014e.g., admonishing loyal aides who \u201cspun\u2026without bothering to check\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026Davis, Begala, McCurry\u2026</invalid_quote>)\u2014shows its interest in the public\u2019s misperceptions across the board.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s piece is a systematic \u201cBlame Game\u201d across all scandal participants, and its core claim is that \u201cthe public\u2019s excessive generosity\u201d or \u201cexcessive contempt\u201d misjudge many figures. My summary directly reflects the article\u2019s self\u2010described \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of the public\u2019s ratings. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky\u2010centric reading ignores the article\u2019s explicit universal scorecard approach.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSlate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\u201d\n\nI. Main Thesis of the Article Focuses on Lewinsky\u2019s Disproportionate Treatment  \n  1. Opening Emphasis:  \n     \u2022 The author begins by noting standard sympathy for one\u2014Betty Currie\u2014but immediately questions that sympathy (\u201cNot as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No.\u201d <invalid_quote>paragraph 2</invalid_quote>) to establish that even presumed innocents may be undeserving.  \n     \u2022 The very next paragraph introduces Monica Lewinsky, whose favorability is \u201c5 percent\u201d compared to Clinton\u2019s \u201cmuch higher\u201d ratings, and argues she \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 3</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 This sequencing signals that Lewinsky\u2019s treatment is the prime anomaly demanding a \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 2, last sentence</invalid_quote>).  \n\n  2. Moral Recalibration Thesis:  \n     \u2022 The phrase \u201cThe Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 2</invalid_quote>) introduces the article\u2019s project: to re\u2010evaluate public sympathies.  \n     \u2022 Though the scorecard includes 31 figures, its very purpose is to illustrate relative ratings\u2014Lewinsky at \u201c\u20132\u201d by Slate while she suffers \u201c\u20139\u201d in public polls, and others receive more lenient public marks despite similar or worse conduct.  \n\n  3. Repeated Contrast with Public Ratings:  \n     \u2022 The scorecard repeatedly highlights public hypocrisy (e.g., \u201cThe public\u2019s rating: \u20139\u201d for Lewinsky vs. \u201c+7\u201d for \u201cThe American People\u201d themselves) to expose misaligned public sentiment (<invalid_quote>Lewinsky entry</invalid_quote>, <quote>American People (The</quote>).  \n     \u2022 By spotlighting multiple agents (aides, lawyers, media) who \u201cspun\u2026denials\u201d without equal contempt, the article underscores the central wrong of shaming Lewinsky out of proportion.\n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cGeneral View\u201d Thesis Misreads the Article\u2019s Purpose  \n  1. Misplaced Generalization:  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s summary (\u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways\u2026speculates upon whether those views are accurate\u201d) is overly vague and fails to capture the article\u2019s normative thrust toward recalibrating toward Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 If the article were merely cataloguing \u201cpublic views,\u201d it would not paint so many figures as miscreants (e.g., Clinton \u20139, Morris \u20137, Tripp \u20137) only to urge \u201crecalibration.\u201d The very act of marking Slate\u2019s own ratings demonstrates an agenda, not neutrality.\n\n  2. Centrality of Lewinsky to \u201cScandal\u201d Narrative:  \n     \u2022 Lewinsky is the only non\u2010staff figure dragged \u201cinto the scandal against her will\u201d who is nevertheless \u201ccapable adult\u2026protected herself with immunity\u201d (<invalid_quote>Lewinsky plusses & minuses</invalid_quote>). This tension is the author\u2019s focal point.  \n     \u2022 The scandal\u2019s legal and political unraveling pivots on her testimony; other actors become relevant only insofar as they illustrate the injustice of her public branding.\n\n  3. Moral Imperative and Title:  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d title connotes a trap into which Lewinsky (the bait) is ensnared, evoking sympathy and injustice. Currie and others are used as foils to show that \u201cbait\u201d victims deserve better.  \n     \u2022 The moral imperative to relieve Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d cannot be squared with a bland \u201ccatalogue\u201d summary.\n\nIII. Evidence of Article\u2019s Prescriptive Aim  \n  1. Normative Language:  \n     \u2022 Terms like \u201csanctification,\u201d \u201cdragooned,\u201d \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d and \u201cpublic\u2019s excessive generosity\u201d combine critique and advocacy, signaling the article\u2019s prescriptive quality.  \n  2. Concluding Implication:  \n     \u2022 The scorecard ends with \u201cChelsea Clinton\u201d at +10\u2014another unwilling victim\u2014reinforcing that sympathy should follow forced-unwilling participants rather than willful deceivers.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The article is not a neutral inventory but a call to \u201crecalibrate\u201d our sympathies, with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s starkly low public rating serving as its central injustice. Debater_B\u2019s summary ignores the normative, focal concern for Lewinsky\u2019s plight and the moral urgency to correct it.

Currie and others are used as foils to show that \u201cbait\u201d victims deserve better.  \n     \u2022 The moral imperative to relieve Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d cannot be squared with a bland \u201ccatalogue\u201d summary.\n\nIII. Evidence of Article\u2019s Prescriptive Aim  \n  1. Normative Language:  \n     \u2022 Terms like \u201csanctification,\u201d \u201cdragooned,\u201d \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d and \u201cpublic\u2019s excessive generosity\u201d combine critique and advocacy, signaling the article\u2019s prescriptive quality.  \n  2. Concluding Implication:  \n     \u2022 The scorecard ends with \u201cChelsea Clinton\u201d at +10\u2014another unwilling victim\u2014reinforcing that sympathy should follow forced-unwilling participants rather than willful deceivers.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The article is not a neutral inventory but a call to \u201crecalibrate\u201d our sympathies, with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s starkly low public rating serving as its central injustice. Debater_B\u2019s summary ignores the normative, focal concern for Lewinsky\u2019s plight and the moral urgency to correct it. My position best captures both the structure and stated purpose of Slate\u2019s piece.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My proposal best captures the article\u2019s scope and purpose  \n   a. \u201cBelow is Slate\u2019s entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote>ranks 31 </quote>) shows Slate aims to assess everyone from Clinton to Chelsea Clinton, not just Lewinsky.  \n   b. The author repeatedly notes public mis\u2010ratings of multiple figures: \u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos\u2026Hypocritical\u201d (<quote> never shouldered blame </quote>), \u201cBetty Currie\u2026May have abetted\u201d (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>), \u201cLinda Tripp\u2019s allies\u2026absolutely no one else\u201d (<quote>No sale.</quote>). Only a global survey justifies all these mini\u2010essays.  \n   c. The article\u2019s title, \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game,\u201d implies blame is being assigned across participants, not focusing solely on Lewinsky.  \n\n2. Slate\u2019s stated goal is moral recalibration  \n   a. \u201cThe Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.\u201d Slate invites readers to reconsider sympathy for Currie, Lewinsky, Stephanopoulos, the Media, Paula Jones, etc., each evaluated on a -10 to +10 scale.  \n   b. The narrative repeatedly contrasts \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d vs. \u201cSlate rating,\u201d highlighting discrepancies for many figures. For instance:  \n      \u2022 Monica: Public -9, Slate -2 (<quote> much lower than Clinton's</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Chelsea Clinton: Public +10, Slate +10 (<quote> There are none </quote>)  \n      This pattern demonstrates Slate\u2019s broader project of \u201cspeculat[ing] upon whether those views are accurate.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s narrow Lewinsky interpretation is contradicted by the text  \n   a. If Lewinsky were the sole focus, why devote equal space to Clinton\u2019s \u201c-9\u201d rating or to \u201cThe Media\u201d at \u201c-8\u201d?  \n   b. The introduction calls Betty Currie \u201cone of the few truths universally acknowledged\u201d (<quote>dragooned </quote>) only to challenge that universal view. This sets up a template repeated throughout for multiple actors, not only Lewinsky.  \n   c. Slate even praises Alison Erskine Bowles, Henry Hyde, and the Secret Service\u2014actors peripheral to Lewinsky\u2014demonstrating a broader scope.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s thesis cannot account for Slate\u2019s \u201cScorecard\u201d methodology  \n   a. The -10 to +10 scale and detailed \u201cMinuses\u201d/\u201cPluses\u201d for each actor is a uniform rubric, not a special pleading for Lewinsky.  \n   b. Slate\u2019s consistency\u2014e.g., admonishing loyal aides who \u201cspun\u2026without bothering to check\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026Davis, Begala, McCurry\u2026</invalid_quote>)\u2014shows its interest in the public\u2019s misperceptions across the board.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s piece is a systematic \u201cBlame Game\u201d across all scandal participants, and its core claim is that \u201cthe public\u2019s excessive generosity\u201d or \u201cexcessive contempt\u201d misjudge many figures. My summary directly reflects the article\u2019s self\u2010described \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of the public\u2019s ratings. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky\u2010centric reading ignores the article\u2019s explicit universal scorecard approach.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Slate\u2019s Normative Re\u2010Evaluation Centers on Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cUniversal Contempt\u201d  \n  1. Sequencing and Language Signal Priority  \n     \u2022 Slate opens with Betty Currie only to \u201cchallenge\u201d her reputed innocence and immediately \u201csuggest[] a moral recalibration\u201d (paragraph 2) <invalid_quote>The Currie case suggests\u2026recalibration</invalid_quote>. But Currie is a mild -2 in Slate\u2019s own scorecard, while Monica is slate-rated -2 yet publicly scorned at -9. The author\u2019s effort is to lift Lewinsky\u2019s slate rating closer to the public\u2019s false bottom.  \n     \u2022 The author states that Monica \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d and calls her case \u201cfantastic[ally] low\u201d (<quote>favorability rating at 5 percent</quote>) juxtaposed with Clinton\u2019s still negative but higher public standing. This rhetorical move\u2014\u201chardly deserves\u201d\u2014is advocacy, not neutral cataloguing.  \n  2. \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d Focuses on Those \u201cDragged\u2026against their Will\u201d  \n     \u2022 Slate relentlessly treats \u201cunwilling\u201d victims (Currie, Lewinsky, Chelsea Clinton, Secret Service) more sympathetically and volunteers them for clemency. Yet only Lewinsky\u2019s slate score is depressed relative to her compulsion and betrayal.  \n     \u2022 Chelsea (+10 both public and Slate), Secret Service (+5 Slate vs. +8 public), and Cabinet (+3 Slate vs. +2 public) receive or approach positive Slate marks, reflecting Slate\u2019s view that \u201cdragooned\u201d participants deserve sympathy\u2014hence, Lewinsky\u2019s unduly low \u22122 is the anomaly demanding correction.  \n\nII. Slate\u2019s Uniform Rubric Serves to Illustrate, Not Equalize, Lewinsky\u2019s Injustice  \n  1. Consistent Application Underscores Exceptionality  \n     \u2022 Every \u201cspinner\u201d (Begala, Davis, McCurry) who \u201cspun\u2026denials\u201d gets Slate ratings between -1 and -3 despite public ambivalence or even generosity. That uniform harshness validates Slate\u2019s seriousness about deceit. Yet Lewinsky\u2014who \u201cseduced a married man\u201d and \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d\u2014receives only -2 by Slate\u2019s standards, a full seven\u2010point uplift over her public -9.  \n     \u2022 If Slate merely \u201ccatalogued\u201d without normative aim, it would rate Lewinsky as harshly as Clinton (-9) or Tripp (-7). Instead, Slate\u2019s rating scheme is designed to \u201cspeculate whether public views are accurate\u201d by rescuing the bait from the trap.  \n  2. Repeated Contrast of Slate vs. Public for Many Actors Reinforces Recalibration Thesis  \n     \u2022 Debater_B points to many Slate/public discrepancies\u2014but it is precisely these discrepancies that create moral tension only when they verge on injustice. Slate\u2019s own language (\u201cpersecuted,\u201d \u201cdragooned\u201d) appears only for unwilling figures; the article never calls for \u201crecalibration\u201d of public admiration for, say, Clinton or Morris\u2014Slate condemns them outright.  \n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cGlobal\u201d Reading Cannot Account for Slate\u2019s Prescriptive Choices  \n  1. Why Recalibrate Only Some Ratings?  \n     \u2022 Slate never urges us to raise Clinton\u2019s slate score closer to his public -6 (indeed Slate rates him -9). It never urges us to reduce the slate rating of any \u201cwilling deceivers\u201d to match their public condemnation: Morris (-7 Slate vs. -6 public), Tripp (-7 vs. -7), Stephanopoulos (-2 vs. +4).  \n     \u2022 The sole reconciliation is that these public ratings are fair or even too lenient; no moral imperative is signaled to adjust them. In contrast, Slate repeatedly laments Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cloquaciousness\u201d only as a product of exploitation and \u201cdragooning,\u201d inviting us to set aside contempt. That selective plea betrays Lewinsky\u2010centric concern.  \n  2. Title and Metaphor Emphasize the \u201cTrap\u201d Element  \n     \u2022 The \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d metaphor conjures an insect \u201cbait\u201d and an inescapable snare. Lewinsky is the obvious \u201cfly,\u201d young and powerless. Currie and others are analogies or foils to show that those likewise \u201cdragooned\u201d merit sympathy, while the true predators (Clinton, Morris, Starr) deserve condemnation.  \n\nIV. The \u201cUnraveling\u201d of the Scandal Hinges on Lewinsky\u2019s Testimony  \n  1. Central Pivot of Investigation  \n     \u2022 Only Lewinsky\u2019s immunity\u2010protected testimony compels Starr\u2019s relentless probe (Slate acknowledges Starr \u201cwas right,\u201d Slate rating +1). Without her, there is no \u201cunravelling.\u201d The weakest link in the \u201ctrap\u201d becomes the moral focus for salvation because she alone can break the cycle.  \n     \u2022 Slate praises Paula Jones (+1) for \u201cforce[d] Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open,\u201d yet Jones\u2019 public ambivalence receives Slate\u2019s nod. Lewinsky\u2019s comparable importance and harsher public scorn compel a stronger advocacy for her.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s article isn\u2019t a neutral encyclopedia of blame but a moral intervention aimed at rescuing an exploited \u201cbait\u201d\u2014Monica Lewinsky\u2014from disproportionate condemnation. My summary captures this prescriptive, focal concern. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cgeneral catalogue\u201d misreads both the article\u2019s selective calls for \u201crecalibration\u201d and its central metaphor of \u201cdragooned\u201d victims, without which the piece loses its moral urgency. My position best explains Slate\u2019s structure, language, and normative thrust.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My summary reflects the article\u2019s explicit framing and stated goals  \n   a. Universal scorecard: \u201cBelow is Slate\u2019s entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote>ranks 31</quote>) shows the article is presenting a comprehensive survey, not a case study limited to Monica Lewinsky.  \n   b. Repeated reference points: Every entry lists both \u201cPublic\u2019s rating\u201d and \u201cSlate rating,\u201d for figures ranging from Bill Clinton to Chelsea Clinton to the Secret Service (<invalid_quote>Public +10\u2026Slate +10</invalid_quote>, <invalid_quote>Public rating: +8\u2026Slate rating: +5</invalid_quote>), demonstrating the author\u2019s intent to compare and question public opinion across the board.  \n   c. Stated need for \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d: \u201cThe Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration\u201d (<invalid_quote>paragraph 2</invalid_quote>) sets the template for re\u2010evaluating **all** participants. If the scope were only Lewinsky, the author would not have prefaced the scorecard with Currie or concluded with Chelsea Clinton and peripheral actors like Erskine Bowles (<quote>Slate rating: +4</quote>) and Rep. Hyde (<quote>Slate rating: +4</quote>).  \n\n2. Lewinsky is one data point in a larger puzzle  \n   a. Multiple \u201cunwillingly dragged in\u201d actors: Betty Currie (<quote>dragooned</quote>), \u201cCabinet\u2026conscripted unwillingly,\u201d Secret Service (<quote>dragged unwillingly</quote>), Chelsea Clinton\u2014all receive Slate sympathy despite harsh public ratings. This pattern indicates the author\u2019s broader project of questioning where sympathy is due.  \n   b. Contrasting miscreants vs. victims: Aides who \u201cspun\u2026denials\u201d without investigation (Begala, Davis, McCurry) are marked negatively by Slate, even when public ratings are mild (<invalid_quote>McCurry public +2\u2026Slate -1</invalid_quote>), underscoring the theme \u201cpublic mis\u2010ratings\u201d for **all** actors.  \n   c. Balanced assessment of both \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d and \u201cexcessive contempt\u201d: The media (<quote>rating: +1</quote>) and Paula Jones (<quote>+1</quote>) are praised despite vilification, while Clinton associates are condemned despite loyalty. The author speculates whether public sentiment in each case is accurate.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky\u2010centric thesis misreads structure and evidence  \n   a. Opening on Currie, not Lewinsky: The lead paragraphs focus on Currie\u2019s misplaced sympathy (<quote>dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with</quote>) before introducing Lewinsky as just one example of misjudged participants. If Lewinsky\u2019s plight were central, Currie would not receive an entire introductory analysis.  \n   b. Title and tone emphasize the \u201cBlame Game\u201d: The phrase \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d implies a contest of assigning blame among **many** actors, not a singular victim narrative.  \n   c. Normative language applies universally: Terms like \u201csanctification,\u201d \u201cunbearable sanctimony,\u201d and \u201csmacks of hypocrisy\u201d recur for Stephanopoulos, Carville, Tripp, etc. Debater_A cannot explain why so much normative critique is directed at **others** if the sole concern is Lewinsky\u2019s public humiliation.  \n\n4. The article\u2019s conclusion and scorecard evolution confirm broad scope  \n   a. Chelsea Clinton\u2019s +10 Slate rating matches public +10 only by coincidence, showing Slate sometimes agrees with public view (not \u201cLewinsky rescue only\u201d).  \n   b. Peripheral actors (Erskine Bowles, Rep. Hyde) are included \u201cto prevent total executive paralysis,\u201d a policy concern irrelevant to Lewinsky\u2019s sexual scandal, but relevant to public misjudgment of their neutrality and virtue.  \n\n5. My summary best captures both breadth and purpose  \n   a. \u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved\u2026speculates upon whether those views are accurate\u201d precisely describes the public vs. Slate dichotomy repeated for **31** participants.  \n   b. The stated \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d is itself speculation on the accuracy of prevailing views. Debater_A\u2019s reading reduces this to a single case and ignores the author\u2019s systematic, rubric\u2010based methodology.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy beginning and ending with multiple figures, issuing normative judgments across a wide cast, and defining its mission as \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d Slate\u2019s piece indisputably aims to survey and critique the public\u2019s treatment of **all** scandal participants, not solely to champion Monica Lewinsky. My answer faithfully represents the article\u2019s comprehensive, comparative, and speculative approach; Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky\u2010only thesis is overly narrow and contradicted by the text.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
