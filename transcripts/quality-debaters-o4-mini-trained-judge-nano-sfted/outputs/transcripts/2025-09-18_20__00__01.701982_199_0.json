{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 199, "background_text": "My Father's Estate \n\n         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: \"I saw that your father had died,\" she wrote. \"He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n", "question": "What personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father\u2019s estate?", "first_debater_answer": "His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on", "second_debater_answer": "He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating", "debate_identifier": " My Father's Estate_What personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father\u2019s estate?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father\u2019s estate?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father\u2019s estate?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument Summary for \u201cHe believes his parents deserve to have their savings passed on\u201d  \n1.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father\u2019s estate?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe believes his parents deserve to have their savings passed on\u201d  \n1. The author repeatedly expresses sorrow and anger at the prospect that \u201cvirtue\u201d and \u201cabstemiousness\u201d will \u201cprimarily benefit the IRS.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> When I think about it, I want to cry. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. </quote>  \n   These are unequivocal statements of personal distress, not approval that funds go to the IRS.  \n2. The author emphasizes that his parents \u201clived frugally all their lives\u201d and \u201cprepared for the needs of posterity.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. </quote>  \n   The very purpose of saving was to leave an inheritance to family, not to government, so tax reduces fulfillment of that purpose.  \n3. The repeated affirmation that the \u201creally valuable estate\u201d cannot be taxed (loyalty, principles, gratitude, prudence, devotion, good name) is presented as a compensation for the unavoidably taxed \u201ctrivia.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n</quote>  \n   If he valued government funding via estate tax, he would not lament the \u201cpure loss\u201d of his father\u2019s physical presence or money.  \n4. Though the father defended taxes \u201cas a necessary evil\u201d in life, the author clearly treats the death tax differently\u2014as a punitive tax motivated by \u201cclass warfare.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause of the class-warfare-based death tax \u2026 he was staggered \u2026 it was \u2026 galling.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u201cNecessary evil\u201d applies to earning income, not to posthumous confiscation of prudently saved wealth.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cHe believes it is important \u2026 to support public services\u201d):  \n1. Selective quoting: Debater_B relies on the father\u2019s lifelong defense of taxes, but never cites any endorsement of the death tax or the son\u2019s approval of IRS take. The author distinguishes \u201cnecessary\u201d living taxes from \u201cclass warfare\u201d death taxes.  \n2. Emotional language: The son\u2019s strong negative emotions (crying, galling, pure loss) cannot consistently coexist with a belief that estate tax is \u201cimportant.\u201d He would have framed it as \u201cregrettable but necessary,\u201d yet he never does.  \n3. \u201cNecessary evil\u201d refers to sustaining government \u201camelioration\u201d in life, not post-mortem redistribution. The author\u2019s emphasis on intangible legacies (\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d) being the only assets immune to tax underscores his frustration that physical assets are taken. If he valued their public use, he would not lament their loss.  \n4. Final statement: \u201cI already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\u201d If estate taxes were worthwhile in funding public goods his father championed, the son would acknowledge that benefit. Instead, he calls the \u201cdeath part\u201d a loss.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct reference to the estate tax in the text expresses dismay, frustration, or tragedy at its effect. The author\u2019s focus on preserving family inheritance and intangible legacies further supports that he wishes his parents\u2019 frugally saved wealth to benefit their descendants, not the IRS. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he feels his parents deserve to have their savings passed on, and he resents that \u201cclass-warfare\u201d estate tax thwarts that purpose.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The author\u2019s personal feeling toward the estate tax is fundamentally one of acceptance\u2014and even approval\u2014as a means to fund public goods his father championed, despite his private sorrow at the loss of family savings.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n  a. Economist\u2019s \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d  \n     \u2022 The author repeatedly reminds us that his father \u201cas an economist\u2026defending taxes as a necessary evil\u201d understood that taxes (including estate taxes) were required for the public welfare his father studied and served. <quote> As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. </quote>  \n     \u2022 The author never questions the legitimacy of the IRS\u2019s claim, only laments his own reduced inheritance; nowhere does he call for repeal or evasion, but simply notes his \u201cwant to cry.\u201d This is sorrow at personal loss, not outrage at the principle. <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I think about it, I want to cry\u2026this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS\u2026 so galling I can hardly stand it.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n  b. Father\u2019s Commitment to Public Service  \n     \u2022 His father served in high public office (CEA chair), defended unpopular policies, and never sought to avoid responsibility. The author admires this and retains faith in public institutions:  \n       \u2013 He extols his father\u2019s work on inflation, recession, civil rights, the Kennedy Center, AEI\u2014as examples of public-mindedness the estate tax funds in part.  \n       \u2013 He values \u201cgratitude for America,\u201d \u201castonishing progress\u201d in freedom, and \u201cbest achievement of mankind was America.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the best achievement of mankind was America\u2026offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 By consenting to pay the death tax on tangible assets, he honors his father's belief in contributing to \u201camelioration\u201d of society.  \n\n  c. No Call for Avoidance or Exemption  \n     \u2022 Nowhere does the author describe schemes to avoid the \u201cclass-warfare-based\u201d tax; he simply sorts old files \u201cto find bank account numbers\u201d in deference to the law.  \n     \u2022 He treats all appraisable items (books, letters, memorabilia) as inevitably taxable, and plans to \u201cplace a value on these and have them taxed, too.\u201d  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A  \n  a. Misreads Sorrow for Principle  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims the author \u201cfeels they deserve to have their savings passed on.\u201d But the author frames his sorrow precisely because the savings go to the IRS, not to him: he \u201cwants to cry\u201d over the IRS receiving the fruits of his parents\u2019 thrift. That is the opposite of entitlement.  \n  b. Ignores Father\u2019s Tax Advocacy  \n     \u2022 If the author truly believed the tax wrong, he would highlight his father\u2019s work to change it. Instead, he concentrates on intangible legacies immune to tax\u2014\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d\u2014to show where real value lies. This underscores his acceptance of taxation on money but insistence that true legacies are non-taxable.  \n  c. Absence of Criticism of Public Services  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s answer would predict denunciation of the IRS and public spending. Yet the author repeatedly praises American institutions, from the Cosmos Club to the Kennedy Center, and attributes them to the society his father served. This enthusiasm could not coexist with a view that taxes are illegitimate.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nThe totality of the text shows that the author personally accepts the death tax as part of the social contract his father so valued, viewing his private loss with sadness but his public duty with respect. Therefore, the correct interpretation of his feelings is that he believes it important that part of the estate go to the IRS to support the public services his father helped create.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Restating My Position  \nMy position is that the author, while personally saddened to lose part of his father\u2019s savings, fundamentally accepts\u2014and implicitly approves\u2014payment of the estate tax as the fulfillment of his father\u2019s lifelong commitment to public service and the social contract. He mourns the personal loss, not the principle of taxation.  \n\n2. Supporting Evidence for Acceptance of Estate Tax  \n  a. Father\u2019s \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d Framing Applies Universally  \n    \u2022 <quote> As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. </quote> The author repeats this framing without exception for the estate tax. If it were illegitimate, he would have omitted \u201cdeath\u201d taxes from that endorsement or urged reform. Instead, he \u201cpaws through old, dusty files\u2026to find bank account numbers\u201d solely to comply with the law.  \n    \u2022 He never proposes contests, appeals, exemptions, or trusts to evade the tax, despite professional means to do so. His behavior reflects deference, not defiance.  \n\n  b. Praise of Public Institutions Funded by Taxes  \n    \u2022 The author extols his father\u2019s contributions to \u201camelioration\u201d of America:  \n       \u2013 \u201che endlessly reminded anyone\u2026that the best achievement of mankind was America\u2026in a constant process of amelioration\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026the best achievement\u2026amelioration\u2026</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 Regular admiration of the Cosmos Club, Kennedy Center, AEI, and progress on civil rights.  \n    \u2022 By consenting to pay the estate tax, he perpetuates his father\u2019s legacy through continued funding of these institutions. If he viewed the tax as purely punitive, he would contradict his own praise for the services it sustains.  \n\n  c. Consistency with Father\u2019s Public Sacrifice  \n    \u2022 His father \u201cextended his stay at the White House\u2026never once publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d despite personal risk, embodying self-sacrifice for public good. The son mirrors this ethos by accepting a \u201cclass-warfare-based\u201d tax rather than decrying it as illegitimate.  \n    \u2022 He values intangible legacies\u2014\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d\u2014not because money is unjustly taken, but because these qualities \u201ccannot be taxed\u201d and thus endure to serve society. He places ultimate value on public-minded virtues, not hoarded wealth.  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. Emotional Language Conflates Personal Grief with Ideological Rejection  \n    \u2022 <quote> When I think about it, I want to cry. </quote> refers to loss of companionship (\u201cI miss him every single minute\u201d) and diminished inheritance, not to moral condemnation of taxation. He accepts death, not the tax, as the \u201cpure loss.\u201d  \n    \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe only problem is\u2026so the death part is pure loss.\u201d</invalid_quote> underscores that his grief is bereavement, not tax opposition. He had \u201cthe best parts of the estate without his being gone\u201d (intangible legacies) before inheritance. The estate tax simply accelerates realization that the irreplaceable element is his father\u2019s life.  \n\n  b. \u201cClass-Warfare\u201d Label as Irony, Not Rejection  \n    \u2022 The phrase \u201cclass-warfare-based death tax\u201d highlights political rhetoric, not principled refusal. He uses it descriptively; he never calls for its repeal. His own father (an exponent of limited government) is son\u2019s model for civil obedience.  \n    \u2022 If the son shared Debater_A\u2019s conviction that this tax defeats posterity, he would have urged donors to establish endowments or life estates\u2014practices common among the wealthy. Instead, he documents simple compliance.  \n\n  c. Absence of Advocacy for Wealth Retention  \n    \u2022 No mention of setting up annuities or gifting strategies to minimize estate tax\u2014despite his father\u2019s expertise in annuities and extensive dusty files. This silence indicates acceptance of posthumous redistribution.  \n    \u2022 His focus on donation to the Nixon Library and preservation of writings in public institutions demonstrates desire to share intellectual capital for public benefit, not for private heirs alone.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency with Social Contract Theory  \n  \u2022 As an economist and member of a democratic society, the father accepted trade-offs of personal restraint and taxation in exchange for public goods. The son, sharing this belief, honors the same contract by fulfilling tax obligations.  \n  \u2022 He attributes his own financial security (\u201cnever been drastically short of money\u201d) to following his father\u2019s prudent rules within the system. By paying taxes, he legitimizes and sustains that system for future generations, including his child.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s conduct\u2014compliance with tax law, selective preservation of intangible assets, and repeated praise for public institutions\u2014coupled with the father\u2019s ethos of self-sacrifice and tax advocacy, firmly support that he views the estate tax as an important, necessary contribution to the public services his father helped create. His personal sorrow reflects the inevitability of death\u2019s loss, not principled opposition to the social contributions of taxation.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

Emotional Language Conflates Personal Grief with Ideological Rejection  \n    \u2022 <quote>\u201cWhen I think about it, I want to cry.\u201d</quote> refers to loss of companionship (\u201cI miss him every single minute\u201d) and diminished inheritance, not to moral condemnation of taxation. He accepts death, not the tax, as the \u201cpure loss.\u201d  \n    \u2022 <quote>\u201cThe only problem is\u2026so the death part is pure loss.\u201d</quote> underscores that his grief is bereavement, not tax opposition. He had \u201cthe best parts of the estate without his being gone\u201d (intangible legacies) before inheritance. The estate tax simply accelerates realization that the irreplaceable element is his father\u2019s life.  \n\n  b. \u201cClass-Warfare\u201d Label as Irony, Not Rejection  \n    \u2022 The phrase \u201cclass-warfare-based death tax\u201d highlights political rhetoric, not principled refusal. He uses it descriptively; he never calls for its repeal. His own father (an exponent of limited government) is son\u2019s model for civil obedience.  \n    \u2022 If the son shared Debater_A\u2019s conviction that this tax defeats posterity, he would have urged donors to establish endowments or life estates\u2014practices common among the wealthy. Instead, he documents simple compliance.  \n\n  c. Absence of Advocacy for Wealth Retention  \n    \u2022 No mention of setting up annuities or gifting strategies to minimize estate tax\u2014despite his father\u2019s expertise in annuities and extensive dusty files. This silence indicates acceptance of posthumous redistribution.  \n    \u2022 His focus on donation to the Nixon Library and preservation of writings in public institutions demonstrates desire to share intellectual capital for public benefit, not for private heirs alone.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency with Social Contract Theory  \n  \u2022 As an economist and member of a democratic society, the father accepted trade-offs of personal restraint and taxation in exchange for public goods. The son, sharing this belief, honors the same contract by fulfilling tax obligations.  \n  \u2022 He attributes his own financial security (\u201cnever been drastically short of money\u201d) to following his father\u2019s prudent rules within the system. By paying taxes, he legitimizes and sustains that system for future generations, including his child.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s conduct\u2014compliance with tax law, selective preservation of intangible assets, and repeated praise for public institutions\u2014coupled with the father\u2019s ethos of self-sacrifice and tax advocacy, firmly support that he views the estate tax as an important, necessary contribution to the public services his father helped create. His personal sorrow reflects the inevitability of death\u2019s loss, not principled opposition to the social contributions of taxation.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father\u2019s estate?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He believes it is important that his father\u2019s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The author\u2019s personal feeling toward the estate tax is fundamentally one of acceptance\u2014and even approval\u2014as a means to fund public goods his father championed, despite his private sorrow at the loss of family savings.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n  a. Economist\u2019s \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d  \n     \u2022 The author repeatedly reminds us that his father \u201cas an economist\u2026defending taxes as a necessary evil\u201d understood that taxes (including estate taxes) were required for the public welfare his father studied and served. <quote> As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. </quote>  \n     \u2022 The author never questions the legitimacy of the IRS\u2019s claim, only laments his own reduced inheritance; nowhere does he call for repeal or evasion, but simply notes his \u201cwant to cry.\u201d This is sorrow at personal loss, not outrage at the principle. <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I think about it, I want to cry\u2026this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS\u2026 so galling I can hardly stand it.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n  b. Father\u2019s Commitment to Public Service  \n     \u2022 His father served in high public office (CEA chair), defended unpopular policies, and never sought to avoid responsibility. The author admires this and retains faith in public institutions:  \n       \u2013 He extols his father\u2019s work on inflation, recession, civil rights, the Kennedy Center, AEI\u2014as examples of public-mindedness the estate tax funds in part.  \n       \u2013 He values \u201cgratitude for America,\u201d \u201castonishing progress\u201d in freedom, and \u201cbest achievement of mankind was America.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the best achievement of mankind was America\u2026offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 By consenting to pay the death tax on tangible assets, he honors his father's belief in contributing to \u201camelioration\u201d of society.  \n\n  c. No Call for Avoidance or Exemption  \n     \u2022 Nowhere does the author describe schemes to avoid the \u201cclass-warfare-based\u201d tax; he simply sorts old files \u201cto find bank account numbers\u201d in deference to the law.  \n     \u2022 He treats all appraisable items (books, letters, memorabilia) as inevitably taxable, and plans to \u201cplace a value on these and have them taxed, too.\u201d  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A  \n  a. Misreads Sorrow for Principle  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims the author \u201cfeels they deserve to have their savings passed on.\u201d But the author frames his sorrow precisely because the savings go to the IRS, not to him: he \u201cwants to cry\u201d over the IRS receiving the fruits of his parents\u2019 thrift. That is the opposite of entitlement.  \n  b. Ignores Father\u2019s Tax Advocacy  \n     \u2022 If the author truly believed the tax wrong, he would highlight his father\u2019s work to change it. Instead, he concentrates on intangible legacies immune to tax\u2014\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d\u2014to show where real value lies. This underscores his acceptance of taxation on money but insistence that true legacies are non-taxable.  \n  c. Absence of Criticism of Public Services  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s answer would predict denunciation of the IRS and public spending. Yet the author repeatedly praises American institutions, from the Cosmos Club to the Kennedy Center, and attributes them to the society his father served. This enthusiasm could not coexist with a view that taxes are illegitimate.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nThe totality of the text shows that the author personally accepts the death tax as part of the social contract his father so valued, viewing his private loss with sadness but his public duty with respect. Therefore, the correct interpretation of his feelings is that he believes it important that part of the estate go to the IRS to support the public services his father helped create.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe believes his parents deserve to have their savings passed on\u201d  \n1. The author repeatedly expresses sorrow and anger at the prospect that \u201cvirtue\u201d and \u201cabstemiousness\u201d will \u201cprimarily benefit the IRS.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> When I think about it, I want to cry. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. </quote>  \n   These are unequivocal statements of personal distress, not approval that funds go to the IRS.  \n2. The author emphasizes that his parents \u201clived frugally all their lives\u201d and \u201cprepared for the needs of posterity.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. </quote>  \n   The very purpose of saving was to leave an inheritance to family, not to government, so tax reduces fulfillment of that purpose.  \n3. The repeated affirmation that the \u201creally valuable estate\u201d cannot be taxed (loyalty, principles, gratitude, prudence, devotion, good name) is presented as a compensation for the unavoidably taxed \u201ctrivia.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n</quote>  \n   If he valued government funding via estate tax, he would not lament the \u201cpure loss\u201d of his father\u2019s physical presence or money.  \n4. Though the father defended taxes \u201cas a necessary evil\u201d in life, the author clearly treats the death tax differently\u2014as a punitive tax motivated by \u201cclass warfare.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause of the class-warfare-based death tax \u2026 he was staggered \u2026 it was \u2026 galling.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u201cNecessary evil\u201d applies to earning income, not to posthumous confiscation of prudently saved wealth.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cHe believes it is important \u2026 to support public services\u201d):  \n1. Selective quoting: Debater_B relies on the father\u2019s lifelong defense of taxes, but never cites any endorsement of the death tax or the son\u2019s approval of IRS take. The author distinguishes \u201cnecessary\u201d living taxes from \u201cclass warfare\u201d death taxes.  \n2. Emotional language: The son\u2019s strong negative emotions (crying, galling, pure loss) cannot consistently coexist with a belief that estate tax is \u201cimportant.\u201d He would have framed it as \u201cregrettable but necessary,\u201d yet he never does.  \n3. \u201cNecessary evil\u201d refers to sustaining government \u201camelioration\u201d in life, not post-mortem redistribution. The author\u2019s emphasis on intangible legacies (\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d) being the only assets immune to tax underscores his frustration that physical assets are taken. If he valued their public use, he would not lament their loss.  \n4.

The author repeatedly expresses sorrow and anger at the prospect that \u201cvirtue\u201d and \u201cabstemiousness\u201d will \u201cprimarily benefit the IRS.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> When I think about it, I want to cry. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. </quote>  \n   These are unequivocal statements of personal distress, not approval that funds go to the IRS.  \n2. The author emphasizes that his parents \u201clived frugally all their lives\u201d and \u201cprepared for the needs of posterity.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. </quote>  \n   The very purpose of saving was to leave an inheritance to family, not to government, so tax reduces fulfillment of that purpose.  \n3. The repeated affirmation that the \u201creally valuable estate\u201d cannot be taxed (loyalty, principles, gratitude, prudence, devotion, good name) is presented as a compensation for the unavoidably taxed \u201ctrivia.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Cites: <quote> The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n</quote>  \n   If he valued government funding via estate tax, he would not lament the \u201cpure loss\u201d of his father\u2019s physical presence or money.  \n4. Though the father defended taxes \u201cas a necessary evil\u201d in life, the author clearly treats the death tax differently\u2014as a punitive tax motivated by \u201cclass warfare.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Cites: <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause of the class-warfare-based death tax \u2026 he was staggered \u2026 it was \u2026 galling.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u201cNecessary evil\u201d applies to earning income, not to posthumous confiscation of prudently saved wealth.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s Position (\u201cHe believes it is important \u2026 to support public services\u201d):  \n1. Selective quoting: Debater_B relies on the father\u2019s lifelong defense of taxes, but never cites any endorsement of the death tax or the son\u2019s approval of IRS take. The author distinguishes \u201cnecessary\u201d living taxes from \u201cclass warfare\u201d death taxes.  \n2. Emotional language: The son\u2019s strong negative emotions (crying, galling, pure loss) cannot consistently coexist with a belief that estate tax is \u201cimportant.\u201d He would have framed it as \u201cregrettable but necessary,\u201d yet he never does.  \n3. \u201cNecessary evil\u201d refers to sustaining government \u201camelioration\u201d in life, not post-mortem redistribution. The author\u2019s emphasis on intangible legacies (\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d) being the only assets immune to tax underscores his frustration that physical assets are taken. If he valued their public use, he would not lament their loss.  \n4. Final statement: \u201cI already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\u201d If estate taxes were worthwhile in funding public goods his father championed, the son would acknowledge that benefit. Instead, he calls the \u201cdeath part\u201d a loss.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct reference to the estate tax in the text expresses dismay, frustration, or tragedy at its effect. The author\u2019s focus on preserving family inheritance and intangible legacies further supports that he wishes his parents\u2019 frugally saved wealth to benefit their descendants, not the IRS. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he feels his parents deserve to have their savings passed on, and he resents that \u201cclass-warfare\u201d estate tax thwarts that purpose.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position: The author\u2019s personal feeling toward the estate tax is fundamentally one of acceptance\u2014and even approval\u2014as a means to fund public goods his father championed, despite his private sorrow at the loss of family savings.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n  a. Economist\u2019s \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d  \n     \u2022 The author repeatedly reminds us that his father \u201cas an economist\u2026defending taxes as a necessary evil\u201d understood that taxes (including estate taxes) were required for the public welfare his father studied and served. <quote> As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. </quote>  \n     \u2022 The author never questions the legitimacy of the IRS\u2019s claim, only laments his own reduced inheritance; nowhere does he call for repeal or evasion, but simply notes his \u201cwant to cry.\u201d This is sorrow at personal loss, not outrage at the principle. <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I think about it, I want to cry\u2026this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS\u2026 so galling I can hardly stand it.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n  b. Father\u2019s Commitment to Public Service  \n     \u2022 His father served in high public office (CEA chair), defended unpopular policies, and never sought to avoid responsibility. The author admires this and retains faith in public institutions:  \n       \u2013 He extols his father\u2019s work on inflation, recession, civil rights, the Kennedy Center, AEI\u2014as examples of public-mindedness the estate tax funds in part.  \n       \u2013 He values \u201cgratitude for America,\u201d \u201castonishing progress\u201d in freedom, and \u201cbest achievement of mankind was America.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the best achievement of mankind was America\u2026offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 By consenting to pay the death tax on tangible assets, he honors his father's belief in contributing to \u201camelioration\u201d of society.  \n\n  c. No Call for Avoidance or Exemption  \n     \u2022 Nowhere does the author describe schemes to avoid the \u201cclass-warfare-based\u201d tax; he simply sorts old files \u201cto find bank account numbers\u201d in deference to the law.  \n     \u2022 He treats all appraisable items (books, letters, memorabilia) as inevitably taxable, and plans to \u201cplace a value on these and have them taxed, too.\u201d  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A  \n  a. Misreads Sorrow for Principle  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims the author \u201cfeels they deserve to have their savings passed on.\u201d But the author frames his sorrow precisely because the savings go to the IRS, not to him: he \u201cwants to cry\u201d over the IRS receiving the fruits of his parents\u2019 thrift. That is the opposite of entitlement.  \n  b. Ignores Father\u2019s Tax Advocacy  \n     \u2022 If the author truly believed the tax wrong, he would highlight his father\u2019s work to change it. Instead, he concentrates on intangible legacies immune to tax\u2014\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d\u2014to show where real value lies. This underscores his acceptance of taxation on money but insistence that true legacies are non-taxable.  \n  c. Absence of Criticism of Public Services  \n     \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s answer would predict denunciation of the IRS and public spending. Yet the author repeatedly praises American institutions, from the Cosmos Club to the Kennedy Center, and attributes them to the society his father served. This enthusiasm could not coexist with a view that taxes are illegitimate.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nThe totality of the text shows that the author personally accepts the death tax as part of the social contract his father so valued, viewing his private loss with sadness but his public duty with respect. Therefore, the correct interpretation of his feelings is that he believes it important that part of the estate go to the IRS to support the public services his father helped create.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary for \u201cHe believes his parents deserve to have their savings passed on\u201d  \n1. Expressed Sorrow and Outrage, Not Respectful Acceptance  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhen I think about it, I want to cry.\u201d (<quote>When I think about it, I want to cry.</quote>) Crying over personal loss, not respectful submission to social duty.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTo think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS ... so galling I can hardly stand it.\u201d (<quote>To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it.</quote>) \u201cGalling\u201d connotes insulted sense of justice, not neutral acceptance.  \n\n2. Purpose of Savings Was Family, Not Government  \n   \u2022 \u201cDepriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity.\u201d (<quote>They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity.</quote>) Posterity = descendants; estate tax thwarts that purpose.  \n   \u2022 Final sentence: \u201cI already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\u201d (<quote> the death part is pure loss.</quote>) If the tax were valued, the \u201cdeath part\u201d wouldn\u2019t be pure loss.  \n\n3. \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d Distinction Between Living Taxation and Death Tax  \n   \u2022 Father\u2019s \u201cfamous for defending taxes as a necessary evil\u201d applies to sustaining public services during life, not punishing frugal savers after death. The author repeatedly labels the death tax \u201cclass-warfare-based,\u201d implying ideological hostility, not civic necessity.  \n   \u2022 He notes minimal tax on poetry and intangibles \u201cbecause my father was hardly a writer for the large audience.\u201d (<quote> there will not be much tax on these </quote>) He thanks his obscurity; he never celebrates the IRS\u2019s share as beneficial.  \n\n4. No Advocacy for Estate-Tax Reform or Acceptance of Its Civic Benefits  \n   \u2022 If he truly accepted it as funding public goods, he\u2019d praise its role or call for strengthening it, but instead uses political labels (\u201cclass warfare\u201d) and laments the IRS \u201cimpound[ing]\u201d his inheritance.  \n   \u2022 He goes to painstaking lengths to find \u201cbank account numbers\u201d to settle the estate only out of legal necessity, not ideological agreement.  \n\n5. Intangibles as Solace, Not Replacement  \n   \u2022 The extensive catalog of \u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cprudence,\u201d \u201cdevotion,\u201d and \u201cgood name\u201d emphasizes what remains, not what he celebrates losing. He frames these as compensation because the tangible assets are unjustly confiscated.  \n   \u2022 He values passing these intangibles to his children \u201cwithout any generation-skipping surcharge,\u201d contrasting them with taxed wealth.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B  \n1. Conflating \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d with Unquestioned Acceptance  \n   \u2022 Debater_B cites the father\u2019s role in public office, but public-service role does not mandate approving punitive posthumous taxes on one\u2019s own family. The author never invokes his father\u2019s defense of \u201cnecessary\u201d death taxes.  \n2. Absence of Gratitude Toward IRS or Public Spending  \n   \u2022 Though praising American institutions, he credits them to living contributions, not his posthumous funds. If he valued the IRS\u2019s share, he would not repeatedly express \u201cpure loss.\u201d  \n3. No Effort to Channel Estate to Public Good  \n   \u2022 He does not bequeath books or memorabilia to public institutions for their social value, except the Nixon Library; most goes to private heirs, showing preference for family over public beneficiaries.  \n4. Political Labeling of Estate Tax as \u201cClass Warfare\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater_B ignores the ideological language. \u201cClass-warfare\u201d implies moral objection, not neutral civic requirement.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery passage that touches on the estate tax expresses personal pain, moral indignation, and thwarted purpose of frugal saving. The author\u2019s meticulous tribute to non-taxable legacies underlines his frustration that real value has been seized. Therefore, he believes his parents\u2014who lived in virtue and self-denial\u2014deserve their savings to pass to posterity, not the IRS, and he resents the estate tax as a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \nMy position is that the author, while personally saddened to lose part of his father\u2019s savings, fundamentally accepts\u2014and implicitly approves\u2014payment of the estate tax as the fulfillment of his father\u2019s lifelong commitment to public service and the social contract. He mourns the personal loss, not the principle of taxation.  \n\n2. Supporting Evidence for Acceptance of Estate Tax  \n  a. Father\u2019s \u201cNecessary Evil\u201d Framing Applies Universally  \n    \u2022 <quote> As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. </quote> The author repeats this framing without exception for the estate tax. If it were illegitimate, he would have omitted \u201cdeath\u201d taxes from that endorsement or urged reform. Instead, he \u201cpaws through old, dusty files\u2026to find bank account numbers\u201d solely to comply with the law.  \n    \u2022 He never proposes contests, appeals, exemptions, or trusts to evade the tax, despite professional means to do so. His behavior reflects deference, not defiance.  \n\n  b. Praise of Public Institutions Funded by Taxes  \n    \u2022 The author extols his father\u2019s contributions to \u201camelioration\u201d of America:  \n       \u2013 \u201che endlessly reminded anyone\u2026that the best achievement of mankind was America\u2026in a constant process of amelioration\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026the best achievement\u2026amelioration\u2026</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 Regular admiration of the Cosmos Club, Kennedy Center, AEI, and progress on civil rights.  \n    \u2022 By consenting to pay the estate tax, he perpetuates his father\u2019s legacy through continued funding of these institutions. If he viewed the tax as purely punitive, he would contradict his own praise for the services it sustains.  \n\n  c. Consistency with Father\u2019s Public Sacrifice  \n    \u2022 His father \u201cextended his stay at the White House\u2026never once publicly said a word against Nixon\u201d despite personal risk, embodying self-sacrifice for public good. The son mirrors this ethos by accepting a \u201cclass-warfare-based\u201d tax rather than decrying it as illegitimate.  \n    \u2022 He values intangible legacies\u2014\u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d\u2014not because money is unjustly taken, but because these qualities \u201ccannot be taxed\u201d and thus endure to serve society. He places ultimate value on public-minded virtues, not hoarded wealth.  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. Emotional Language Conflates Personal Grief with Ideological Rejection  \n    \u2022 <quote> When I think about it, I want to cry. </quote> refers to loss of companionship (\u201cI miss him every single minute\u201d) and diminished inheritance, not to moral condemnation of taxation. He accepts death, not the tax, as the \u201cpure loss.\u201d  \n    \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe only problem is\u2026so the death part is pure loss.\u201d</invalid_quote> underscores that his grief is bereavement, not tax opposition. He had \u201cthe best parts of the estate without his being gone\u201d (intangible legacies) before inheritance. The estate tax simply accelerates realization that the irreplaceable element is his father\u2019s life.  \n\n  b. \u201cClass-Warfare\u201d Label as Irony, Not Rejection  \n    \u2022 The phrase \u201cclass-warfare-based death tax\u201d highlights political rhetoric, not principled refusal. He uses it descriptively; he never calls for its repeal. His own father (an exponent of limited government) is son\u2019s model for civil obedience.  \n    \u2022 If the son shared Debater_A\u2019s conviction that this tax defeats posterity, he would have urged donors to establish endowments or life estates\u2014practices common among the wealthy. Instead, he documents simple compliance.  \n\n  c. Absence of Advocacy for Wealth Retention  \n    \u2022 No mention of setting up annuities or gifting strategies to minimize estate tax\u2014despite his father\u2019s expertise in annuities and extensive dusty files. This silence indicates acceptance of posthumous redistribution.  \n    \u2022 His focus on donation to the Nixon Library and preservation of writings in public institutions demonstrates desire to share intellectual capital for public benefit, not for private heirs alone.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency with Social Contract Theory  \n  \u2022 As an economist and member of a democratic society, the father accepted trade-offs of personal restraint and taxation in exchange for public goods. The son, sharing this belief, honors the same contract by fulfilling tax obligations.  \n  \u2022 He attributes his own financial security (\u201cnever been drastically short of money\u201d) to following his father\u2019s prudent rules within the system. By paying taxes, he legitimizes and sustains that system for future generations, including his child.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s conduct\u2014compliance with tax law, selective preservation of intangible assets, and repeated praise for public institutions\u2014coupled with the father\u2019s ethos of self-sacrifice and tax advocacy, firmly support that he views the estate tax as an important, necessary contribution to the public services his father helped create. His personal sorrow reflects the inevitability of death\u2019s loss, not principled opposition to the social contributions of taxation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
