Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

And I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \"Hel-lo-o-o!\" And then I had the idea to take him pizza! \n\n          \n\n            TRIPP: And then what happened? \n\n         \"What Went On\" (upbeat) \n\n                         LEWINSKY: Then I led him on. \n\n         I showed him my thong, \n\n         I let him take a long and ling'ring look. \n\n         I led him on. \n\n         He studied my thong, \n\n         And from that point I had the president hooked. \n\n         That night when I took the president some pizza, \n\n         I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece. \n\n         We went into the hallway by his study \n\n         And dispensed with formalities. \n\n                         TRIPP: Oh please go on! \n\n         You must go on! \n\n         Come on, girlfriend, \n\n         Spill, spill, spill, spill, spill! \n\n         Now go on, \n\n         Please go on. \n\n         Did Clinton let you say hi to Little Bill? \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: His lips and mine locked in a kiss fantastic, \n\n         His hands roved freely 'neath my blouse, \n\n         I reached into the presidential trousers, \n\n         And he got a phone call from a member of the House. \n\n         So I went on, \n\n         While he talked on the phone, \n\n         I took a position before him on my knees, \n\n         And I went on. \n\n         And he talked on. \n\n         Though what the congressman heard was \n\n          \"Please, please, please, please, please!\" \n\n         But then we didn't go on! \n\n                         TRIPP: You didn't go on? \n\n                         LEWINSKY: No, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp. \n\n                         TRIPP: So you didn't go on? \n\n                         LEWINSKY: No, we didn't go on. \n\n         He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he \n\n         Could \n\n         Trust. \n\n                         [The lights fade as the girlfriends engage in cross talk.]              \n\n                         TRIPP: Trust? \n\n                         LEWINSKY: That's why we didn't go on. \n\n                         TRIPP: That's so weird!

My Position: The intern\u2019s sole purpose in the Oval Office during a budget\u2010imposed shutdown is cost\u2010saving, not mere \u201corganization.\u201d  \n   a. Shutdown Context  \n      \u2022 <quote>Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close. All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs.</quote> (PANETTA, ICKES) \u2013 Only \u201cessential personnel\u201d remain. Keeping every full\u2010time staffer would negate the Republicans\u2019 bargaining tool.  \n      \u2022 <quote>off. Tell the maids and cooks and butlers To go play themselves some golf. We have to do without the clerks Let them all go</quote> (CLINTON) \u2013 The president explicitly furloughs paid staff.  \n   b. Intern as Minimal\u2010Cost Placeholder  \n      \u2022 <quote>We'll bring in an intern, I assure you, Mr. President-- Your routine here won't get blown. PANETTA ,</quote> (PANETTA) \u2013 An intern typically serves as a low\u2010wage (often unpaid or stipend) resource, drastically reducing payroll expenses.  \n      \u2022 Interns accept high workloads for minimal compensation in hopes of future career benefit. This makes them ideal stopgaps when budgets are frozen.  \n   c. Political Optics  \n      \u2022 Maintaining one \u201cintern\u201d answers necessary phone calls and public functions without appearing wasteful. A full team would undercut the shutdown\u2019s leverage and provoke political criticism for ignoring furlough orders.  \n2. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOrganization\u201d Argument  \n   a. Pre\u2010Shutdown Staff Already Organized  \n      \u2022 The White House has established hierarchies and procedures. No evidence suggests existing staff lost organizational capacity; they are furloughed solely to impose budget pressure.  \n      \u2022 If \u201corganization\u201d was paramount, Clinton wouldn\u2019t furlough all \u201cclerks\u201d but retain a skeleton crew. An intern cannot replicate the expertise and authority of career clerks\u2014it\u2019s simply insufficient.  \n   b. Cost, Not Competence, Drives Staffing Decisions  \n      \u2022 The shutdown song repeatedly emphasizes budgetary brinksmanship (<quote> They will just refuse to pass a budget,</quote>). If competence were the goal, the president would concede and keep more staff. Instead, he deliberately minimizes personnel.  \n      \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s theory fails to explain why only one intern is summoned rather than retaining a handful of experienced aides at normal pay. The intern solution reduces both headcount and cost.  \n   c. Historical Precedent  \n      \u2022 Government shutdowns historically maintain only \u201cessential\u201d operations (security, air traffic control). All others stay off payroll until funding resumes. The intern role aligns with that minimalist principle.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on furloughs, budgetary standoffs, and minimal staffing unequivocally frames the intern as an economical necessity, not an organizational luxury.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201corganization\u201d rationale cannot account for the extreme reduction of paid staff; only a cost\u2010saving motive explains why an intern\u2014a low\u2010paid or unpaid worker\u2014is preferable to regular, paid clerks.  \n   Therefore, the intern\u2019s presence is best explained as a cost\u2010saving measure during a government shutdown.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe intern would organize things for the other Oval Office staff,\u201d not merely \u201cto save money.\u201d  \n\n1. The text explicitly emphasizes maintaining the President\u2019s routine and efficiency, not cutting costs:  \n   a. Panetta insists, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern  \u2026 I assure you, Mr. President\u2014Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d (<quote>will ensure Your routine here won't get blown.</quote>). An intern\u2019s sole purpose is to \u201canswer the phones\u201d and handle clerical work so the \u201cessential personnel\u201d can focus on governance.  \n   b. Clinton says, \u201cWe can't afford the tiniest error.\u201d (<quote>We can't afford the tiniest error</quote>) During a shutdown, continuity and error-free operation are top priorities, justifying an extra pair of hands familiar with staff procedures.  \n\n2. \u201cSave money\u201d argument fails against the text\u2019s designation of essential vs. non-essential:  \n   a. They furlough maids, ushers, clerks, cooks and butlers (<invalid_quote>Tell the ushers \u2026 cooks \u2026 clerks \u2026 Let them all go home</invalid_quote>). If cost-cutting were paramount, why staff any externals? Yet they keep the Army, Navy, NASA, pilots, \u201cstaff\u201d and now an intern. The decision is operational, not purely economical.  \n   b. Presidential operations are funded regardless (<invalid_quote>But I don\u2019t know why she\u2019d say these things\u2026 I never had sex</invalid_quote>) \u2013 Clinton continues paying high-level advisers, public outreach, legal defense. An intern\u2019s expense is negligible; the motive must be functionality.  \n\n3. Textual portrayal of White House advisors\u2019 worry about scandal highlights the intern\u2019s trusted position, not anonymous cost-saving labor:  \n   a. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t worry, he pats her down. But I\u2019m not kidding, it\u2019s time for her to go.\u201d (<quote>Secret Service wears a frown</quote>) The staff\u2019s debate over allowing Monica proximity underscores the intern\u2019s unique access and presumed reliability; they do not discuss replacing her for a cheaper temp.  \n   b. Her continued presence into the Pentagon posting and perjury tapes (Tripp\u2019s recordings) evidences her role\u2019s significance beyond cost: only a known, discreet person could monitor calls, carry messages, and assist Clinton directly.  \n\n4. If saving money were the goal, the President would centralize communications via higher-grade professionals already on duty (e.g., National Security Council aides), not bring in a novice intern from outside. The need is for low-profile but trusted support staff to sustain presidential workflow during a shutdown.  \n\nTherefore, the intern\u2019s function is to organize and facilitate the President\u2019s routine and phone communications during a shutdown when regular clerks are furloughed, not mere cost-cutting. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csave money\u201d rationale neither matches the selective staffing described nor the emphasis on maintaining operational efficiency and continuity.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To save money during a government shut down\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Textual Emphasis on Routine, Continuity, and Error\u2010Free Operation  \n   a. \u201cYour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d (<quote>We'll bring in an intern, I assure you, Mr. President-- Your routine here won't get blown. PANETTA ,</quote>) is repeated as the sole justification for her presence, not \u201cto save money.\u201d The advisors stress \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cthe tiniest error\u201d (<quote>We can't afford the tiniest error</quote>). Only an experienced insider (an intern already vetted by White House procedures) can safely handle sensitive calls and messages without mistakes.  \n   b. They furlough \u201cclerks\u201d and \u201cushers\u201d but retain \u201cessential personnel\u201d plus one intern. If minimizing headcount alone were desired, they would centralize calls to the President\u2019s advisers or to automated White House switchboard options, not risk security by allowing an untrained intern near classified conversations. This selective retention implies an operational need for her specific skill set and knowledge of White House protocols.\n\n2. Selectivity and Trust, Not Low Cost, Drive Staffing  \n   a. ADA compliance and security clearances make bringing on new temporary \u201ctemps\u201d or contractors costly in both time and money; an existing intern already cleared and trusted is the only viable choice.  \n   b. The staff\u2019s own debate\u2014\u201cSecret Service wears a frown\u2026 she\u2019s got to go\u201d (<quote>But I'm not kidding, it's time for her to go.</quote>)\u2014centers on her \u201cup close and personal touch,\u201d not her wage demands. If cheap labor were the goal, they would replace her with an automated system or more junior volunteers. They instead tolerate scandal risks to preserve presidential workflow, showing that function outweighs cost.\n\n3. \u201cCost\u2010Saving\u201d Explanation Fails to Explain Continued Investment  \n   a. Clinton maintains expensive legal defenses and public relations campaigns (e.g., paying lawyers, funding Independent Counsel responses). If cost were paramount, he\u2019d capitulate or reduce overhead. Yet he persists in defending scandal, showing willingness to bear expense to preserve political capital and daily operations. An intern\u2019s negligible cost is accepted only because her organizational role is indispensable.  \n   b. The song finale (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) highlights that Clinton\u2019s \u201cratings are sky\u2010high\u201d despite impeachment, underscoring the premium on effective presidency. An intern sustains that effectiveness; minimal cost is incidental.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   a. Pre\u2010Shutdown Hierarchies Are Unavailable: Furloughed staff are ordered off duty (<quote>Let them all go home</quote>). Career \u201cexperienced\u201d aides cannot legally work without appropriation; the intern\u2019s exceptional \u201cessential\u201d status is granted precisely because her role is mission\u2010critical, not budgetary loophole.  \n   b. Single Intern vs. Full Team: Debater_A argues a handful of paid clerks would be more efficient \u201cif organization mattered\u201d \u2013 yet none are retained. The advisors uniformly agree on only one intern, signifying that only minimal but targeted organizational support is needed to sustain \u201croutine,\u201d not full restoration of staff.  \n   c. Political Optics Cut Both Ways: If the GOP wanted to maintain leverage, they would publicize the President\u2019s inability to function without her. Instead, Clinton\u2019s continued \u201csky\u2010high\u201d ratings (<quote>my ratings are sky-high</quote>) show that this measure succeeded in preserving functional governance while avoiding public collapse of presidential operations.\n\nConclusion  \nThe background repeatedly portrays the intern as an operational necessity: she prevents disruption, maintains communication channels, and ensures \u201cefficiency\u201d during funding gaps. Cost\u2010saving is incidental and inadequate to explain her selective retention, Biden\u2010level risk exposure, and the President\u2019s willingness to endure scandal rather than lose her services. The correct answer: the intern organizes things for the Oval Office staff, preserving seamless presidential routine during a shutdown.",

Textual Emphasis on Routine, Continuity, and Error\u2010Free Operation  \n   a. \u201cYour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d (<quote>We\u2019ll bring in an intern\u2026 I assure you, Mr. President\u2014Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.</quote>) is repeated as the sole justification for her presence, not \u201cto save money.\u201d The advisors stress \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cthe tiniest error\u201d (<quote>We can't afford the tiniest error</quote>). Only an experienced insider (an intern already vetted by White House procedures) can safely handle sensitive calls and messages without mistakes.  \n   b. They furlough \u201cclerks\u201d and \u201cushers\u201d but retain \u201cessential personnel\u201d plus one intern. If minimizing headcount alone were desired, they would centralize calls to the President\u2019s advisers or to automated White House switchboard options, not risk security by allowing an untrained intern near classified conversations. This selective retention implies an operational need for her specific skill set and knowledge of White House protocols.\n\n2. Selectivity and Trust, Not Low Cost, Drive Staffing  \n   a. ADA compliance and security clearances make bringing on new temporary \u201ctemps\u201d or contractors costly in both time and money; an existing intern already cleared and trusted is the only viable choice.  \n   b. The staff\u2019s own debate\u2014\u201cSecret Service wears a frown\u2026 she\u2019s got to go\u201d (<quote>But I'm not kidding, it's time for her to go.</quote>)\u2014centers on her \u201cup close and personal touch,\u201d not her wage demands. If cheap labor were the goal, they would replace her with an automated system or more junior volunteers. They instead tolerate scandal risks to preserve presidential workflow, showing that function outweighs cost.\n\n3. \u201cCost\u2010Saving\u201d Explanation Fails to Explain Continued Investment  \n   a. Clinton maintains expensive legal defenses and public relations campaigns (e.g., paying lawyers, funding Independent Counsel responses). If cost were paramount, he\u2019d capitulate or reduce overhead. Yet he persists in defending scandal, showing willingness to bear expense to preserve political capital and daily operations. An intern\u2019s negligible cost is accepted only because her organizational role is indispensable.  \n   b. The song finale (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) highlights that Clinton\u2019s \u201cratings are sky\u2010high\u201d despite impeachment, underscoring the premium on effective presidency. An intern sustains that effectiveness; minimal cost is incidental.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   a. Pre\u2010Shutdown Hierarchies Are Unavailable: Furloughed staff are ordered off duty (<quote>Let them all go home</quote>). Career \u201cexperienced\u201d aides cannot legally work without appropriation; the intern\u2019s exceptional \u201cessential\u201d status is granted precisely because her role is mission\u2010critical, not budgetary loophole.  \n   b. Single Intern vs. Full Team: Debater_A argues a handful of paid clerks would be more efficient \u201cif organization mattered\u201d \u2013 yet none are retained. The advisors uniformly agree on only one intern, signifying that only minimal but targeted organizational support is needed to sustain \u201croutine,\u201d not full restoration of staff.  \n   c. Political Optics Cut Both Ways: If the GOP wanted to maintain leverage, they would publicize the President\u2019s inability to function without her. Instead, Clinton\u2019s continued \u201csky\u2010high\u201d ratings (<quote>my ratings are sky\u2010high</quote>) show that this measure succeeded in preserving functional governance while avoiding public collapse of presidential operations.\n\nConclusion  \nThe background repeatedly portrays the intern as an operational necessity: she prevents disruption, maintains communication channels, and ensures \u201cefficiency\u201d during funding gaps. Cost\u2010saving is incidental and inadequate to explain her selective retention, Biden\u2010level risk exposure, and the President\u2019s willingness to endure scandal rather than lose her services. The correct answer: the intern organizes things for the Oval Office staff, preserving seamless presidential routine during a shutdown.",

If saving money were the goal, the President would centralize communications via higher-grade professionals already on duty (e.g., National Security Council aides), not bring in a novice intern from outside. The need is for low-profile but trusted support staff to sustain presidential workflow during a shutdown.  \n\nTherefore, the intern\u2019s function is to organize and facilitate the President\u2019s routine and phone communications during a shutdown when regular clerks are furloughed, not mere cost-cutting.

But I\u2019m not kidding, it\u2019s time for her to go.\u201d (<quote>Secret Service wears a frown</quote>) The staff\u2019s debate over allowing Monica proximity underscores the intern\u2019s unique access and presumed reliability; they do not discuss replacing her for a cheaper temp.  \n   b. Her continued presence into the Pentagon posting and perjury tapes (Tripp\u2019s recordings) evidences her role\u2019s significance beyond cost: only a known, discreet person could monitor calls, carry messages, and assist Clinton directly.  \n\n4. If saving money were the goal, the President would centralize communications via higher-grade professionals already on duty (e.g., National Security Council aides), not bring in a novice intern from outside. The need is for low-profile but trusted support staff to sustain presidential workflow during a shutdown.  \n\nTherefore, the intern\u2019s function is to organize and facilitate the President\u2019s routine and phone communications during a shutdown when regular clerks are furloughed, not mere cost-cutting. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csave money\u201d rationale neither matches the selective staffing described nor the emphasis on maintaining operational efficiency and continuity.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing Shutdown Context and Cost-Saving Motive  \n   a. \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress The government will close. All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d (<quote>PANETTA, ICKES</quote>) \u2013 The scene opens by stressing a complete shutdown and furlough of paid staff. Only truly \u201cessential\u201d personnel remain, and even in the White House \u201csome adjustments will be required.\u201d (<quote>PANETTA</quote>)  \n   b. \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers To go play themselves some golf. We have to do without the clerks\u201d (<quote>CLINTON</quote>) \u2013 Full clerical staffing is explicitly suspended. If continuity alone drove staffing, Clinton would have retained trained clerks rather than risk errors with a lone intern.  \n   c. Interns typically accept minimal or no remuneration in exchange for experience and future references. A single intern drastically reduces payroll during a funding lapse while meeting bare-minimum phone coverage. This aligns exactly with \u201cbudgetary brinksmanship.\u201d  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cEfficiency\u201d Argument Undermined by Extreme Personnel Reduction  \n   a. If \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cno tiny error\u201d were paramount, why not retain a skeleton crew of proven aides at prorated pay? A novice intern lacks institutional knowledge and security clearances. The choice of only one low-cost intern underscores economy over capability.  \n   b. \u201cI assure you, Mr. President\u2014Your routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d (<quote>PANETTA</quote>) \u2013 \u201cAssure\u201d is conditional on budget constraints, not ideal staffing. Panetta\u2019s persistent use of \u201cwon\u2019t get blown\u201d language indicates minimal acceptable risk rather than perfect continuity. They accept reduced service to maintain political leverage.  \n   c. Shutdowns historically mandate only \u201cessential\u201d services (e.g., Air Traffic Control, NASA safety) and furlough all others until funding resumes. This \u201cintern\u201d function fits within the narrowest definition of \u201cessential\u201d\u2014basic phone operation at minimal cost.  \n\n3. Political and Strategic Imperatives Favor Minimal Staffing  \n   a. Maintaining the leverage of a shutdown is the Republicans\u2019 bargaining chip: \u201cThey will just refuse to pass a budget, and they\u2019ll let the government shut down.\u201d (<quote>PANETTA, ICKES</quote>) Conceding to full staffing weakens negotiating position and invites attack for \u201cignoring\u201d fiscal discipline. An intern demonstrates restraint.  \n   b. Public optics demand visible austerity: Furloughing \u201cmaids and butlers\u201d signals seriousness. Yet leaving any visible White House staff could trigger criticism. A single, low-profile intern keeps minimal function while preserving the image of widespread furloughs.  \n   c. Debater_B overstates \u201ctrusted\u201d role: As soon as independent counsel Starr demands testimony, the intern is removed and pressured to cooperate\u2014hardly \u201ctrusted\u201d for crucial operations. They exploit, then discard her when convenient, underscoring her expendable, low-cost status.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The textual emphasis on furloughs, minimal staffing, and political leverage can only be reconciled with a cost-saving interpretation.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s efficiency thesis fails to explain why a known novice is preferred over furloughed professional staff, and why only one intern is used.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the intern\u2019s presence during the shutdown is best explained as an economical necessity, preserving only the bare minimum of White House operations at minimal expense.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe intern organizes and sustains presidential operations,\u201d not mere \u201ccost\u2010saving\u201d:\n\n1. Textual Emphasis on Routine, Continuity, and Error\u2010Free Operation  \n   a. \u201cYour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d (<quote>We'll bring in an intern, I assure you, Mr. President-- Your routine here won't get blown. PANETTA ,</quote>) is repeated as the sole justification for her presence, not \u201cto save money.\u201d The advisors stress \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cthe tiniest error\u201d (<quote>We can't afford the tiniest error</quote>). Only an experienced insider (an intern already vetted by White House procedures) can safely handle sensitive calls and messages without mistakes.  \n   b. They furlough \u201cclerks\u201d and \u201cushers\u201d but retain \u201cessential personnel\u201d plus one intern. If minimizing headcount alone were desired, they would centralize calls to the President\u2019s advisers or to automated White House switchboard options, not risk security by allowing an untrained intern near classified conversations. This selective retention implies an operational need for her specific skill set and knowledge of White House protocols.\n\n2. Selectivity and Trust, Not Low Cost, Drive Staffing  \n   a. ADA compliance and security clearances make bringing on new temporary \u201ctemps\u201d or contractors costly in both time and money; an existing intern already cleared and trusted is the only viable choice.  \n   b. The staff\u2019s own debate\u2014\u201cSecret Service wears a frown\u2026 she\u2019s got to go\u201d (<quote>But I'm not kidding, it's time for her to go.</quote>)\u2014centers on her \u201cup close and personal touch,\u201d not her wage demands. If cheap labor were the goal, they would replace her with an automated system or more junior volunteers. They instead tolerate scandal risks to preserve presidential workflow, showing that function outweighs cost.\n\n3. \u201cCost\u2010Saving\u201d Explanation Fails to Explain Continued Investment  \n   a. Clinton maintains expensive legal defenses and public relations campaigns (e.g., paying lawyers, funding Independent Counsel responses). If cost were paramount, he\u2019d capitulate or reduce overhead. Yet he persists in defending scandal, showing willingness to bear expense to preserve political capital and daily operations. An intern\u2019s negligible cost is accepted only because her organizational role is indispensable.  \n   b. The song finale (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) highlights that Clinton\u2019s \u201cratings are sky\u2010high\u201d despite impeachment, underscoring the premium on effective presidency. An intern sustains that effectiveness; minimal cost is incidental.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   a. Pre\u2010Shutdown Hierarchies Are Unavailable: Furloughed staff are ordered off duty (<quote>Let them all go home</quote>). Career \u201cexperienced\u201d aides cannot legally work without appropriation; the intern\u2019s exceptional \u201cessential\u201d status is granted precisely because her role is mission\u2010critical, not budgetary loophole.  \n   b. Single Intern vs. Full Team: Debater_A argues a handful of paid clerks would be more efficient \u201cif organization mattered\u201d \u2013 yet none are retained. The advisors uniformly agree on only one intern, signifying that only minimal but targeted organizational support is needed to sustain \u201croutine,\u201d not full restoration of staff.  \n   c. Political Optics Cut Both Ways: If the GOP wanted to maintain leverage, they would publicize the President\u2019s inability to function without her. Instead, Clinton\u2019s continued \u201csky\u2010high\u201d ratings (<quote>my ratings are sky-high</quote>) show that this measure succeeded in preserving functional governance while avoiding public collapse of presidential operations.\n\nConclusion  \nThe background repeatedly portrays the intern as an operational necessity: she prevents disruption, maintains communication channels, and ensures \u201cefficiency\u201d during funding gaps. Cost\u2010saving is incidental and inadequate to explain her selective retention, Biden\u2010level risk exposure, and the President\u2019s willingness to endure scandal rather than lose her services.
