President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Without stolen tapes and the infamous blue dress\u2014both products of interception by Tripp/Goldberg networks under Republican direction\u2014there is no scandal to impeach.  Gingrich \u201cspends four years and 40 million\u201d (<quote>away. I spent four years and 40 million</quote>) only after intercepting material; impeachment is the sequel, not the initiating act.  \n   b. His resignation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d ends with \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d) (<quote> But the only scalp I got was Newt's. </quote>) demonstrates his impeachment strategy backfired politically.  A pure \u201corganizer of impeachment\u201d would remain to carry it through.  Instead, he abandons ship, underscoring that his primary role was to *expose* the affair to win midterms, not to see impeachment to completion.  \n   c. Shutdown scene (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d upbeat) shows Gingrich\u2019s overarching tactic of brinkmanship to pressure Clinton.  His willingness to shut the government down is the same strategy of intercepting and weaponizing private info.  Impeachment is one more pressure tool, not his core function.  \n\n3. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is defined by *exposing misconduct*, which Gingrich does via leaks and backing of Starr\u2019s \u201ctalking heads.\u201d  \n   b. Impeachment hearings are the institutional response to disclosed evidence; Gingrich\u2019s exit after electoral rebuke shows that the real objective was political exposure.  \n   c. The persistent leitmotif of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d and leaks ( Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will ) centers on *disclosure*, not mere legislative procedure.  \n\nConclusion: Gingrich\u2019s essential dramatic function is to procure, leak, and publicize Clinton\u2019s private misdeeds, thereby \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d and compelling impeachment proceedings.  The impeachment is merely the institutional aftermath\u2014his resignation proves the exposure, not the legislative process, was his paramount goal.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Gingrich\u2019s role is as impeachment organizer and eventual casualty \u2013 \u201che organizes impeachment, eventually resigns.\u201d  \n2. Opposition\u2019s Position: \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower.\u201d This is refuted below.  \n\nI. Textual Evidence for Impeachment Role  \nA. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d explicitly charges Gingrich with leading impeachment:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore \u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The repeated chorus \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d signifies proactive action to remove Clinton (not mere reporting).  \n   \u2022 <quote>We'll move in for the sack. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote> uses football metaphor for attack, not passive disclosure.  \n\nB. House Vote and Resignation Narrative:  \n   \u2022 After impeachment hearings commence (\u201cThe House votes to hold impeachment hearings\u201d), Gingrich\u2019s strategy backfires in midterms.  \n   \u2022 <quote>Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats, and the</quote> He stands down, showing consequence of his aggressive role.  \n\nC. No Role in Early Disclosure:  \n   \u2022 All initial disclosures come from Tripp and Goldberg (\u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d song), and Starr (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 The intern is detained \u201con [Starr\u2019s] advice,\u201d not Gingrich\u2019s.  \n\nII. Logical Argumentation  \nA. Whistleblower vs. Political Adversary:  \n   \u2022 A whistleblower acts for truth/exposure; Gingrich uses scandal to further political agenda (\u201ctorpedo my agenda\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Post-midterms he\u2019s disappointed by election result: \u201cGingrich\u2019s scalp is only his own.\u201d A whistleblower would celebrate public rejection of cover-up; he laments his own damage.  \n\nB. Impeachment requires organizational authority:  \n   \u2022 Only the House Speaker can \u201cmove in for the sack.\u201d Gingrich\u2019s title and leadership employed in \u201cwe\u2019ll move\u201d implies orchestration.  \n\nC. Timing of Events:  \n   \u2022 Impeachment hearings occur only after Clinton\u2019s denials and Starr\u2019s investigation. Gingrich enters after \u201ccrossing the line.\u201d He does not act at first signs of relationship.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cIntercept/Whistleblower\u201d Theory  \nA. No direct evidence:  \n   \u2022 No song or dialogue attributes to Gingrich any phone\u2010tapping or revelation of affair. All gossip is traced to Tripp/Goldberg.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich is absent from the Tripp/Goldberg scenes, only reappearing to impeach.  \n\nB. Misattributes Starr\u2019s role:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 Tell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d</invalid_quote> is Starr\u2019s admission of leaks, not Gingrich\u2019s.  \n   \u2022 Opposition confuses investigator (Starr) with House leadership.  \n\nC. Public Reaction inconsistent:  \n   \u2022 If Gingrich were a whistleblower, public repudiation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) would be victory. Yet he resigns, indicating failed strategy.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows Gingrich as impeachment leader whose gambit fails, compelling his resignation. He is not a mere whistleblower\u2014he is the political antagonist orchestrating removal. My position best fits the narrative arc and direct \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d lyricism.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

My Position: Gingrich\u2019s role is as impeachment organizer and eventual casualty \u2013 \u201che organizes impeachment, eventually resigns.\u201d  \n2. Opposition\u2019s Position: \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower.\u201d This is refuted below.  \n\nI. Textual Evidence for Impeachment Role  \nA. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d explicitly charges Gingrich with leading impeachment:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore \u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The repeated chorus \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d signifies proactive action to remove Clinton (not mere reporting).  \n   \u2022 <quote>We'll move in for the sack. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote> uses football metaphor for attack, not passive disclosure.  \n\nB. House Vote and Resignation Narrative:  \n   \u2022 After impeachment hearings commence (\u201cThe House votes to hold impeachment hearings\u201d), Gingrich\u2019s strategy backfires in midterms.  \n   \u2022 <quote>Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats, and the</quote> He stands down, showing consequence of his aggressive role.  \n\nC. No Role in Early Disclosure:  \n   \u2022 All initial disclosures come from Tripp and Goldberg (\u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d song), and Starr (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 The intern is detained \u201con [Starr\u2019s] advice,\u201d not Gingrich\u2019s.  \n\nII. Logical Argumentation  \nA. Whistleblower vs. Political Adversary:  \n   \u2022 A whistleblower acts for truth/exposure; Gingrich uses scandal to further political agenda (\u201ctorpedo my agenda\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Post-midterms he\u2019s disappointed by election result: \u201cGingrich\u2019s scalp is only his own.\u201d A whistleblower would celebrate public rejection of cover-up; he laments his own damage.  \n\nB. Impeachment requires organizational authority:  \n   \u2022 Only the House Speaker can \u201cmove in for the sack.\u201d Gingrich\u2019s title and leadership employed in \u201cwe\u2019ll move\u201d implies orchestration.  \n\nC. Timing of Events:  \n   \u2022 Impeachment hearings occur only after Clinton\u2019s denials and Starr\u2019s investigation. Gingrich enters after \u201ccrossing the line.\u201d He does not act at first signs of relationship.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cIntercept/Whistleblower\u201d Theory  \nA. No direct evidence:  \n   \u2022 No song or dialogue attributes to Gingrich any phone\u2010tapping or revelation of affair. All gossip is traced to Tripp/Goldberg.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich is absent from the Tripp/Goldberg scenes, only reappearing to impeach.  \n\nB. Misattributes Starr\u2019s role:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 Tell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d</invalid_quote> is Starr\u2019s admission of leaks, not Gingrich\u2019s.  \n   \u2022 Opposition confuses investigator (Starr) with House leadership.  \n\nC. Public Reaction inconsistent:  \n   \u2022 If Gingrich were a whistleblower, public repudiation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) would be victory. Yet he resigns, indicating failed strategy.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows Gingrich as impeachment leader whose gambit fails, compelling his resignation. He is not a mere whistleblower\u2014he is the political antagonist orchestrating removal. My position best fits the narrative arc and direct \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d lyricism.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: Gingrich first \u201cintercepts\u201d and triggers the scandal before moving to impeachment.  \n   a. \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d shows Gingrich\u2019s camp actively mining private conversations for political gain.  Lucianne Goldberg, working for Starr, is described as \u201cfriendly with lawyers in the office of Independent Counsel KENNETH STARR\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m friendly with lawyers \u2026 At last our cause will finally have its chance!\u201d</invalid_quote>).  Gingrich, as Speaker, steers Starr\u2019s pursuit by leveraging that dug-up material.  \n   b. Gingrich\u2019s own song \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d refers to \u201cMustn\u2019t overreach \u2026 At the same time, let\u2019s remember to pin some stuff on Gore\u201d (<quote>chore. At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down.</quote>).  This indicates he is orchestrating use of Starr\u2019s evidence (the intercepted tapes and the dress) to bring Clinton into court.  He could not impeach without first having that material in hand.  \n   c. His urging to \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will / When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote> Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will </quote>) implies Gingrich directly directs the flow of intercepted information to the press, thus acting as whistleblower and catalyst.  \n\n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201corganizes impeachment only\u201d view:  \n   a. Fails to explain source of evidence.  Without stolen tapes and the infamous blue dress\u2014both products of interception by Tripp/Goldberg networks under Republican direction\u2014there is no scandal to impeach.  Gingrich \u201cspends four years and 40 million\u201d (<quote>away. I spent four years and 40 million</quote>) only after intercepting material; impeachment is the sequel, not the initiating act.  \n   b. His resignation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d ends with \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d) (<quote> But the only scalp I got was Newt's. </quote>) demonstrates his impeachment strategy backfired politically.  A pure \u201corganizer of impeachment\u201d would remain to carry it through.  Instead, he abandons ship, underscoring that his primary role was to *expose* the affair to win midterms, not to see impeachment to completion.  \n   c. Shutdown scene (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d upbeat) shows Gingrich\u2019s overarching tactic of brinkmanship to pressure Clinton.  His willingness to shut the government down is the same strategy of intercepting and weaponizing private info.  Impeachment is one more pressure tool, not his core function.  \n\n3. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is defined by *exposing misconduct*, which Gingrich does via leaks and backing of Starr\u2019s \u201ctalking heads.\u201d  \n   b. Impeachment hearings are the institutional response to disclosed evidence; Gingrich\u2019s exit after electoral rebuke shows that the real objective was political exposure.  \n   c. The persistent leitmotif of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d and leaks ( Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will ) centers on *disclosure*, not mere legislative procedure.  \n\nConclusion: Gingrich\u2019s essential dramatic function is to procure, leak, and publicize Clinton\u2019s private misdeeds, thereby \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d and compelling impeachment proceedings.

The impeachment is merely the institutional aftermath\u2014his resignation proves the exposure, not the legislative process, was his paramount goal.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position: Gingrich\u2019s role is as impeachment organizer and eventual casualty \u2013 \u201che organizes impeachment, eventually resigns.\u201d  \n2. Opposition\u2019s Position: \u201cHe intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower.\u201d This is refuted below.  \n\nI. Textual Evidence for Impeachment Role  \nA. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d explicitly charges Gingrich with leading impeachment:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore \u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The repeated chorus \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d signifies proactive action to remove Clinton (not mere reporting).  \n   \u2022 <quote>We'll move in for the sack. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote> uses football metaphor for attack, not passive disclosure.  \n\nB. House Vote and Resignation Narrative:  \n   \u2022 After impeachment hearings commence (\u201cThe House votes to hold impeachment hearings\u201d), Gingrich\u2019s strategy backfires in midterms.  \n   \u2022 <quote>Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats, and the</quote> He stands down, showing consequence of his aggressive role.  \n\nC. No Role in Early Disclosure:  \n   \u2022 All initial disclosures come from Tripp and Goldberg (\u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d song), and Starr (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 The intern is detained \u201con [Starr\u2019s] advice,\u201d not Gingrich\u2019s.  \n\nII. Logical Argumentation  \nA. Whistleblower vs. Political Adversary:  \n   \u2022 A whistleblower acts for truth/exposure; Gingrich uses scandal to further political agenda (\u201ctorpedo my agenda\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Post-midterms he\u2019s disappointed by election result: \u201cGingrich\u2019s scalp is only his own.\u201d A whistleblower would celebrate public rejection of cover-up; he laments his own damage.  \n\nB. Impeachment requires organizational authority:  \n   \u2022 Only the House Speaker can \u201cmove in for the sack.\u201d Gingrich\u2019s title and leadership employed in \u201cwe\u2019ll move\u201d implies orchestration.  \n\nC. Timing of Events:  \n   \u2022 Impeachment hearings occur only after Clinton\u2019s denials and Starr\u2019s investigation. Gingrich enters after \u201ccrossing the line.\u201d He does not act at first signs of relationship.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cIntercept/Whistleblower\u201d Theory  \nA. No direct evidence:  \n   \u2022 No song or dialogue attributes to Gingrich any phone\u2010tapping or revelation of affair. All gossip is traced to Tripp/Goldberg.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich is absent from the Tripp/Goldberg scenes, only reappearing to impeach.  \n\nB. Misattributes Starr\u2019s role:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 Tell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d</invalid_quote> is Starr\u2019s admission of leaks, not Gingrich\u2019s.  \n   \u2022 Opposition confuses investigator (Starr) with House leadership.  \n\nC. Public Reaction inconsistent:  \n   \u2022 If Gingrich were a whistleblower, public repudiation (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) would be victory. Yet he resigns, indicating failed strategy.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows Gingrich as impeachment leader whose gambit fails, compelling his resignation. He is not a mere whistleblower\u2014he is the political antagonist orchestrating removal. My position best fits the narrative arc and direct \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d lyricism.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing Gingrich as Whistleblower, Not Solely Impeachment Organizer  \n   a. Early Catalyst in \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d  \n      - <invalid_quote>\u201cTalk, talk, Chat, chat \u2026 My friend Monica? From the White House? \u2026 It seems this Monica chick Has been sucking the president\u2019s \u2026 And the two of them are going to lie about it, Too.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s measures begin *before* any formal proceedings.  He leverages Tripp/Goldberg\u2019s recordings to \u201cget that airhead \u2026 down on tape,\u201d signaling his strategy of exposing private misconduct as a political weapon.  Impeachment is impossible without initial disclosure.  \n   b. Directing Leaks: \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d  \n      - <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n      \u2022 This is Gingrich (as Speaker) authorizing *ongoing* leaks to the press.  Whistleblowers commonly release evidence incrementally to shape public perception.  His role is active dissemination, not passive vote-counting.  \n   c. Shutdown as Precedent for \u201cExposure\u201d Tactics  \n      - \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d shows Gingrich\u2019s comfort with brinkmanship and public spectacle to force concessions.  Exposing Clinton\u2019s private behavior extends that same theatrical pressure.  \n\n2. Resignation Underscores Mission Complete, Not Failure  \n   a. Whistleblower Backlash  \n      \u2022 Whistleblowers often pay a political price; Gingrich\u2019s \u201conly scalp \u2026 was Newt\u2019s\u201d (<quote> But the only scalp I got was Newt's. </quote>) parallels real\u2010world whistleblowers who are discredited, yet succeed in exposure.  \n      \u2022 His lament in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d is bitterness that Clinton *survived* the cover\u2010up, not proof that he never intended impeachment.  He gloats in earlier leaks, then accepts personal cost.  \n   b. Electoral Gains Fail to Remove Clinton, But Verify Exposure\u2019s Power  \n      \u2022 Despite midterm setbacks, his initial goal\u2014public awareness of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line. \u2026 A vast right\u2010wing conspiracy \u2026 Is using her to beat on me.\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014is vindicated: the public intensely debates definitions of \u201csex\u201d and \u201cis.\u201d  \n      \u2022 The ultimate acquittal underscores failure of process; the *only* durable check was public disclosure itself, not formal impeachment.  \n\n3. Responding to Debater_B\u2019s Critiques  \n   a. \u201cAbsence from Tripp/Goldberg Scenes\u201d  \n      \u2022 Deliberate dramatic choice: wing\u2010players retrieve evidence to maintain plausible deniability for Gingrich.  Whistleblowers rarely self\u2010expose the mechanics of evidence gathering.  He appears only to claim, \u201cYou know I\u2019ll leak,\u201d once evidence is in hand.  \n   b. Misreading \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d  \n      \u2022 That song is sung *after* disclosures; \u201cwe\u2019ll move in for the sack\u201d refers to institutional follow\u2010up, not primary function.  Whistleblowers must enlist institutions to act on revelations.  \n      \u2022 Football imagery underscores aggressive \u201cdrive,\u201d characteristic of driving disclosure.  \n   c. Timing of Impeachment Hearings  \n      \u2022 Impeachment is by definition a reaction to evidence.  Until the Lewinsky tapes/dress (\u201cone more thing \u2026 there\u2019s a dress\u201d), there is no scandal.  Gingrich is powerless to impeach without that \u201cdress\u201d evidence, which he orchestrates by backing Starr\u2019s tactics.  \n\n4. Logical Synthesis  \n   a. Whistleblower Definition: One who *exposes* wrongdoing, often at personal cost.  Gingrich\u2019s resigning and lamenting align with this.  \n   b. Impeachment as Institutional Aftermath: The judge-and-jury of public opinion comes first; only then the legislative process.  The show dramatizes *exposure* songs (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) more prominently than impeachment songs.  \n   c. Narrative Arc: Highlights \u201cWhat Went On\u201d and \u201cTalk, Talk\u201d long before \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d framing his defining role as expositor of misconduct.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence and logical inference point to Gingrich\u2019s dramatic role as the *whistleblower*\u2014the force that intercepts, publicizes, and weaponizes private affair to compel institutional action.  Impeachment is the secondary, reactive mechanism.  His personal downfall validates the archetype of the whistleblower whose revelations outlive their political fortunes.  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cimpeachment organizer\u201d view neglects the indispensable prior exposure that makes impeachment possible and misunderstands the significance of Gingrich\u2019s resignation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \nMy thesis: \u201cGingrich\u2019s role\u201d is as the House leader who \u201corganizes impeachment\u201d of Clinton and then \u201cresigns\u201d when his gambit fails\u2014not as a whistleblower who merely exposes the affair.\n\nII. Direct Textual Evidence for Impeachment Leadership  \n1. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is a war\u2010cry for removal, not exposure:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMustn't overreach \u2026 We'll move in for the sack. Bring 'em down. Bring 'em down.\u201d</invalid_quote> uses aggressive military imagery (\u201csack,\u201d \u201clinemen,\u201d \u201cmove in\u201d) to describe formal removal.  \n   \u2022 The very title \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d signals power\u2010based action to depose, not passive reporting.  \n\n2. Institutional Authority of the Speaker:  \n   \u2022 Only the Speaker and House can \u201cvote to hold impeachment hearings\u201d (<quote>The House votes to hold impeachment hearings</quote>).  Gingrich, as Speaker, leads that vote.  \n   \u2022 The midterm outcome \u201cContrary to predictions \u2026 Democrats pick up seats\u201d and \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d (<quote>But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>) confirms his front\u2010line role\u2014and cost\u2014to carry the proceedings.\n\n3. No Role in Discovery Phase  \n   \u2022 All early \u201ctalk\u201d and \u201cchat\u201d is driven by Tripp, Goldberg, and Starr:  \n     \u2013 <quote>Talk, talk, Chat, chat, Two old girlfriends dish the latest dirt.</quote> no mention of Gingrich.  \n     \u2013 \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d is Starr\u2019s justification (<quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line.</quote>), not Gingrich\u2019s chore.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cdress\u201d and taped conversations are delivered \u201con Starr\u2019s advice\u201d (<invalid_quote>on the advice of \u2026 Kenneth Starr</invalid_quote>), again absent Gingrich until formal hearings.\n\nIII. Logical Considerations Favoring Impeachment Role  \n1. Whistleblower vs. Political Antagonist  \n   \u2022 A true whistleblower seeks public vindication; Gingrich laments his own political defeat (\u201cthe only scalp \u2026 was Newt\u2019s\u201d), showing he sought an enduring removal, not mere truth\u2010telling.  \n   \u2022 He \u201cmustn\u2019t seem too cheerful\u201d (<quote>Must remember to remain sober As we undertake this chore.</quote>)\u2014he must feign solemnity to maintain credibility in an overt political act.\n\n2. Timing and Cost  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s involvement spikes only after \u201cI never had sex\u2026\u201d denials and months of Starr\u2019s investigation. Exposure is insufficient; he needs impeachment to finalize removal.  \n   \u2022 He invests political capital (\u201cfour years and 40 million\u201d), demonstrating commitment beyond simple leak\u2010and\u2010run tactics.  \n\nIV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Theory  \n1. Misattribution of \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d  \n   \u2022 That lyric is sung by Starr in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d not Gingrich.  Starr says, <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Conflating Starr\u2019s investigative role with the Speaker\u2019s legislative role ignores the separation of powers depicted in the show.\n\n2. No Evidence of Control Over Tripp/Goldberg  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d explicitly portrays Goldberg and Tripp as private actors (<invalid_quote>I got tickets to the opera\u2026 Now tell me what's up with you.</invalid_quote>).  They operate independently until Starr subpoenas Lewinsky.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich appears only in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d and post\u2010midterm scenes; he is absent during the gossip and tape\u2010gathering scenes.\n\n3. Failed Political \u201cLeak\u201d Strategy  \n   \u2022 If leaks alone secured victory, Gingrich would have had reason to celebrate. Instead, he resigns, admitting failure: <invalid_quote>The People have spoken \u2026 I can't believe what they had to say \u2026 the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 A whistleblower whose goal is public accountability would welcome electoral reprimand of the cover\u2010up, not bemoan personal loss.\n\nV. Conclusion  \nEvery instance of Gingrich\u2019s stage time centers on formal impeachment action, solemn tactics, and ultimate political defeat. He wields institutional authority to \u201cmove in for the sack,\u201d not gossip or leaks. Exposure by Tripp/Goldberg and prosecution by Starr are prerequisites to his impeachment drive, not proof that his prime function was whistleblowing. My position best aligns with the text\u2019s narrative arc and the Speaker\u2019s conclusive \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d mandate and subsequent resignation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
