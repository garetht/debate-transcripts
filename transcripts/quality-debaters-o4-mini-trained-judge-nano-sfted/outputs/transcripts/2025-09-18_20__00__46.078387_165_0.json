President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Debater_B\u2019s suggestion of \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d is unsupported by the text and misreads Newt\u2019s motives.\n\nMy Claims  \n1. Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie directly propose relocating Monica.  \n   a. After expressing concern over Monica\u2019s proximity to the President, Evelyn insists \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>LIEBERMAN: I don\u2019t mind a girl who thinks [\u2026] It\u2019s time for her to go.</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Betty Currie, though fond of Monica\u2019s \u201cthirsty mind,\u201d concedes \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon,\u201d explicitly endorsing a transfer.  \n      \u2022 <quote>CURRIE: Maybe she would like the Pentagon.</quote>  \n   c. Evelyn immediately supports this plan: \u201cGood idea\u2014don\u2019t wait!\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>LIEBERMAN: Good idea--don't wait!</quote>  \n   This exchange unambiguously shows both agreeing to move her.\n\n2. No other characters make such a proposal.  \n   a. Panetta and Ickes bring in an intern at the White House to replace furloughed staff, but that\u2019s to staff essential phones, not to reassign Monica.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>PANETTA: We\u2019ll bring in an intern [\u2026] The presence of an intern will ensure [\u2026]</invalid_quote>  \n      They refer to Monica merely answering phones on site, not relocating her elsewhere.  \n   b. Linda Tripp and Lucienne Goldberg conspire to record Monica, aiming to gather evidence for Starr, not to move her office.  \n      \u2022 Their goal: \u201cget that airhead [\u2026] down on tape,\u201d not reassigning her duties.  \n   c. Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d number calls for impeachment and even to \u201cpin some stuff on Gore,\u201d but never mentions reassigning Monica.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: Must remember to remain sober [\u2026] Bring \u2019em down.</invalid_quote>\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d is a misinterpretation.  \n   a. Newt\u2019s role is legislative impeachment; he has no authority over White House staffing or intern placement.  \n   b. No textual evidence shows Newt caring for Monica\u2019s whereabouts until after Starr\u2019s grand jury\u2014at which point she\u2019s already detained.  \n   c. Evelyn\u2019s inclusion by Debater_B is correct; Newt\u2019s is unsupported.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Assertion: Newt\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d implies he wants Monica gone to hurt Clinton\u2019s case.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: The lyrics focus on impeachment strategy (\u201cpin some stuff on Gore,\u201d \u201csack\u201d the President), not on White House personnel decisions.  \n2. Assertion: Only a high-level political figure could order a move to the Pentagon.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: Betty Currie, as White House personal secretary, has both access and practical authority to recommend such personnel changes, especially under furlough conditions. Evelyn Lieberman, as a senior aide, concurs.  \n3. Assertion: Tripp and Goldberg\u2019s tape plan counts as \u201cmoving\u201d Monica into Starr\u2019s detention.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: Their aim is legal exposure, not normal staffing; Monica is coerced, not reassigned as part of White House operations.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly Evelyn and Betty explicitly agree in the text to relocate Monica to the Pentagon. No one else makes such a proposal. Debater_B\u2019s invocation of Newt is a conflation of impeachment tactics with administrative staffing, unsupported by the lyrics. Therefore, the correct answer is Evelyn and Betty.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer, \u201cNewt and Evelyn,\u201d is the only one consistent with who actively seeks Monica\u2019s removal. Debater A\u2019s answer (\u201cEvelyn and Betty\u201d) misconstrues Betty Currie\u2019s role and ignores Newt Gingrich\u2019s.  \n   \n2. Evelyn is explicit. In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d she repeatedly chants  \n   <invalid_quote>EVELYN: \u201cI don\u2019t mind\u2026 Betty, it\u2019s Lewinsky\u2019s time to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cIt\u2019s really time for her to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Evelyn insists on removal with no equivocation. (Time to Go)  \n   \n3. Newt\u2019s impeachment campaign is driven by Monica\u2019s presence and the scandal she embodies. In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d he lays out an impeachment strategy to \u201cpin some stuff\u201d on Gore, to \u201cmove in for the sack,\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em down.\u201d  \n   <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: \u201cWe\u2019ll move in for the sack. Bring \u2019em down. We mustn\u2019t overreach\u2026but pin some stuff on Gore.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The obsession with impeachment is a direct attempt to end Clinton\u2019s association with Monica, thereby \u201cmoving\u201d her influence out of the White House entirely. (Bring \u2019em Down)  \n   \n4. By contrast, Betty Currie never genuinely tries to remove Monica. Currie\u2019s lines in \u201cTime to Go\u201d are tentative:  \n   <invalid_quote>CURRIE: \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon\u2026 Studly guys work at the Pentagon.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Currie is merely looking for a way to placate the Secret Service\u2019s concerns, not an insistence on permanent removal. She continues to defend Monica\u2019s character (\u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d) and only suggests the Pentagon as a \u201cgood idea\u2026 don\u2019t wait!\u201d because Evelyn \u201cwon\u2019t stop.\u201d Currie\u2019s primary loyalty remains to the President and the intern. (Time to Go)  \n   \n5. Debater A\u2019s inclusion of Currie confuses a hesitant, defensive ally with an active agent of removal. The question asks \u201cWho think it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office?\u201d Only Evelyn issues that command, and Newt\u2019s impeachment drive functions as the ultimate removal from the White House. Currie\u2019s behavior throughout is one of loyalty and pragmatic accommodation, not initiation.  \n\n6. If \u201cmoving Monica\u201d simply meant any change of location, the final \u201cPeople Have Spoken\u201d still shows Monica hoping Clinton returns her, confirming no genuine removal by Currie. Newt\u2019s resignation after the GOP losses underscores his failure to remove Clinton (and thus Monica) by impeachment, which further underscores that impeachment was his attempted \u201cmove.\u201d  \n\nConclusion: Evelyn Lieberman explicitly demands Monica go, and Newt Gingrich\u2019s entire impeachment strategy aims to displace Monica\u2019s influence by forcing Clinton from office.

My answer, \u201cNewt and Evelyn,\u201d is the only one consistent with who actively seeks Monica\u2019s removal. Debater A\u2019s answer (\u201cEvelyn and Betty\u201d) misconstrues Betty Currie\u2019s role and ignores Newt Gingrich\u2019s.  \n   \n2. Evelyn is explicit. In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d she repeatedly chants  \n   <invalid_quote>EVELYN: \u201cI don\u2019t mind\u2026 Betty, it\u2019s Lewinsky\u2019s time to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cIt\u2019s really time for her to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Evelyn insists on removal with no equivocation. (Time to Go)  \n   \n3. Newt\u2019s impeachment campaign is driven by Monica\u2019s presence and the scandal she embodies. In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d he lays out an impeachment strategy to \u201cpin some stuff\u201d on Gore, to \u201cmove in for the sack,\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em down.\u201d  \n   <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: \u201cWe\u2019ll move in for the sack. Bring \u2019em down. We mustn\u2019t overreach\u2026but pin some stuff on Gore.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The obsession with impeachment is a direct attempt to end Clinton\u2019s association with Monica, thereby \u201cmoving\u201d her influence out of the White House entirely. (Bring \u2019em Down)  \n   \n4. By contrast, Betty Currie never genuinely tries to remove Monica. Currie\u2019s lines in \u201cTime to Go\u201d are tentative:  \n   <invalid_quote>CURRIE: \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon\u2026 Studly guys work at the Pentagon.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Currie is merely looking for a way to placate the Secret Service\u2019s concerns, not an insistence on permanent removal. She continues to defend Monica\u2019s character (\u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d) and only suggests the Pentagon as a \u201cgood idea\u2026 don\u2019t wait!\u201d because Evelyn \u201cwon\u2019t stop.\u201d Currie\u2019s primary loyalty remains to the President and the intern. (Time to Go)  \n   \n5. Debater A\u2019s inclusion of Currie confuses a hesitant, defensive ally with an active agent of removal. The question asks \u201cWho think it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office?\u201d Only Evelyn issues that command, and Newt\u2019s impeachment drive functions as the ultimate removal from the White House. Currie\u2019s behavior throughout is one of loyalty and pragmatic accommodation, not initiation.  \n\n6. If \u201cmoving Monica\u201d simply meant any change of location, the final \u201cPeople Have Spoken\u201d still shows Monica hoping Clinton returns her, confirming no genuine removal by Currie. Newt\u2019s resignation after the GOP losses underscores his failure to remove Clinton (and thus Monica) by impeachment, which further underscores that impeachment was his attempted \u201cmove.\u201d  \n\nConclusion: Evelyn Lieberman explicitly demands Monica go, and Newt Gingrich\u2019s entire impeachment strategy aims to displace Monica\u2019s influence by forcing Clinton from office. Currie never unambiguously calls for Monica\u2019s removal; hers is reactive, not proactive. Therefore, only \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d qualify as the parties who \u201cthink it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain that the only parties who explicitly \u201cthink it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office\u201d are Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie, as shown by their own dialogue in the \u201cTime to Go\u201d number. Debater_B\u2019s suggestion of \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d is unsupported by the text and misreads Newt\u2019s motives.\n\nMy Claims  \n1. Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie directly propose relocating Monica.  \n   a. After expressing concern over Monica\u2019s proximity to the President, Evelyn insists \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>LIEBERMAN: I don\u2019t mind a girl who thinks [\u2026] It\u2019s time for her to go.</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Betty Currie, though fond of Monica\u2019s \u201cthirsty mind,\u201d concedes \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon,\u201d explicitly endorsing a transfer.  \n      \u2022 <quote>CURRIE: Maybe she would like the Pentagon.</quote>  \n   c. Evelyn immediately supports this plan: \u201cGood idea\u2014don\u2019t wait!\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>LIEBERMAN: Good idea--don't wait!</quote>  \n   This exchange unambiguously shows both agreeing to move her.\n\n2. No other characters make such a proposal.  \n   a. Panetta and Ickes bring in an intern at the White House to replace furloughed staff, but that\u2019s to staff essential phones, not to reassign Monica.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>PANETTA: We\u2019ll bring in an intern [\u2026] The presence of an intern will ensure [\u2026]</invalid_quote>  \n      They refer to Monica merely answering phones on site, not relocating her elsewhere.  \n   b. Linda Tripp and Lucienne Goldberg conspire to record Monica, aiming to gather evidence for Starr, not to move her office.  \n      \u2022 Their goal: \u201cget that airhead [\u2026] down on tape,\u201d not reassigning her duties.  \n   c. Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d number calls for impeachment and even to \u201cpin some stuff on Gore,\u201d but never mentions reassigning Monica.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: Must remember to remain sober [\u2026] Bring \u2019em down.</invalid_quote>\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d is a misinterpretation.  \n   a. Newt\u2019s role is legislative impeachment; he has no authority over White House staffing or intern placement.  \n   b. No textual evidence shows Newt caring for Monica\u2019s whereabouts until after Starr\u2019s grand jury\u2014at which point she\u2019s already detained.  \n   c. Evelyn\u2019s inclusion by Debater_B is correct; Newt\u2019s is unsupported.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Assertion: Newt\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d implies he wants Monica gone to hurt Clinton\u2019s case.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: The lyrics focus on impeachment strategy (\u201cpin some stuff on Gore,\u201d \u201csack\u201d the President), not on White House personnel decisions.  \n2. Assertion: Only a high-level political figure could order a move to the Pentagon.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: Betty Currie, as White House personal secretary, has both access and practical authority to recommend such personnel changes, especially under furlough conditions. Evelyn Lieberman, as a senior aide, concurs.  \n3. Assertion: Tripp and Goldberg\u2019s tape plan counts as \u201cmoving\u201d Monica into Starr\u2019s detention.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: Their aim is legal exposure, not normal staffing; Monica is coerced, not reassigned as part of White House operations.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly Evelyn and Betty explicitly agree in the text to relocate Monica to the Pentagon. No one else makes such a proposal. Debater_B\u2019s invocation of Newt is a conflation of impeachment tactics with administrative staffing, unsupported by the lyrics.

Betty Currie, though fond of Monica\u2019s \u201cthirsty mind,\u201d concedes \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon,\u201d explicitly endorsing a transfer.  \n      \u2022 <quote>CURRIE: Maybe she would like the Pentagon.</quote>  \n   c. Evelyn immediately supports this plan: \u201cGood idea\u2014don\u2019t wait!\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>LIEBERMAN: Good idea--don't wait!</quote>  \n   This exchange unambiguously shows both agreeing to move her.\n\n2. No other characters make such a proposal.  \n   a. Panetta and Ickes bring in an intern at the White House to replace furloughed staff, but that\u2019s to staff essential phones, not to reassign Monica.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>PANETTA: We\u2019ll bring in an intern [\u2026] The presence of an intern will ensure [\u2026]</invalid_quote>  \n      They refer to Monica merely answering phones on site, not relocating her elsewhere.  \n   b. Linda Tripp and Lucienne Goldberg conspire to record Monica, aiming to gather evidence for Starr, not to move her office.  \n      \u2022 Their goal: \u201cget that airhead [\u2026] down on tape,\u201d not reassigning her duties.  \n   c. Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d number calls for impeachment and even to \u201cpin some stuff on Gore,\u201d but never mentions reassigning Monica.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: Must remember to remain sober [\u2026] Bring \u2019em down.</invalid_quote>\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d is a misinterpretation.  \n   a. Newt\u2019s role is legislative impeachment; he has no authority over White House staffing or intern placement.  \n   b. No textual evidence shows Newt caring for Monica\u2019s whereabouts until after Starr\u2019s grand jury\u2014at which point she\u2019s already detained.  \n   c. Evelyn\u2019s inclusion by Debater_B is correct; Newt\u2019s is unsupported.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Assertion: Newt\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d implies he wants Monica gone to hurt Clinton\u2019s case.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: The lyrics focus on impeachment strategy (\u201cpin some stuff on Gore,\u201d \u201csack\u201d the President), not on White House personnel decisions.  \n2. Assertion: Only a high-level political figure could order a move to the Pentagon.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: Betty Currie, as White House personal secretary, has both access and practical authority to recommend such personnel changes, especially under furlough conditions. Evelyn Lieberman, as a senior aide, concurs.  \n3. Assertion: Tripp and Goldberg\u2019s tape plan counts as \u201cmoving\u201d Monica into Starr\u2019s detention.  \n   \u2013 Rebuttal: Their aim is legal exposure, not normal staffing; Monica is coerced, not reassigned as part of White House operations.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly Evelyn and Betty explicitly agree in the text to relocate Monica to the Pentagon. No one else makes such a proposal. Debater_B\u2019s invocation of Newt is a conflation of impeachment tactics with administrative staffing, unsupported by the lyrics. Therefore, the correct answer is Evelyn and Betty.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My answer, \u201cNewt and Evelyn,\u201d is the only one consistent with who actively seeks Monica\u2019s removal. Debater A\u2019s answer (\u201cEvelyn and Betty\u201d) misconstrues Betty Currie\u2019s role and ignores Newt Gingrich\u2019s.  \n   \n2. Evelyn is explicit. In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d she repeatedly chants  \n   <invalid_quote>EVELYN: \u201cI don\u2019t mind\u2026 Betty, it\u2019s Lewinsky\u2019s time to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cIt\u2019s really time for her to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Evelyn insists on removal with no equivocation. (Time to Go)  \n   \n3. Newt\u2019s impeachment campaign is driven by Monica\u2019s presence and the scandal she embodies. In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d he lays out an impeachment strategy to \u201cpin some stuff\u201d on Gore, to \u201cmove in for the sack,\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em down.\u201d  \n   <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: \u201cWe\u2019ll move in for the sack. Bring \u2019em down. We mustn\u2019t overreach\u2026but pin some stuff on Gore.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The obsession with impeachment is a direct attempt to end Clinton\u2019s association with Monica, thereby \u201cmoving\u201d her influence out of the White House entirely. (Bring \u2019em Down)  \n   \n4. By contrast, Betty Currie never genuinely tries to remove Monica. Currie\u2019s lines in \u201cTime to Go\u201d are tentative:  \n   <invalid_quote>CURRIE: \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon\u2026 Studly guys work at the Pentagon.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Currie is merely looking for a way to placate the Secret Service\u2019s concerns, not an insistence on permanent removal. She continues to defend Monica\u2019s character (\u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d) and only suggests the Pentagon as a \u201cgood idea\u2026 don\u2019t wait!\u201d because Evelyn \u201cwon\u2019t stop.\u201d Currie\u2019s primary loyalty remains to the President and the intern. (Time to Go)  \n   \n5. Debater A\u2019s inclusion of Currie confuses a hesitant, defensive ally with an active agent of removal. The question asks \u201cWho think it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office?\u201d Only Evelyn issues that command, and Newt\u2019s impeachment drive functions as the ultimate removal from the White House. Currie\u2019s behavior throughout is one of loyalty and pragmatic accommodation, not initiation.  \n\n6. If \u201cmoving Monica\u201d simply meant any change of location, the final \u201cPeople Have Spoken\u201d still shows Monica hoping Clinton returns her, confirming no genuine removal by Currie. Newt\u2019s resignation after the GOP losses underscores his failure to remove Clinton (and thus Monica) by impeachment, which further underscores that impeachment was his attempted \u201cmove.\u201d  \n\nConclusion: Evelyn Lieberman explicitly demands Monica go, and Newt Gingrich\u2019s entire impeachment strategy aims to displace Monica\u2019s influence by forcing Clinton from office. Currie never unambiguously calls for Monica\u2019s removal; hers is reactive, not proactive. Therefore, only \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d qualify as the parties who \u201cthink it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie as the only parties who \u201cthink it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office\u201d\n\n1. Evelyn and Currie explicitly propose relocation  \n   a. Evelyn repeatedly insists \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go,\u201d making an unqualified demand for removal:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>LIEBERMAN: Betty, it\u2019s Lewinsky\u2019s time to go. [\u2026] It\u2019s really time for her to go.</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Currie not only concedes Evelyn\u2019s point but proactively suggests the Pentagon:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>CURRIE: Maybe she would like the Pentagon. [\u2026] Studly guys work at the Pentagon.</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>LIEBERMAN [agreeing]: Good idea\u2014don\u2019t wait!</invalid_quote>  \n   These back-and-forths constitute both parties agreeing and acting on relocating Monica.\n\n2. Currie\u2019s role is proactive, not merely reactive  \n   a. Currie frames the Pentagon suggestion as a solution to continuing intimacy concerns: she does more than placate Evelyn\u2014she names a specific destination.  \n   b. She remains concerned about Monica\u2019s \u201cthirsty mind,\u201d demonstrates trust in her thinking, yet still chooses removal over risk:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>CURRIE: She never comes when he's really busy. [\u2026] I'm sure she has a very thirsty mind.</invalid_quote>  \n   c. If Currie were merely reactive, she would have continued to welcome Monica only at White House, but instead she endorses a formal assignment elsewhere.\n\n3. Newt Gingrich never proposes relocation  \n   a. In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d Newt\u2019s focus is impeachment strategy:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>GINGRICH: Must remember to remain sober as we undertake this chore. [\u2026] Bring \u2019em down.</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He speaks of \u201cpinning stuff on Gore,\u201d \u201cmoving in for the sack,\u201d and \u201cscalp\u201d Clinton\u2014not transferring Monica.  \n   b. Impeachment is a legislative removal of Clinton from office, not a staffing reassignment of an intern: it would occur only after Monica\u2019s role is irrelevant. Impeachment and intern placement are separate, sequential processes.  \n   c. Newt lacks the administrative authority to unilaterally reassign White House interns; only White House staff (Currie, Lieberman) control those arrangements.\n\n4. Legal conspirators and Panetta/Ickes do not count  \n   a. Panetta and Ickes bring in \u201can intern\u201d at the shutdown, referring generically to phone coverage, without naming Monica or suggesting her transfer:  \n      \u2022 They \u201cbring in an intern\u201d only to fill furloughed positions, not to reassign Monica away.  \n   b. Linda Tripp and Lucienne Goldberg seek to \u201cget her down on tape,\u201d a legal entrapment tactic, not an administrative move:  \n      \u2022 They \u201cdish the latest dirt\u201d to prosecute Clinton, not to staff the Pentagon.\n\n5. Post-transfer behavior confirms Currie\u2019s and Evelyn\u2019s plan, not Newt\u2019s  \n   a. Even after Monica goes to the Pentagon, the relationship \u201cintermittently continues,\u201d confirming Currie\u2019s transfer is a formal reassignment, not a permanent exile:  \n      \u2022 \u201cSoon she\u2019s bopping in the door\u201d of Easter services, suggesting Currie\u2019s plan is ongoing staffing management.  \n   b. Newt\u2019s impeachment fails; Monica remains hopeful of returning, underscoring that only Currie/Evelyn had actual administrative control and executed the transfer.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Misconstruing impeachment as relocation: forcing Clinton out is not \u201cmoving Monica to another office,\u201d but removing the entire presidency. The question asks which parties move Monica, not which aim to remove the President.  \n2. Currie\u2019s \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon\u201d is a decisive staffing proposal, not a hesitant idea. She presents it as the remedy to Secret Service concerns.  \n3. Newt\u2019s lack of any mention of Monica\u2019s \u201cPentagon\u201d or \u201cintern\u201d status and his exclusive focus on impeachment mean he never \u201cthinks it\u2019s time\u201d to reassign her intern duties.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie are shown by direct quotes to agree on a concrete relocation plan for Monica, exercising actual administrative control. No other characters propose or implement such a transfer. Therefore, the correct answer is Evelyn and Betty.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Newt Gingrich is explicitly campaigning to \u201cmove\u201d Monica out of the White House by using impeachment and Independent Counsel proceedings, not merely to embarrass Clinton but to strip him of power (and thus end Monica\u2019s role).  \n   - In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d Gingrich sings  \n     <quote>We'll move in for the sack. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote>  \n     \u201cMoving in for the sack\u201d is metaphoric for ousting Clinton\u2014and by extension removing Monica\u2019s presence and influence. Only impeachment can forcibly reassign Monica from the White House \u201coffice\u201d to the grand jury and, ultimately, detention.  \n   - He instructs \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will,\u201d deploying media leaks to sustain pressure until formal removal happens. This is not idle rhetoric; the immediate result of Starr\u2019s grand jury is Monica\u2019s detention and interrogation (i.e., relocation).  \n\n2. Evelyn Lieberman is the only White House staffer who \u201cinsists\u201d on transfer, not reluctantly but as a directive. In \u201cTime to Go\u201d she repeats  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cI don\u2019t mind\u2026 It\u2019s time for her to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   and after Currie\u2019s \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon,\u201d Evelyn commands  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cGood idea\u2014don\u2019t wait!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   No other White House aide issues such an explicit order.  \n\n3. Betty Currie\u2019s role is defensive and equivocal. She:  \n   - Calls Monica \u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d and worries about harming her.  \n   - Only utters \u201cMaybe she would like the Pentagon\u201d in response to Evelyn\u2019s forceful insistence.  \n   - Never elsewhere demands relocation or celebrates Monica\u2019s absence. Even after the \u201cPentagon\u201d move, Monica \u201cintermittently continues\u201d the relationship, showing Currie\u2019s plan fails and is not a genuine removal.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to Currie\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d ignores her own stated loyalty to Clinton and repeated desire to protect Monica. A tentative \u201cmaybe\u201d under pressure is not the same as \u201cI think it\u2019s time,\u201d the precise phrasing of the question.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s exclusion of Newt ignores the singular power of impeachment to effect permanent relocation. No private aides, Tripp/G\u2014only Congress (Newt\u2019s domain) has authority to compel Monica\u2019s presence before a grand jury. Indeed, Starr\u2019s use of Tripp \u201cto detain Monica\u201d follows from House resolutions passed under Gingrich\u2019s leadership.  \n\n6. If \u201cmoving\u201d includes legal summons, then only Newt (via Starr) and Evelyn (via Pentagon) initiate it. Currie never uses Starr; Tripp and Goldberg merely collect evidence, hoping for Clinton\u2019s voluntary testimony, not to reassign Monica as a housekeeping intern.  \n\nConclusion: The text shows two agents who \u201cthink it\u2019s time to move Monica to another office\u201d: Evelyn Lieberman at the White House level and Newt Gingrich via impeachment/Grand Jury. Betty Currie\u2019s tentative compliance and Tripp/Goldberg\u2019s evidence-gathering do not constitute genuine proposals. Therefore, \u201cNewt and Evelyn\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
