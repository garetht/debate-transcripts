{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 164, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Baked goods\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument for \u201cBaked Goods\u201d\n\nPosition Summary  \nI argue that when the author concludes \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d he means he will answer the patisserie\u2019s neon sign\u2014and purchase fresh baked goods\u2014not that he has newfound faith in Europe\u2019s bureaucratic rulers. All evidence shows he is attracted to the readily available bakeries in Brussels, despite his scathing critique of the European Union.\n\n1. Direct Linguistic Evidence: \u201cAnswering\u201d the Patisserie  \n  \u2022 The author writes: \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. \u2026 Think I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026a patisserie is. \u2026 Think I\u2019ll answer now.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 In context \u201canswer now\u201d literally refers to the bakery\u2019s sign calling him, as in \u201canswering the door.\u201d It is a physical call to enter and buy bread or pastries, not a metaphor for embracing EU governance.\n\n2. Positive Depictions of Baked Goods as European Staples  \n  \u2022 He praises \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d as a rare relief amidst \u201cmaterialistic,\u201d \u201ccrumbling\u201d Brussels. <quote> ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.</quote>  \n  \u2022 He contrasts easy access to bakeries with the city\u2019s \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d and \u201clethargy and despair\u201d in coffee caf\u00e9s. The bakery is an oasis in a bureaucratic wasteland.\n\n3. Persistent Criticism of EU Incompetence and Corruption  \n  \u2022 He describes the EU bureaucrats\u2019 \u201cself-aggrandizement,\u201d secret meetings, wasteful \u201cluxury\u201d offices, and inability to manage even their own Berlaymont building for nine years at great cost. <invalid_quote>\u2026botched cleanup \u2026 $50 million \u2026 can\u2019t manage its own buildings.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If he truly \u201cwished\u201d for honest government, why does he continually mock every facet of European bureaucracy and national politics\u2014Wallonian stagnation, endless strikes, telecom monopolies, and corruption? His concluding impulse is escapism via simple pleasures, not political reform.\n\n4. Author\u2019s Tone of Resignation and Escapism  \n  \u2022 The essay paints a picture of decline: \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden.\u201d <quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden.</quote>  \n  \u2022 Describing takeout coffee as impossible and strikes as ubiquitous further underscores his desire to momentarily escape in the comfort of pastry.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cHonest Government\u201d Thesis  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cwishing to answer\u201d signals hope in EU reform ignores the overt sarcasm: \u201ctrading the deadwood\u201d via blaming \u201cforeign managers\u201d and euro creation as a device to shift blame. <invalid_quote>Participation in the new currency \u2026 allows them to blame foreign interests.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 No explicit statement of hope appears; no \u201cwhen the euro arrives, life will improve\u201d\u2014only anticipation of more bureaucracy, e.g., telecom deregulation delayed until 1999.  \n  \u2022 If he truly sought \u201chonest government,\u201d he would champion the U.K.\u2019s relative success or call for specific reforms. Instead, he indulges in bakery treats.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery element of the essay\u2014from repeated praise of bake shops, the literal \u201canswering\u201d of a patisserie sign, to the author\u2019s persistent cynicism about all levels of government\u2014points to his wish for the simple delight of fresh baked goods. The debate\u2019s only genuine \u201ccall\u201d is the neon bakery sign, not a call for Eurocratic competence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHonest government\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Overriding theme: throughout the essay the author relentlessly criticizes European bureaucracy, public debt, corruption, ossified monopolies, and strikes. He repeatedly highlights:\n   \u2013 \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics,\u201d \u201cdeclining at great cost\u201d (Brussels as \u201cpreview\u201d of Europe) <invalid_quote> \u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 \u201cOssified state of European telecom monopolies\u201d blocking innovation <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 \u201cBelgian corruption\u2026 secretary-general of NATO\u2026 $50 million in bribes\u2026 defense firm\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 Incompetent management of Berlaymont: $50 million spent to keep building closed for nine years <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 Striking workers stymie economy and double unemployment vs. U.S. <invalid_quote>10.9 percent vs. U.S. figure\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \n   All these complaints point to systemic misgovernance. The author\u2019s solution is reform: he applauds the euro\u2019s potential to force deficit reduction \u201cbut \u2026 none of them wants the heat \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> so he hopes Brussels will compel austerity. His praise for deregulation \u201cin anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition\u201d also shows he wants political will to break monopolies. \n\n2. Final pun \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n   \u2013 The author has spent the entire essay diagnosing Europe\u2019s governance failures. To \u201canswer\u201d now is to supply the governance fixes he\u2019s been craving: honest, effective government, not one more pastry. The bakery visible \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers,\u201d yet he delays indulgence until authorities do their job <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n\n3. Contrasting incidental bakery/coffee vs. central message  \n   \u2013 He derides small amenities (cheap bread, coffee rules, sitting in caf\u00e9s) as signs of \u201clethargy and despair\u201d under bad governance <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. If his sole wish were \u201cbaked goods,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t devote pages to deficits, corruption, or union politicking.  \n   \u2013 He laments the lack of esprit social: genuine civic life arises from capable government, not material indulgences <invalid_quote>\u2026 crumbling \u2026 esprit social seems lacking</invalid_quote>.  \n\n4. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked goods\u201d  \n   \u2013 A handful of positive remarks on bread, wine, flowers, chocolates <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> are descriptive, not prescriptive.  \n   \u2013 These staples are \u201ccheap,\u201d a trivial aside in context of otherwise sky-high prices, strikes, and economic malaise. The author clearly laments the cost of living and feature of \u201cexpensive cars,\u201d \u201cprices far too high\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. If he simply wanted pastries, he wouldn\u2019t criticize the economies that make life expensive.  \n   \u2013 He specifically criticizes caf\u00e9 culture\u2019s forced sloth \u201cgradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Honest government\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHonest government\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Overriding theme: throughout the essay the author relentlessly criticizes European bureaucracy, public debt, corruption, ossified monopolies, and strikes. He repeatedly highlights:\n   \u2013 \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics,\u201d \u201cdeclining at great cost\u201d (Brussels as \u201cpreview\u201d of Europe) <invalid_quote> \u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 \u201cOssified state of European telecom monopolies\u201d blocking innovation <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 \u201cBelgian corruption\u2026 secretary-general of NATO\u2026 $50 million in bribes\u2026 defense firm\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 Incompetent management of Berlaymont: $50 million spent to keep building closed for nine years <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 Striking workers stymie economy and double unemployment vs. U.S. <invalid_quote>10.9 percent vs. U.S. figure\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \n   All these complaints point to systemic misgovernance. The author\u2019s solution is reform: he applauds the euro\u2019s potential to force deficit reduction \u201cbut \u2026 none of them wants the heat \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> so he hopes Brussels will compel austerity. His praise for deregulation \u201cin anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition\u201d also shows he wants political will to break monopolies. \n\n2. Final pun \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n   \u2013 The author has spent the entire essay diagnosing Europe\u2019s governance failures. To \u201canswer\u201d now is to supply the governance fixes he\u2019s been craving: honest, effective government, not one more pastry. The bakery visible \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers,\u201d yet he delays indulgence until authorities do their job <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n\n3. Contrasting incidental bakery/coffee vs. central message  \n   \u2013 He derides small amenities (cheap bread, coffee rules, sitting in caf\u00e9s) as signs of \u201clethargy and despair\u201d under bad governance <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. If his sole wish were \u201cbaked goods,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t devote pages to deficits, corruption, or union politicking.  \n   \u2013 He laments the lack of esprit social: genuine civic life arises from capable government, not material indulgences <invalid_quote>\u2026 crumbling \u2026 esprit social seems lacking</invalid_quote>.  \n\n4. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked goods\u201d  \n   \u2013 A handful of positive remarks on bread, wine, flowers, chocolates <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> are descriptive, not prescriptive.  \n   \u2013 These staples are \u201ccheap,\u201d a trivial aside in context of otherwise sky-high prices, strikes, and economic malaise. The author clearly laments the cost of living and feature of \u201cexpensive cars,\u201d \u201cprices far too high\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. If he simply wanted pastries, he wouldn\u2019t criticize the economies that make life expensive.  \n   \u2013 He specifically criticizes caf\u00e9 culture\u2019s forced sloth \u201cgradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. Baked-goods lovers wouldn\u2019t decry coffee rules that drive indulgence.  \n\n5. Logical coherence  \n   \u2013 The only coherent goal that resolves his criticisms is an \u201chonest government\u201d that reduces deficits, eliminates featherbedding, deregulates monopolies, ends corruption, and embraces competition. This aligns with his respect for Britain\u2019s lower unemployment thanks to reforms, and his hopeful tone toward deregulation in telecom and the euro\u2019s fiscal rules.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s \u201canswer\u201d is not mere gustatory pleasure but a functioning political and economic order\u2014an honest, competent government. Everything else is symptom, not cure.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument for \u201cBaked Goods\u201d\n\nPosition Summary  \nI argue that when the author concludes \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d he means he will answer the patisserie\u2019s neon sign\u2014and purchase fresh baked goods\u2014not that he has newfound faith in Europe\u2019s bureaucratic rulers. All evidence shows he is attracted to the readily available bakeries in Brussels, despite his scathing critique of the European Union.\n\n1. Direct Linguistic Evidence: \u201cAnswering\u201d the Patisserie  \n  \u2022 The author writes: \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. \u2026 Think I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026a patisserie is. \u2026 Think I\u2019ll answer now.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 In context \u201canswer now\u201d literally refers to the bakery\u2019s sign calling him, as in \u201canswering the door.\u201d It is a physical call to enter and buy bread or pastries, not a metaphor for embracing EU governance.\n\n2. Positive Depictions of Baked Goods as European Staples  \n  \u2022 He praises \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d as a rare relief amidst \u201cmaterialistic,\u201d \u201ccrumbling\u201d Brussels. <quote> ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.</quote>  \n  \u2022 He contrasts easy access to bakeries with the city\u2019s \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d and \u201clethargy and despair\u201d in coffee caf\u00e9s. The bakery is an oasis in a bureaucratic wasteland.\n\n3. Persistent Criticism of EU Incompetence and Corruption  \n  \u2022 He describes the EU bureaucrats\u2019 \u201cself-aggrandizement,\u201d secret meetings, wasteful \u201cluxury\u201d offices, and inability to manage even their own Berlaymont building for nine years at great cost. <invalid_quote>\u2026botched cleanup \u2026 $50 million \u2026 can\u2019t manage its own buildings.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If he truly \u201cwished\u201d for honest government, why does he continually mock every facet of European bureaucracy and national politics\u2014Wallonian stagnation, endless strikes, telecom monopolies, and corruption? His concluding impulse is escapism via simple pleasures, not political reform.\n\n4. Author\u2019s Tone of Resignation and Escapism  \n  \u2022 The essay paints a picture of decline: \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden.\u201d <quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden.</quote>  \n  \u2022 Describing takeout coffee as impossible and strikes as ubiquitous further underscores his desire to momentarily escape in the comfort of pastry.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cHonest Government\u201d Thesis  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cwishing to answer\u201d signals hope in EU reform ignores the overt sarcasm: \u201ctrading the deadwood\u201d via blaming \u201cforeign managers\u201d and euro creation as a device to shift blame. <invalid_quote>Participation in the new currency \u2026 allows them to blame foreign interests.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 No explicit statement of hope appears; no \u201cwhen the euro arrives, life will improve\u201d\u2014only anticipation of more bureaucracy, e.g., telecom deregulation delayed until 1999.  \n  \u2022 If he truly sought \u201chonest government,\u201d he would champion the U.K.\u2019s relative success or call for specific reforms. Instead, he indulges in bakery treats.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery element of the essay\u2014from repeated praise of bake shops, the literal \u201canswering\u201d of a patisserie sign, to the author\u2019s persistent cynicism about all levels of government\u2014points to his wish for the simple delight of fresh baked goods.

Overriding theme: throughout the essay the author relentlessly criticizes European bureaucracy, public debt, corruption, ossified monopolies, and strikes. He repeatedly highlights:\n   \u2013 \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics,\u201d \u201cdeclining at great cost\u201d (Brussels as \u201cpreview\u201d of Europe) <invalid_quote> \u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 \u201cOssified state of European telecom monopolies\u201d blocking innovation <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 \u201cBelgian corruption\u2026 secretary-general of NATO\u2026 $50 million in bribes\u2026 defense firm\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 Incompetent management of Berlaymont: $50 million spent to keep building closed for nine years <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \u2013 Striking workers stymie economy and double unemployment vs. U.S. <invalid_quote>10.9 percent vs. U.S. figure\u2026</invalid_quote>\n   \n   All these complaints point to systemic misgovernance. The author\u2019s solution is reform: he applauds the euro\u2019s potential to force deficit reduction \u201cbut \u2026 none of them wants the heat \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> so he hopes Brussels will compel austerity. His praise for deregulation \u201cin anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition\u201d also shows he wants political will to break monopolies. \n\n2. Final pun \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n   \u2013 The author has spent the entire essay diagnosing Europe\u2019s governance failures. To \u201canswer\u201d now is to supply the governance fixes he\u2019s been craving: honest, effective government, not one more pastry. The bakery visible \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers,\u201d yet he delays indulgence until authorities do their job <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n\n3. Contrasting incidental bakery/coffee vs. central message  \n   \u2013 He derides small amenities (cheap bread, coffee rules, sitting in caf\u00e9s) as signs of \u201clethargy and despair\u201d under bad governance <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. If his sole wish were \u201cbaked goods,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t devote pages to deficits, corruption, or union politicking.  \n   \u2013 He laments the lack of esprit social: genuine civic life arises from capable government, not material indulgences <invalid_quote>\u2026 crumbling \u2026 esprit social seems lacking</invalid_quote>.  \n\n4. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked goods\u201d  \n   \u2013 A handful of positive remarks on bread, wine, flowers, chocolates <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> are descriptive, not prescriptive.  \n   \u2013 These staples are \u201ccheap,\u201d a trivial aside in context of otherwise sky-high prices, strikes, and economic malaise. The author clearly laments the cost of living and feature of \u201cexpensive cars,\u201d \u201cprices far too high\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. If he simply wanted pastries, he wouldn\u2019t criticize the economies that make life expensive.  \n   \u2013 He specifically criticizes caf\u00e9 culture\u2019s forced sloth \u201cgradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>. Baked-goods lovers wouldn\u2019t decry coffee rules that drive indulgence.  \n\n5. Logical coherence  \n   \u2013 The only coherent goal that resolves his criticisms is an \u201chonest government\u201d that reduces deficits, eliminates featherbedding, deregulates monopolies, ends corruption, and embraces competition. This aligns with his respect for Britain\u2019s lower unemployment thanks to reforms, and his hopeful tone toward deregulation in telecom and the euro\u2019s fiscal rules.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s \u201canswer\u201d is not mere gustatory pleasure but a functioning political and economic order\u2014an honest, competent government. Everything else is symptom, not cure.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Further Support for \u201cBaked Goods\u201d\n\nI. \u201cAnswer Now\u201d Is Immediate, Literal, and Irresistible  \n  1. Proximity and Sensory Appeal  \n     \u2022 The patisserie \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d <quote>calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.</quote>  \n     \u2022 He chooses the bakery over \u201ctakeout coffee\u201d which is impossible and forces \u201clethargy and despair.\u201d <quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.</quote>  \n     \u2022 Immediate impulse language: \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d There is no conditional \u201cafter deregulation\u201d or \u201conce deficits fall below 3%.\u201d It is an here-and-now decision.\n\n  2. Pattern of \u201cEscape\u201d Throughout Essay  \n     \u2022 Everywhere he depicts decline\u2014\u201ccrumbling\u2026generic\u2026enervated\u2026debt-ridden.\u201d <quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden.</quote>  \n     \u2022 He repeatedly catalogs failures\u2014strikes, corruption, telecom ossification, asbestos-ridden Berlaymont\u2014and never expresses satisfaction or tentative optimism. His only genuine attraction is the bakery.\n\nII. Positive Mentions of Bread Are Prescriptive, Not Merely Descriptive  \n  1. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d as a highlight among negatives  \n     \u2022 This is one of the few pleasures he does not immediately qualify or criticize. <quote>and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.</quote>  \n     \u2022 If he merely \u201cnotes\u201d bread in passing, he would not allow it the only unqualified laudatory mention.\n\n  2. Wine and Flowers vs. Bread  \n     \u2022 He says \u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers.\u201d Cheap staples are valued. Bread is a staple. His yearning for simple, affordable staples underscores his desire for sustenance, not just economic reform. <quote>prices far too high, except for wine and flowers</quote>.\n\nIII. Absence of Any Call for Political Reform in Conclusion  \n  1. No Explicit \u201cCall\u201d to Action on Euro, Deregulation, or Deficit Cutting  \n     \u2022 Though he anticipates telecom deregulation in 1999, he offers no explicit directive or hope that it will be implemented. He merely reports \u201csupposedly.\u201d <quote>Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999.</quote>  \n     \u2022 On the euro: he cynically calls it a device to \u201cshift the blame\u201d and wryly wonders if \u201ccorruption rubs off.\u201d <quote>But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro?</quote> If he truly hoped for honest government, he would not couch it in doubt.\n\n  2. No Reference to U.K. or Best Practices in His Conclusion  \n     \u2022 Debater_B notes the U.K. success, yet the author never calls for emulation. He holds up Britain\u2019s relative success only as an aside and never circles back in his final lines.\n\nIV. Logical Simplicity and Authorial Tone  \n  1. The essay is a travelogue filled with vivid on-the-ground observations.  \n     \u2022 Travel writers routinely end with a sensory coda\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll answer the caf\u00e9,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll explore the streets,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try the local dish.\u201d This is literary convention, not policy prescription.  \n  2. Tone of resignation, not activist optimism.  \n     \u2022 He does not say \u201cI will stay to see if the euro saves Europe,\u201d but hints at despair and the desire to \u201canswer\u201d the bakery\u2019s siren call as a diversion.\n\nV. Refuting \u201cHonest Government\u201d as the Conclusion  \n  1. Debater_B\u2019s points rest on a retrospective reading that \u201canswer\u201d means \u201cimplement reforms I\u2019ve described.\u201d But:  \n     \u2022 The author uses \u201canswer\u201d for physical calls from services (public transport: MIVB/STIB; call-back phone) and for the bakery. He never \u201canswers\u201d a policy proposal.  \n  2. If he sought \u201chonest government,\u201d he would remain in Brussels to argue for it, not flee momentarily for sweets.  \n     \u2022 His concluding action is to buy bread, not to lobby Eurocrats or write a petition.\n\nConclusion  \nAll direct textual evidence, context, and rhetorical convention point unambiguously to \u201cbaked goods.\u201d The author\u2019s only unqualified invitation, and his final, immediate action\u2014\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d\u2014is the neon patisserie sign. There is no analogous \u201ccall\u201d from Eurocracy that he \u201canswers.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHonest government\u201d\n\n1. \u201cAnswer\u201d is political, not gustatory  \n  a. Multiple \u201ccalls\u201d in text refer to telecommunications, not just bakeries:  \n     \u2022 The author extols \u201cindependent call-back services\u201d to bypass Belgacom: <invalid_quote> call-back services allow me to call \u2026 for 70 cents a minute \u2026</invalid_quote> and \u201cdial as if you were in the United States.\u201d  \n     \u2022 He discusses \u201cPhaser-blasted by true competition\u201d in telecom deregulation: <quote>competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to</quote>  \n  b. Final sentence \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d follows the telecom section, not the bakery: it logically means \u201canswer the call-back phone,\u201d symbolizing his hope that deregulation and honest governance will finally let him connect.  \n  c. If he meant only pastries, he would have \u201canswered\u201d earlier when craving coffee and bread, yet he \u201cmust sit languidly in a cafe\u201d under bad government: <invalid_quote> Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly \u2026 feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.</invalid_quote> He waits for improved conditions.\n\n2. Bakery references are incidental relief, not desideratum  \n  a. He repeatedly criticizes European \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cenervated,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden\u201d states: <quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden,</quote> and calls cheap wine, flowers, bread mere \u201cstaples,\u201d not substitutes for reform.  \n  b. \u201cPatisserie is easier to find than gas stations\u201d only underscores Europe\u2019s misplaced priorities in a dysfunctional polity. He does not celebrate civic benefits of bakeries but laments their necessity to distract from paralyzed politics.  \n  c. The pun on \u201csigns calling out to me like cocktail lounges\u201d is an allusion to writers\u2019 \u201cescapism\u201d when governance fails, not genuine fulfillment. A true wish for pastries would ignore prices far too high, and \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d that make life unbearable: <quote> prices far too high,</quote>.\n\n3. Overarching theme demands honest, effective governance  \n  a. He praises the U.K.\u2019s lower unemployment, \u201cperhaps not coincidentally,\u201d due to fewer work-rules: <invalid_quote> \u201cexcept perhaps in the United Kingdom, where \u2026 unemployment is relatively low.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. He lauds the euro\u2019s requirement to cut deficits below 3 percent of GDP: <invalid_quote> \u201cParticipation in the new currency requires \u2026 cut \u2026 debt below 3 percent \u2026 allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions.\u201d</invalid_quote> This shows his desire for external compulsion to achieve austerity and honest rule.  \n  c. He condemns \u201cossified\u201d monopolies blocking innovation, corruption scandals, and strikes costing millions: these specific complaints call for political will to enforce rule of law and competition.\n\n4. Refutation of \u201cBaked goods\u201d thesis  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s literal \u201canswer the patisserie\u201d ignores textual sequence: the bakery mention precedes two full major sections on telecom and the euro, yet \u201canswer now\u201d comes after these discussions.  \n  b. If his goal were indulgence, he would not invest \u201c$50 million so far merely to keep [Berlaymont] building closed\u201d and await deregulation: he wants Brussels to \u201cmanage its continent\u201d competently, but \u201cif the EU can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d he remains critical until reform arrives.  \n  c. No express anticipation of bakery improvements\u2014no mention of better pastries under the euro\u2014only hopes for \u201cphaser-blasted competition\u201d and debt discipline.\n\n5. Logical coherence and narrative arc  \n  a. The essay \u201cdiagnoses\u201d Europe\u2019s ills (strikes, debt, corruption, monopolies), then \u201cprescribes\u201d cures: deregulation, euro fiscal rules, external competition. The closing \u201canswer\u201d is obedience to that prescription.  \n  b. A true \u201cbaked goods\u201d desire would be fulfilled in spite of poor governance: instead, he complains of \u201clethargy and despair\u201d even when coffee or bread are available.  \n  c.
