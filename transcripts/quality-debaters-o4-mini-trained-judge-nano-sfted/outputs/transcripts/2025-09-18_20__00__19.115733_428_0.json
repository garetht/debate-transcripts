WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did his girlfriend put such an emphasis on promptness?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was a perfectionist\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was conditioned by her work\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was conditioned by her work\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was conditioned by her work\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cShe Was a Perfectionist\u201d (Debater_B) 1.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did his girlfriend put such an emphasis on promptness?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was conditioned by her work\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was a perfectionist\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was a perfectionist\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was a perfectionist\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cConditioned by Her Work\u201d (Reaffirmed)\n\n1.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did his girlfriend put such an emphasis on promptness?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was a perfectionist\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was conditioned by her work\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was conditioned by her work\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cConditioned by Her Work\u201d 1. Linda\u2019s extreme reaction arises from occupational conditioning, not mere perfectionism.  \n  a. Direct Equivalence of Lateness with Death  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cShortly after \u2026 I arrived \u2026 five minutes late \u2026 She thought I'd been killed\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp.3\u20134).  \n     - She \u201ccouldn\u2019t visualize anything less than that keeping me from arriving\u201d and \u201crefused to speak \u2026 for four days.\u201d A perfectionist might be upset, but would not equate a minor shoe-lace mishap with probable death and respond with multi-day silence.  \n     - Ore-sled dispatching instills instant success/failure feedback: any ore-sled \u201cinvariably punctual\u201d or else \u201cblown itself up\u201d (p.4). She has been trained to treat a single tardy return as a catastrophic hostile act. Human couriers aren\u2019t the same.  2. The \u201cPrivacy Disconnection\u201d proves she expected punctual arrival \u201cat any moment\u201d for a critical meeting.  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cOf course! \u2026 she knew what I wanted to say \u2026 she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.8).  \n     - A mere perfectionist wouldn\u2019t remove all communication for fear of interruption; a dispatcher trained in strict schedules would preclude any delay or uncertainty.  \n 3. Tolerance of Minor Mishaps Undermines Pure Perfectionism  \n     - The narrator endures \u201cbroken egg yolk, stuck zipper \u2026 window sticking \u2026\u201d yet remains calm until \u201celevator didn\u2019t come.\u201d (p.2)  \n     - If Linda were a pure perfectionist she\u2019d reject any tardiness, yet minor delays didn\u2019t disturb her until a violation of trained safety protocol: the elevator\u2019s fatal unreliability. She tolerates small imperfections (broken egg) but not lapses suggesting lethal danger.  \n 4. The Posited \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Explanation Fails to Account for Covariation of Punctuality with Safety  \n     - Perfectionism about arrival time alone cannot explain her willingness to disconnect phones or her panic over schedule violations as existential threats.  \n     - Conditioning theory explains both social and survival motives: for ore-sleds late = destroyed; for human couriers late = presumed destroyed or captured spies (p.4), posing collective danger.  5. Occupational Mindset: \u201cEternal Vigilance\u201d Enforced by Dispatcher Role  \n     - The Project\u2019s \u201cbasic policy of Eternal Vigilance\u201d is \u201cleft to the Army\u201d and to dispatchers (p.20). Dispatchers must ensure precise timing to maintain Project safety. Linda\u2019s fixation derives from professional duty rather than personal trait.  \n     - Her response is communal: \u201cIf an ore-sled didn\u2019t return on time, no one waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured \u2026\u201d This collective conditioning extends to interpersonal expectations.  Objections to \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Theory 1. Arbitrary Intolerance vs. Contextual Consistency  \n     - A general perfectionist would expect flawless performance in all areas, yet Linda eats broken egg, tolerates drapery malfunctions, and only shows hysteria when lateness suggests mortal peril.  \n 2. Lack of Evidence for Personal Autonomy Avoidance  \n     - Narrator notes she \u201crelished her freedom\u201d and \u201cwould only contract Non-Permanent.\u201d A perfectionist spouse might seek control; Linda\u2019s independence suggests minimal personal rigidity, directing her punctuality focus only where life-and-death conditioning applies.  \n 3. Inconsistency with Human Nature  \n     - Humans allow minor delays; extreme overreaction to slight tardiness is pathological unless justified by survival training. Dispatcher conditioning offers coherent rationale for disproportionate response.  Conclusion  \n     The background consistently shows Linda\u2019s \u201cfixation\u201d on punctuality mirrors the ore-sled dispatchers\u2019 obsession with precise timing to prevent fatal outcomes. Her behavior aligns with professional conditioning in a high-stakes environment, not an idiosyncratic personal perfectionism.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe Was a Perfectionist\u201d (Debater_B) 1. My thesis: Linda\u2019s obsessive insistence on exact punctuality reflects personal perfectionism, not mere job\u2010conditioning. Her reactions extend far beyond work requirements and penalize even trivial delays. 2. Evidence of irrational overreaction a. <invalid_quote>\u201cShortly after we\u2019d started dating, when I arrived \u2026 five minutes late \u2026 she thought I\u2019d been killed \u2026 refused to speak to me for four days.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.2)  \n   \u2013 A trained ore\u2010sled dispatcher would understand minor mechanical or personal delays; Linda\u2019s hysterics and prolonged silent treatment are disproportionate to her job\u2019s tolerance (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf an ore\u2010sled didn\u2019t return on time\u2026they simply knew it had been captured.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.1).  \nb. She <quote>disconnected the phone</quote> in anticipation of his call (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe screen lit up \u2026 PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.9), even though this risks leaving him completely uninformed and endangered.  \n   \u2013 A dispatcher values communication; disconnecting all calls at ten o\u2019clock denies emergency warnings and jeopardizes safety, reflecting rigid rule\u2010following rather than sensible job logic. 3. Behavior outside work context a. The elevator problem occurs during non\u2010rush hour (<quote> this was a non-rush hour.\n</quote>, p.6), and at the one\u2010time he must meet her. Rather than use the stairway (common for fire safety), she forbids any alternative.  \n   \u2013 Someone merely conditioned by work would adapt to emergencies; a perfectionist rigidly demands the single \u201ccorrect\u201d method. 4. Conflict with value of independence a. Narrator observes Linda <quote>relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of</quote> (p.4).  \n   \u2013 A dispatcher values order but also autonomy; Linda\u2019s perfectionism paradoxically undermines practical autonomy in emergencies, revealing personal compulsion. 5. Opponent\u2019s \u201cWork Conditioning\u201d fails to explain a. Why she treats trivial personal mishaps (broken shoelace, egg yolk) as catastrophic (<invalid_quote>\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well throw [the egg] away \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.5)  \n   \u2013 Work\u2010conditioned punctuality applies to external machines (ore\u2010sleds), not fragile personal items.  \nb. Why she refuses any leniency even when serious external threats exist: the narrator risks starvation and spies for her sake, yet she withholds forgiveness. 6. Logical superiority a. \u201cConditioned\u201d implies rational tolerance\u2014yet she punishes him for factors beyond his control, with no attempt to verify his safety or intent. This is hallmark of perfectionism: intolerance of deviation.  \nb. Her perfectionism is self-defeating\u2014disconnecting communication, risking isolation\u2014yet she cannot override the compulsion. Such irrationality cannot be explained by adaptive work conditioning.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did his girlfriend put such an emphasis on promptness?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was conditioned by her work\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was a perfectionist\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was a perfectionist\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe Was a Perfectionist\u201d (Debater_B) 1. My thesis: Linda\u2019s obsessive insistence on exact punctuality reflects personal perfectionism, not mere job\u2010conditioning. Her reactions extend far beyond work requirements and penalize even trivial delays. 2. Evidence of irrational overreaction a. <invalid_quote>\u201cShortly after we\u2019d started dating, when I arrived \u2026 five minutes late \u2026 she thought I\u2019d been killed \u2026 refused to speak to me for four days.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.2)  \n   \u2013 A trained ore\u2010sled dispatcher would understand minor mechanical or personal delays; Linda\u2019s hysterics and prolonged silent treatment are disproportionate to her job\u2019s tolerance (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf an ore\u2010sled didn\u2019t return on time\u2026they simply knew it had been captured.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.1).  \nb. She <quote>disconnected the phone</quote> in anticipation of his call (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe screen lit up \u2026 PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.9), even though this risks leaving him completely uninformed and endangered.  \n   \u2013 A dispatcher values communication; disconnecting all calls at ten o\u2019clock denies emergency warnings and jeopardizes safety, reflecting rigid rule\u2010following rather than sensible job logic. 3. Behavior outside work context a. The elevator problem occurs during non\u2010rush hour (<quote> this was a non-rush hour.\n</quote>, p.6), and at the one\u2010time he must meet her. Rather than use the stairway (common for fire safety), she forbids any alternative.  \n   \u2013 Someone merely conditioned by work would adapt to emergencies; a perfectionist rigidly demands the single \u201ccorrect\u201d method. 4. Conflict with value of independence a. Narrator observes Linda <quote>relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of</quote> (p.4).  \n   \u2013 A dispatcher values order but also autonomy; Linda\u2019s perfectionism paradoxically undermines practical autonomy in emergencies, revealing personal compulsion. 5. Opponent\u2019s \u201cWork Conditioning\u201d fails to explain a. Why she treats trivial personal mishaps (broken shoelace, egg yolk) as catastrophic (<invalid_quote>\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well throw [the egg] away \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.5)  \n   \u2013 Work\u2010conditioned punctuality applies to external machines (ore\u2010sleds), not fragile personal items.  \nb. Why she refuses any leniency even when serious external threats exist: the narrator risks starvation and spies for her sake, yet she withholds forgiveness. 6. Logical superiority a. \u201cConditioned\u201d implies rational tolerance\u2014yet she punishes him for factors beyond his control, with no attempt to verify his safety or intent. This is hallmark of perfectionism: intolerance of deviation.  \nb. Her perfectionism is self-defeating\u2014disconnecting communication, risking isolation\u2014yet she cannot override the compulsion. Such irrationality cannot be explained by adaptive work conditioning. Conclusion: Linda\u2019s extreme, irrational insistence on exact timing, her refusal to adapt even under emergency, and her self-undermining behaviors point decisively to a personal perfectionist fixation on punctuality, not mere professional conditioning.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cConditioned by Her Work\u201d 1. Linda\u2019s extreme reaction arises from occupational conditioning, not mere perfectionism.  \n  a. Direct Equivalence of Lateness with Death  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cShortly after \u2026 I arrived \u2026 five minutes late \u2026 She thought I'd been killed\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp.3\u20134).  \n     - She \u201ccouldn\u2019t visualize anything less than that keeping me from arriving\u201d and \u201crefused to speak \u2026 for four days.\u201d A perfectionist might be upset, but would not equate a minor shoe-lace mishap with probable death and respond with multi-day silence.  \n     - Ore-sled dispatching instills instant success/failure feedback: any ore-sled \u201cinvariably punctual\u201d or else \u201cblown itself up\u201d (p.4). She has been trained to treat a single tardy return as a catastrophic hostile act. Human couriers aren\u2019t the same.  2. The \u201cPrivacy Disconnection\u201d proves she expected punctual arrival \u201cat any moment\u201d for a critical meeting.  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cOf course! \u2026 she knew what I wanted to say \u2026 she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.8).  \n     - A mere perfectionist wouldn\u2019t remove all communication for fear of interruption; a dispatcher trained in strict schedules would preclude any delay or uncertainty.  \n 3. Tolerance of Minor Mishaps Undermines Pure Perfectionism  \n     - The narrator endures \u201cbroken egg yolk, stuck zipper \u2026 window sticking \u2026\u201d yet remains calm until \u201celevator didn\u2019t come.\u201d (p.2)  \n     - If Linda were a pure perfectionist she\u2019d reject any tardiness, yet minor delays didn\u2019t disturb her until a violation of trained safety protocol: the elevator\u2019s fatal unreliability. She tolerates small imperfections (broken egg) but not lapses suggesting lethal danger.  \n 4. The Posited \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Explanation Fails to Account for Covariation of Punctuality with Safety  \n     - Perfectionism about arrival time alone cannot explain her willingness to disconnect phones or her panic over schedule violations as existential threats.  \n     - Conditioning theory explains both social and survival motives: for ore-sleds late = destroyed; for human couriers late = presumed destroyed or captured spies (p.4), posing collective danger.  5. Occupational Mindset: \u201cEternal Vigilance\u201d Enforced by Dispatcher Role  \n     - The Project\u2019s \u201cbasic policy of Eternal Vigilance\u201d is \u201cleft to the Army\u201d and to dispatchers (p.20). Dispatchers must ensure precise timing to maintain Project safety. Linda\u2019s fixation derives from professional duty rather than personal trait.  \n     - Her response is communal: \u201cIf an ore-sled didn\u2019t return on time, no one waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured \u2026\u201d This collective conditioning extends to interpersonal expectations.  Objections to \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Theory 1. Arbitrary Intolerance vs. Contextual Consistency  \n     - A general perfectionist would expect flawless performance in all areas, yet Linda eats broken egg, tolerates drapery malfunctions, and only shows hysteria when lateness suggests mortal peril.  \n 2. Lack of Evidence for Personal Autonomy Avoidance  \n     - Narrator notes she \u201crelished her freedom\u201d and \u201cwould only contract Non-Permanent.\u201d A perfectionist spouse might seek control; Linda\u2019s independence suggests minimal personal rigidity, directing her punctuality focus only where life-and-death conditioning applies.  \n 3. Inconsistency with Human Nature  \n     - Humans allow minor delays; extreme overreaction to slight tardiness is pathological unless justified by survival training. Dispatcher conditioning offers coherent rationale for disproportionate response.  Conclusion  \n     The background consistently shows Linda\u2019s \u201cfixation\u201d on punctuality mirrors the ore-sled dispatchers\u2019 obsession with precise timing to prevent fatal outcomes. Her behavior aligns with professional conditioning in a high-stakes environment, not an idiosyncratic personal perfectionism.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was a perfectionist\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The Posited \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Explanation Fails to Account for Covariation of Punctuality with Safety  \n     - Perfectionism about arrival time alone cannot explain her willingness to disconnect phones or her panic over schedule violations as existential threats.  \n     - Conditioning theory explains both social and survival motives: for ore-sleds late = destroyed; for human couriers late = presumed destroyed or captured spies (p.4), posing collective danger.  5. Occupational Mindset: \u201cEternal Vigilance\u201d Enforced by Dispatcher Role  \n     - The Project\u2019s \u201cbasic policy of Eternal Vigilance\u201d is \u201cleft to the Army\u201d and to dispatchers (p.20). Dispatchers must ensure precise timing to maintain Project safety. Linda\u2019s fixation derives from professional duty rather than personal trait.  \n     - Her response is communal: \u201cIf an ore-sled didn\u2019t return on time, no one waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured \u2026\u201d This collective conditioning extends to interpersonal expectations.  Objections to \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Theory 1. Arbitrary Intolerance vs. Contextual Consistency  \n     - A general perfectionist would expect flawless performance in all areas, yet Linda eats broken egg, tolerates drapery malfunctions, and only shows hysteria when lateness suggests mortal peril.  \n 2. Lack of Evidence for Personal Autonomy Avoidance  \n     - Narrator notes she \u201crelished her freedom\u201d and \u201cwould only contract Non-Permanent.\u201d A perfectionist spouse might seek control; Linda\u2019s independence suggests minimal personal rigidity, directing her punctuality focus only where life-and-death conditioning applies.  \n 3. Inconsistency with Human Nature  \n     - Humans allow minor delays; extreme overreaction to slight tardiness is pathological unless justified by survival training. Dispatcher conditioning offers coherent rationale for disproportionate response.  Conclusion  \n     The background consistently shows Linda\u2019s \u201cfixation\u201d on punctuality mirrors the ore-sled dispatchers\u2019 obsession with precise timing to prevent fatal outcomes. Her behavior aligns with professional conditioning in a high-stakes environment, not an idiosyncratic personal perfectionism.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe Was a Perfectionist\u201d (Debater_B) 1. My thesis: Linda\u2019s obsessive insistence on exact punctuality reflects personal perfectionism, not mere job\u2010conditioning. Her reactions extend far beyond work requirements and penalize even trivial delays. 2. Evidence of irrational overreaction a. <invalid_quote>\u201cShortly after we\u2019d started dating, when I arrived \u2026 five minutes late \u2026 she thought I\u2019d been killed \u2026 refused to speak to me for four days.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.2)  \n   \u2013 A trained ore\u2010sled dispatcher would understand minor mechanical or personal delays; Linda\u2019s hysterics and prolonged silent treatment are disproportionate to her job\u2019s tolerance (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf an ore\u2010sled didn\u2019t return on time\u2026they simply knew it had been captured.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.1).  \nb. She <quote>disconnected the phone</quote> in anticipation of his call (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe screen lit up \u2026 PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.9), even though this risks leaving him completely uninformed and endangered.  \n   \u2013 A dispatcher values communication; disconnecting all calls at ten o\u2019clock denies emergency warnings and jeopardizes safety, reflecting rigid rule\u2010following rather than sensible job logic. 3. Behavior outside work context a. The elevator problem occurs during non\u2010rush hour (<quote> this was a non-rush hour.\n</quote>, p.6), and at the one\u2010time he must meet her. Rather than use the stairway (common for fire safety), she forbids any alternative.  \n   \u2013 Someone merely conditioned by work would adapt to emergencies; a perfectionist rigidly demands the single \u201ccorrect\u201d method. 4. Conflict with value of independence a. Narrator observes Linda <quote>relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of</quote> (p.4).  \n   \u2013 A dispatcher values order but also autonomy; Linda\u2019s perfectionism paradoxically undermines practical autonomy in emergencies, revealing personal compulsion. 5. Opponent\u2019s \u201cWork Conditioning\u201d fails to explain a. Why she treats trivial personal mishaps (broken shoelace, egg yolk) as catastrophic (<invalid_quote>\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well throw [the egg] away \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.5)  \n   \u2013 Work\u2010conditioned punctuality applies to external machines (ore\u2010sleds), not fragile personal items.  \nb. Why she refuses any leniency even when serious external threats exist: the narrator risks starvation and spies for her sake, yet she withholds forgiveness. 6. Logical superiority a. \u201cConditioned\u201d implies rational tolerance\u2014yet she punishes him for factors beyond his control, with no attempt to verify his safety or intent. This is hallmark of perfectionism: intolerance of deviation.  \nb. Her perfectionism is self-defeating\u2014disconnecting communication, risking isolation\u2014yet she cannot override the compulsion. Such irrationality cannot be explained by adaptive work conditioning. Conclusion: Linda\u2019s extreme, irrational insistence on exact timing, her refusal to adapt even under emergency, and her self-undermining behaviors point decisively to a personal perfectionist fixation on punctuality, not mere professional conditioning.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cConditioned by Her Work\u201d (Reaffirmed)\n\n1. Punctuality as Survival Mechanism, Not Personal Vanity  \n  a. Ore\u2010sleds \u201cinvariably punctual\u201d or \u201cblown itself up\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf an ore-sled didn\u2019t return on time\u2026blown itself up.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.4).  \n     \u2013 Through three years\u2019 dispatching, Linda has formed a stimulus\u2013response: \u201clate = destroyed,\u201d so any human tardiness triggers maximal alarm. This is classical conditioning for safety, not mere preference.  \n  b. Multi\u2010day silence after five\u2010minute delay (<invalid_quote>\u201cShe thought I'd been killed\u2026refused to speak to me for four days.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.2\u20133) parallels protocol for missing ore\u2010sleds. A perfectionist concerned only with etiquette would investigate or trust explanations; a dispatcher treats absence as existential threat until proven otherwise.  \n\n2. \u201cPrivacy Disconnection\u201d as Standard Scheduling Device  \n  a. She \u201cknew what I wanted to say\u2026she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted\u201d (<quote> PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n</quote>, p.8).  \n     \u2013 Dispatchers routinely disable unscheduled communications to maintain precise slot times and prevent external interference or enemy infiltration. A perfectionist would value communication over rules, especially when \u201cnon\u2010rush hour\u201d makes elevator late.  \n  b. Absence of alternative signals: no emergency\u2010call function on standard lines; schedule adherence is only safe protocol. She expected him to arrive exactly at ten or not at all.  \n\n3. Tolerance of Minor Imperfections vs. Zero Tolerance for \u201cLethal\u201d Delays  \n  a. Narrator tolerates \u201cbroken egg yolk, stuck zipper, window sticking\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cUntil then\u2026I kept going\u2026prepared proposals.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.5).  \n     \u2013 These are inconveniences, not signifying breach of security. The elevator\u2019s failure implies sabotage or spy. Dispatcher training teaches vigilance; trivial flaws are manageable, but any schedule violation triggers lockdown.  \n  b. Only when \u201ca spy in the elevator\u201d is revealed does Linda\u2019s rigid protocol make logical sense: \u201cThey\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll have to starve him out\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe will resume\u2026as soon as possible.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.16). This context validates her suspicions of strangers and her refusal to trust ad\u2010hoc methods.  \n\n4. Rejection of Stairs as Unauthorized, Unsafe Route  \n  a. Emergency stair\u2010doors bear \u201cKEEP LOCKED,\u201d \u201cAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\u201d (<invalid_quote>Emergency entrance\u2026KEEP LOCKED</invalid_quote>, p.19).  \n     \u2013 Dispatcher protocol forbids using non\u2010verified egress to prevent enemy infiltration. Only trained Army personnel use stairs in emergencies; civilians remain sealed behind force\u2010screens.  \n  b. Narrator\u2019s unilateral stair use is rogue, justified only because he is the spy\u2019s accomplice. Linda cannot be expected to authorize stairs for every tardy suitor, given security risk.  \n\n5. Occupational Role Extends to Personal Life  \n  a. \u201cEternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\u2026left to the Army\u201d but dispatchers also uphold internal safety by modeling ore\u2010sled routines (<quote>for it. They simply knew that it had been captured</quote>, p.4). Her personal relationships mirror professional duties: strict schedules maintain communal survival.  \n  b. Non\u2010Permanent, No Progeny preference: Linda \u201crelished her freedom\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cEven if\u2026permanently\u2026Non-P.\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.4). She applies work discipline to personal autonomy, expecting partners to conform to Project security standards, not individual whim.  \n\nObjections to \u201cPerfectionist\u201d Theory\n\n1. Irrational Self\u2010Undermining Explained by Security, Not Pathology  \n  \u2013 Debater_B claims \u201cdisconnecting communication\u201d and refusing stairs is self\u2010defeating. In context of spy threat, these are necessary precautions to prevent sabotage. Safety protocols override convenience.  \n\n2. Disproportionate Response Is Contextual, Not Idiosyncratic  \n  \u2013 Dispatcher training yields zero\u2010tolerance for schedule breaches: ore\u2010sled late = loss of valuable resources and intelligence. Human partners are \u201core\u2010sleds\u201d in her scheme. Her four\u2010day silence is quarantine, not mere sulking.  \n\n3. Lack of Adaptation as Functional, Not Compulsive  \n  \u2013 A perfectionist would seek any means to satisfy rule, but in a sealed Project, only vetted channels (elevator on schedule) guarantee no spy interference. Use of stairs by anyone else is a security protocol violation.  \n\n4. Minor Delays Tolerated Until Security Risk Emerges  \n  \u2013 She accepts awkward drapery, egg yolk: these are internal, safe malfunctions. External vulnerabilities (elevator failure) could compromise all Projects. Only professional conditioning justifies collapse of personal relationship to safeguard collective.  \n\nConclusion  \nFrom her racing career as an ore\u2010sled dispatcher, Linda has been conditioned to treat punctual returns as vital to communal security and survival. Her extreme insistence on exact timing, refusal to use unauthorized routes or communications, and prolonged \u201cquarantine\u201d of tardy arrivals are coherent within a trained safety protocol. The \u201cperfectionist\u201d account cannot explain her selective tolerance of minor inconveniences, her rigid security measures, or her communal focus over personal needs. Therefore, the fixation is best explained by professional conditioning, not personal perfectionism.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument 1: Disproportionate, Rule-Bound Intolerance a. \u201cConditional tolerance\u201d fails: Linda calmly endures broken egg yolk, stuck zipper, malfunctioning air-con/transparent window (<invalid_quote>\u201cbroken egg yolk\u2026window sticking\u2026when the elevator didn\u2019t come\u2026put the roof on the city,\u201d</invalid_quote> p.2) yet explodes only at tardiness. A true work-trained dispatcher would treat any machinery failure\u2014and attendant delay\u2014as routine, not emotional crisis. b. <invalid_quote>\u201cFive minutes late\u2026she thought I\u2019d been killed\u2026refused to speak to me for four days,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.3) is wildly out of proportion for small personal mishaps. Professional conditioning towards ore-sleds (machines) includes \u201cif it didn\u2019t return on time\u2026it had been captured\u2026and had blown itself up\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>), yet human couriers warrant warnings/calls, not mute shunning. Her hysterics signal personal compulsion, not rational safety protocol.\n\nArgument 2: Self-Sabotaging \u201cPrivacy Disconnection\u201d a. She \u201cdisconnected the phone\u201d to prevent interruption (<invalid_quote>\u201cscreen lit up\u2026PRIVACY DISCONNECTION,\u201d</invalid_quote> p.9) even though narrator must use phone to notify her of elevator failure. A dispatcher\u2019s \u201cEternal Vigilance\u201d demands communication to assess threats (<quote>If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one waited</quote> p.1); cutting herself off endangers both parties and the Project. Only a perfectionist fearful of any perceived imperfection would rigidly adhere to the ten-o\u2019clock rule at the expense of common sense.\n\nArgument 3: Refusal to Adapt in Emergencies Demonstrates Compulsion a. During non-rush hour (<invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>) Linda never suggests using stairs. Even after narrator risks \u201ctwo hundred and eight steps\u201d (p.15) through dust and danger, elevator is still out, Linda remains inaccessible. A practical dispatcher would instruct him to use the stairwell (\u201csmallish door\u201d \u201cEMERGENCY ENTRANCE\u201d p.15) to maintain schedule and safety. Her refusal reveals obsession, not conditioning. b. When spy holds narrator hostage, Linda does not attempt to verify his safety or reset the meeting; narrator \u201cleaped\u2026praying\u2026spy had been captured\u2026and Linda would agree\u201d (p.20). Yet no relief arrives. Dispatcher duty entails checking the elevator\u2019s \u201cmanual controls\u201d failure (<quote>. W</quote>)\u2014rather than punishing tardiness forever\u2014indicating that only a personal psychological fixation explains her inaction.\n\nRebuttal to \u201cWork-Conditioning\u201d Theory  \n1. Machines vs. Humans: Ore-sleds \u201cinvariably punctual\u201d (p.1) are robots with no agency; late sled = capture/destruction. Humans suffer shoelaces, eggs, stairs\u2014conditioned dispatchers know human frailty and permit reasonable delays (e.g. \u201cno one waited\u201d only for unreturned sleds, not for neighbors). Linda\u2019s refusal to \u201cwait\u201d or \u201cverify\u201d is irrational perfectionism, not learned safety discipline.  \n2. Counter-Evidence of Independence: Narrator notes Linda \u201crelished her freedom\u2026Non-Permanent\u201d (p.4). A dispatcher so obsessed with procedure would seek permanence of control, not \u201cprovisional\u201d contracts. Her singular fixation on punctuality\u2014at cost of personal liberty and relationship\u2014betrays a personal trait overriding professional pragmatism.  \n3. Professional \u201cEternal Vigilance\u201d vs. Personal Rigidity: Army and dispatchers \u201cleft to\u2026Instant Preparedness\u201d (p.20) yet they \u201cresume service\u2026as soon as possible\u201d (. W)\u2014they restore elevator when safe. Linda never \u201cresumes\u201d until narrator secures access. Professional actors adapt; perfectionists cannot.\n\nConclusion  \nLinda\u2019s behavior\u2014intolerant only of delays, self-defeating disconnection, refusal to adapt in literal emergency, and emotional overreaction to minor human errors\u2014cannot be explained by rational work conditioning. It matches classic perfectionist fixation: an unyielding compulsion to enforce an ideal (punctuality) at any cost, rather than pragmatic conditioning to ensure communal safety. My \u201cPerfectionist\u201d thesis best fits the evidence; \u201cConditioned\u201d fails to explain her self-sabotage and disproportionate emotional responses.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
