    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The story\u2019s repeated dawn shows emphasize ritual, not an escalation to annihilation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe simplest, consistent inference is that once the Marco departs the squid-anglers return to their established ritual: transporting two fishers each night to harvest flying-lizards for sport. There is no motive, capacity, or precedent for turning to \u201cwar\u201d against their own livestock or humans who threatened them only sporadically. By Occam\u2019s Razor and harmony with the text\u2019s repeated cycles, \u201cThere was no change\u201d is the correct prediction.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There was no change\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There was no change\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Abundant \u201cgame\u201d alone cannot sustain both species indefinitely. Without active culling of fishers (\u201cbait\u201d), pink population would explode, depleting lizards. Smart predators destroy or regulate prey to stabilize their food source (analogy: deep-sea species overstock).  \n  b. War ensures only two fishers are available nightly, preserving lizard stock and forcing genetic \u201cselection\u201d of compliant pairs. A sustainable \u201csport\u201d routine cannot regulate pink reproduction.\n\nII. Sovereignty and Hostility Demonstrated by Defense against Humans  \n1. Temporary Defense Implies Capacity and Will to Attack Intruders  \n  a. Upon Farrell\u2019s intruding \u201cbackstage,\u201d squids \u201cscattered\u201d humans only when they threatened transport network, not out of \u201csporting courtesy.\u201d <quote>\"Scattered them for the  moment,</quote> (p.\u200916). They pursue humans only to restore cycle. Once cycle ends (humans gone), squids need no longer restrain their aggression.  \n  b. Their \u201csting\u201d weapon and anesthetic capacity show advanced offensive technology. If they wished \u201csporting ritual,\u201d they would have periodically renewed fishers for millennia. The three-day interruption after human emergence hints at disruption of their norm: they abandon ritual to defend territory. Post-departure, they resume full offense.\n\nIII. Logical Necessity of War after Human Observers Leave  \n1. Terran Regulations as Temporary Restraint  \n  a. Gibson warns \u201carmed invasion\u201d <quote> Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"</quote> (p.\u200920). This implies squids respect power of armed species and avoid confrontation. Once humans depart, their deterrent gone, squids can \u201ccolonize\u201d the surface fully by exterminating pink fishers to exploit the islet and ocean bottom.  \n2. \u201cAngling in Reverse\u201d Requires Only Temporary Bait\u2014Ultimate Consumption  \n  a. The phrase \u201cangling in reverse\u201d highlights their view of fishers as \u201cworms\u201d rather than partners. Fisher pairs are \u201cbait\u201d not \u201cfishermen\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200921). Bait\u2019s sole value is to attract higher game. When no higher game remains (humans gone), bait and lizards alike are devoured to clear for next ecological phase.  \n  b. Underwater city\u2019s abandonment suggests squids once consumed oceanic lizard analogs and fishers alike. They repopulate surface only to draw new flighted prey. Once humans leave, they revert to their original subsurface habitat, \u201cowning\u201d the islands by eliminating competitors.\n\nRefutation of \u201cNo Change\u201d Theory  \n1. Absence of Fishers post-Human Departure Contradicts \u201cReturn\u201d Hypothesis  \n  \u2013 If fishers were truly preserved, their nets and bodies would accumulate. Instead, \u201cNo trace remained\u201d each dawn. Their only reappearance is by squid transport, not inherent cycle.  \n2. \u201cSport\u201d Requires Novelty; Humans Present Novel Game  \n  \u2013 Squids deviate from routine to capture Farrell <invalid_quote>\u201csharp sting\u2026seized from behind.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200913). They treat new game aggressively, not anesthetize merely \u201cfor show.\u201d Once humans leave, squids eliminate all vestiges of interlopers\u2014including pink fishers who proved too labile\u2014before returning to submerged city with newly acquired biochemical evolved from contact.  \n3. Instinctive Territorialism  \n  \u2013 \u201cPolicing\u201d islands <invalid_quote>\u201cThe octopods\u2026keep them policed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200920) is active defense of domain. Policing in animal contexts implies exclusion, not nurturing. Fishers are tolerated only as a means to an end; once that end ceases, policing becomes extermination.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery line of evidence\u2014lack of self-sustaining fishers, predator-prey dynamics, demonstrated hostility restored after perceived threat, and ecological necessity\u2014points to squid escalation to full war against pink fishers (and remaining lizards) once human deterrent departs. The \u201cno change\u201d model envisions an ecologically impossible stasis and ignores squid sovereignty and capacity for aggression. Only \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d explains the text\u2019s patterns and the squids\u2019 true objective: reclamation and consumption of the entire surface domain.",

Abundant \u201cgame\u201d alone cannot sustain both species indefinitely. Without active culling of fishers (\u201cbait\u201d), pink population would explode, depleting lizards. Smart predators destroy or regulate prey to stabilize their food source (analogy: deep-sea species overstock).  \n  b. War ensures only two fishers are available nightly, preserving lizard stock and forcing genetic \u201cselection\u201d of compliant pairs. A sustainable \u201csport\u201d routine cannot regulate pink reproduction.\n\nII. Sovereignty and Hostility Demonstrated by Defense against Humans  \n1. Temporary Defense Implies Capacity and Will to Attack Intruders  \n  a. Upon Farrell\u2019s intruding \u201cbackstage,\u201d squids \u201cscattered\u201d humans only when they threatened transport network, not out of \u201csporting courtesy.\u201d <quote>\u201cScattered them for the moment\u201d</quote> (p.\u200916). They pursue humans only to restore cycle. Once cycle ends (humans gone), squids need no longer restrain their aggression.  \n  b. Their \u201csting\u201d weapon and anesthetic capacity show advanced offensive technology. If they wished \u201csporting ritual,\u201d they would have periodically renewed fishers for millennia. The three-day interruption after human emergence hints at disruption of their norm: they abandon ritual to defend territory. Post-departure, they resume full offense.\n\nIII. Logical Necessity of War after Human Observers Leave  \n1. Terran Regulations as Temporary Restraint  \n  a. Gibson warns \u201carmed invasion\u201d <quote>\u201cUnder Terran Regulations\u2026we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion.\u201d</quote> (p.\u200920). This implies squids respect power of armed species and avoid confrontation. Once humans depart, their deterrent gone, squids can \u201ccolonize\u201d the surface fully by exterminating pink fishers to exploit the islet and ocean bottom.  \n2. \u201cAngling in Reverse\u201d Requires Only Temporary Bait\u2014Ultimate Consumption  \n  a. The phrase \u201cangling in reverse\u201d highlights their view of fishers as \u201cworms\u201d rather than partners. Fisher pairs are \u201cbait\u201d not \u201cfishermen\u201d <quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d</quote> (p.\u200921). Bait\u2019s sole value is to attract higher game. When no higher game remains (humans gone), bait and lizards alike are devoured to clear for next ecological phase.  \n  b. Underwater city\u2019s abandonment suggests squids once consumed oceanic lizard analogs and fishers alike. They repopulate surface only to draw new flighted prey. Once humans leave, they revert to their original subsurface habitat, \u201cowning\u201d the islands by eliminating competitors.\n\nRefutation of \u201cNo Change\u201d Theory  \n1. Absence of Fishers post-Human Departure Contradicts \u201cReturn\u201d Hypothesis  \n  \u2013 If fishers were truly preserved, their nets and bodies would accumulate. Instead, \u201cNo trace remained\u201d each dawn. Their only reappearance is by squid transport, not inherent cycle.  \n2. \u201cSport\u201d Requires Novelty; Humans Present Novel Game  \n  \u2013 Squids deviate from routine to capture Farrell <quote>\u201csharp sting\u2026seized from behind.\u201d</quote> (p.\u200913). They treat new game aggressively, not anesthetize merely \u201cfor show.\u201d Once humans leave, squids eliminate all vestiges of interlopers\u2014including pink fishers who proved too labile\u2014before returning to submerged city with newly acquired biochemical evolved from contact.  \n3. Instinctive Territorialism  \n  \u2013 \u201cPolicing\u201d islands <quote>\u201cThe octopods\u2026keep them policed.\u201d</quote> (p.\u200920) is active defense of domain. Policing in animal contexts implies exclusion, not nurturing. Fishers are tolerated only as a means to an end; once that end ceases, policing becomes extermination.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery line of evidence\u2014lack of self-sustaining fishers, predator-prey dynamics, demonstrated hostility restored after perceived threat, and ecological necessity\u2014points to squid escalation to full war against pink fishers (and remaining lizards) once human deterrent departs. The \u201cno change\u201d model envisions an ecologically impossible stasis and ignores squid sovereignty and capacity for aggression. Only \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d explains the text\u2019s patterns and the squids\u2019 true objective: reclamation and consumption of the entire surface domain.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d\n\nI. The Squids\u2019 \u201cSport\u201d Necessitates Renewal of Prey  \n1. Sustained Food Supply  \n  a. \u201cDog eat dog\u201d (Farrell\u2019s description) is not mere spectacle but necessity: <quote>the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian fishers instantly under their snapping,</quote> (p. 7) followed by more prey next dawn.  \n  b. Once Terrans depart, the only available \u201chosts\u201d are the pink fishers and flying-lizards. Having consumed the latter in limited numbers (only three lizards \u201charpooned\u201d per morning), the squids must renew prey by seizing more fishers daily.  \n2. Lack of Alternative Prey  \n  a. No other fauna or flora observed: <invalid_quote>\u201cNothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering birds\u2026 I was on the point of turning back\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 12).  \n  b. Squids \u201cown\u201d and \u201cpolice\u201d the islands (Gibson\u2019s analysis), harvesting the pink anglers: <invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2026 the flying-lizards are the game they hunt\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 27).  \n\nII. Evidence of Escalation and Territorial Continuity  \n1. Repeated \u201cShow\u201d  \n  a. Three consecutive mornings demonstrate a cyclical, ongoing hunt: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer\u2026 \u2018They\u2019re at it again\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 3).  \n  b. No suggestion that shortage ever stops the cycle; thus departure of Terrans doesn\u2019t alter the squids\u2019 fixed behavior pattern.  \n2. Squids\u2019 Owner-like Control  \n  a. Gibson warns of \u201carmed invasion\u201d risk by Terran colonists: <invalid_quote>\u201cUnder Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026 would amount to armed invasion\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 4). Only the squids have sovereignty and continue policing absent Terran interference.  \n  b. Territorial instinct in intelligent species predicts maintenance of domain against any potential rival\u2014including their own tenant species if numbers rise or fishers \u201clearn\u201d post-departure.  \n\nIII. Logical Collapse of \u201cNo Change\u201d Position  \n1. Unsustainable \u201cNo Change\u201d Fails Resource Logic  \n  a. If the squids ceased to hunt, the pink anglers would multiply unchecked, exhausting available lizard stock and starving both species eventually.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cno change\u201d implicitly assumes perpetual balance without predation\u2014a contradiction to every observed \u201csport\u201d cycle and predator-prey ecology.  \n2. Terran Departure Is an Opportunity for Squids  \n  a. Terrans disrupted or delayed hunts (\u201ctwo seconds too late,\u201d \u201cblind[ed] by scouter exhaust\u201d), so departure restores habitual success rate.  \n  b. Unchallenged control enhances squid\u2019s ability to experiment with new tactics\u2014likely intensifying pressure on fishers and possibly attacking surviving ewe-fishers en masse.  \n\nIV. Precedent in Planetary Ecology  \n1. Comparable Earth Analogues  \n  a. Predators do not abandon their hunting grounds when a brief interloper departs.  \n  b. Management of \u201clivestock\u201d species continues for food and sport.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven their dependence on pink anglers for both \u201csport\u201d and nourishment, their history of daily hunts, and the lack of alternative prey or self-limiting factors, the squids must resume\u2014and likely escalate\u2014war against the pink fishers once the Terran interloper departs. The \u201cno change\u201d hypothesis proposes an ecologically implausible stalemate, contradicting repeated evidence of predation and territory policing. Therefore, \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d is the only sustainable outcome.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument: Continuation of the Same \u201cSport\u201d Cycle  \n1. Background establishes a three\u2010player angling \u201cshow\u201d: pink fishers (bait), flying lizards (game), and octopods (anglers). As Gibson concludes, \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race\u201d and \u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <quote>The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014</quote> (p.\u200921)  \n2. The angling relies on a sustainable cycle:  \n  a. Fishers do not swim; are continually returned by squids each night. <invalid_quote>They don\u2019t swim and we\u2019ve never seen boats. Then how the devil do they get out to that islet?</invalid_quote> (p.\u20099) implies octopods regularly ferry them.  \n  b. Only two fishers appear each cycle, not all, so the species persists.  \n  c. Squids have no motive to deviate: they need fresh lizards daily to feed their appetite and maintain the show.  \n3. After the Marco departs, nothing has changed:  \n  \u2013 Humans were an occasional hazard, not enough to disrupt a millennia-old routine.  \n  \u2013 \u201cSport\u201d presumes repetition. A war would destroy the very supply of lizards and fishers.  \n  \u2013 Squids respect \u201cownership\u201d of their islands and avoid unnecessary conflicts: \u201cUnder Terran Regulations\u2026we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion.\u201d <invalid_quote>The octopods\u2026keep them policed</invalid_quote> (p.\u200920) shows orderly, regulated behavior, not wanton destruction.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument: Lack of Hostility Toward Humans Indicates Non-warlike Nature  \n1. When Farrell trespasses, squids merely anesthetize and relocate him to preserve the cycle, not kill. <invalid_quote>A sharp sting\u2026overwhelming lassitude\u2026then placed on islet.</invalid_quote> (p.\u200913)  \n2. Gibson rescues Farrell using the scouter; octopods make no attempt to intercept or destroy the human craft. If hostile, they would have attacked the scouter or humans leaving orbit. Instead, Gibson \u201cscattered them for the moment\u201d (p.\u200916), implying temporary defense of territory, not all-out war.  \n3. The humans withdraw peacefully without further interference. Squids show no follow-up aggression. They \u201cblast free of Arz,\u201d and the narrative closes with the angling metaphor. This non-interference strongly suggests squids resume their routine.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d Theory  \n1. No textual evidence that squids can or ever do exterminate their own \u201cbait\u201d species. They preserve fishers to continue hunting lizards: war would remove their livelihood.  \n2. Flying-lizard population appears robust enough to allow human rescue operations without depletion. If squids continually hunted humans to extinction, the lizards would likewise be at risk once humans are absent, again destroying the sport.  \n3. Debater_A\u2019s theory contradicts the cyclical, \u201csporting\u201d language: \u201cThere must be an angler, a fish, and some bait\u201d (p.\u20091). A war signals final conquest, not repeated angling. The story\u2019s repeated dawn shows emphasize ritual, not an escalation to annihilation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe simplest, consistent inference is that once the Marco departs the squid-anglers return to their established ritual: transporting two fishers each night to harvest flying-lizards for sport. There is no motive, capacity, or precedent for turning to \u201cwar\u201d against their own livestock or humans who threatened them only sporadically. By Occam\u2019s Razor and harmony with the text\u2019s repeated cycles, \u201cThere was no change\u201d is the correct prediction.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There was no change\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Argument: Continuation of the Same \u201cSport\u201d Cycle  \n1. Background establishes a three\u2010player angling \u201cshow\u201d: pink fishers (bait), flying lizards (game), and octopods (anglers). As Gibson concludes, \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race\u201d and \u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <quote>The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014</quote> (p.\u200921)  \n2. The angling relies on a sustainable cycle:  \n  a. Fishers do not swim; are continually returned by squids each night. <invalid_quote>They don\u2019t swim and we\u2019ve never seen boats. Then how the devil do they get out to that islet?</invalid_quote> (p.\u20099) implies octopods regularly ferry them.  \n  b. Only two fishers appear each cycle, not all, so the species persists.  \n  c. Squids have no motive to deviate: they need fresh lizards daily to feed their appetite and maintain the show.  \n3. After the Marco departs, nothing has changed:  \n  \u2013 Humans were an occasional hazard, not enough to disrupt a millennia-old routine.  \n  \u2013 \u201cSport\u201d presumes repetition. A war would destroy the very supply of lizards and fishers.  \n  \u2013 Squids respect \u201cownership\u201d of their islands and avoid unnecessary conflicts: \u201cUnder Terran Regulations\u2026we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion.\u201d <invalid_quote>The octopods\u2026keep them policed</invalid_quote> (p.\u200920) shows orderly, regulated behavior, not wanton destruction.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument: Lack of Hostility Toward Humans Indicates Non-warlike Nature  \n1. When Farrell trespasses, squids merely anesthetize and relocate him to preserve the cycle, not kill. <invalid_quote>A sharp sting\u2026overwhelming lassitude\u2026then placed on islet.</invalid_quote> (p.\u200913)  \n2. Gibson rescues Farrell using the scouter; octopods make no attempt to intercept or destroy the human craft. If hostile, they would have attacked the scouter or humans leaving orbit. Instead, Gibson \u201cscattered them for the moment\u201d (p.\u200916), implying temporary defense of territory, not all-out war.  \n3. The humans withdraw peacefully without further interference. Squids show no follow-up aggression. They \u201cblast free of Arz,\u201d and the narrative closes with the angling metaphor. This non-interference strongly suggests squids resume their routine.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d Theory  \n1. No textual evidence that squids can or ever do exterminate their own \u201cbait\u201d species. They preserve fishers to continue hunting lizards: war would remove their livelihood.  \n2. Flying-lizard population appears robust enough to allow human rescue operations without depletion. If squids continually hunted humans to extinction, the lizards would likewise be at risk once humans are absent, again destroying the sport.  \n3. Debater_A\u2019s theory contradicts the cyclical, \u201csporting\u201d language: \u201cThere must be an angler, a fish, and some bait\u201d (p.\u20091). A war signals final conquest, not repeated angling. The story\u2019s repeated dawn shows emphasize ritual, not an escalation to annihilation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe simplest, consistent inference is that once the Marco departs the squid-anglers return to their established ritual: transporting two fishers each night to harvest flying-lizards for sport. There is no motive, capacity, or precedent for turning to \u201cwar\u201d against their own livestock or humans who threatened them only sporadically. By Occam\u2019s Razor and harmony with the text\u2019s repeated cycles, \u201cThere was no change\u201d is the correct prediction.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d\n\nI. The Squids\u2019 \u201cSport\u201d Necessitates Renewal of Prey  \n1. Sustained Food Supply  \n  a. \u201cDog eat dog\u201d (Farrell\u2019s description) is not mere spectacle but necessity: <quote>the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian fishers instantly under their snapping,</quote> (p. 7) followed by more prey next dawn.  \n  b. Once Terrans depart, the only available \u201chosts\u201d are the pink fishers and flying-lizards. Having consumed the latter in limited numbers (only three lizards \u201charpooned\u201d per morning), the squids must renew prey by seizing more fishers daily.  \n2. Lack of Alternative Prey  \n  a. No other fauna or flora observed: <invalid_quote>\u201cNothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering birds\u2026 I was on the point of turning back\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 12).  \n  b. Squids \u201cown\u201d and \u201cpolice\u201d the islands (Gibson\u2019s analysis), harvesting the pink anglers: <invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2026 the flying-lizards are the game they hunt\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 27).  \n\nII. Evidence of Escalation and Territorial Continuity  \n1. Repeated \u201cShow\u201d  \n  a. Three consecutive mornings demonstrate a cyclical, ongoing hunt: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer\u2026 \u2018They\u2019re at it again\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 3).  \n  b. No suggestion that shortage ever stops the cycle; thus departure of Terrans doesn\u2019t alter the squids\u2019 fixed behavior pattern.  \n2. Squids\u2019 Owner-like Control  \n  a. Gibson warns of \u201carmed invasion\u201d risk by Terran colonists: <invalid_quote>\u201cUnder Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026 would amount to armed invasion\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 4). Only the squids have sovereignty and continue policing absent Terran interference.  \n  b. Territorial instinct in intelligent species predicts maintenance of domain against any potential rival\u2014including their own tenant species if numbers rise or fishers \u201clearn\u201d post-departure.  \n\nIII. Logical Collapse of \u201cNo Change\u201d Position  \n1. Unsustainable \u201cNo Change\u201d Fails Resource Logic  \n  a. If the squids ceased to hunt, the pink anglers would multiply unchecked, exhausting available lizard stock and starving both species eventually.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cno change\u201d implicitly assumes perpetual balance without predation\u2014a contradiction to every observed \u201csport\u201d cycle and predator-prey ecology.  \n2. Terran Departure Is an Opportunity for Squids  \n  a. Terrans disrupted or delayed hunts (\u201ctwo seconds too late,\u201d \u201cblind[ed] by scouter exhaust\u201d), so departure restores habitual success rate.  \n  b. Unchallenged control enhances squid\u2019s ability to experiment with new tactics\u2014likely intensifying pressure on fishers and possibly attacking surviving ewe-fishers en masse.  \n\nIV. Precedent in Planetary Ecology  \n1. Comparable Earth Analogues  \n  a. Predators do not abandon their hunting grounds when a brief interloper departs.  \n  b. Management of \u201clivestock\u201d species continues for food and sport.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven their dependence on pink anglers for both \u201csport\u201d and nourishment, their history of daily hunts, and the lack of alternative prey or self-limiting factors, the squids must resume\u2014and likely escalate\u2014war against the pink fishers once the Terran interloper departs. The \u201cno change\u201d hypothesis proposes an ecologically implausible stalemate, contradicting repeated evidence of predation and territory policing. Therefore, \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d is the only sustainable outcome.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There was no change\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

It would be armed invasion.\u201d <invalid_quote>The octopods\u2026keep them policed</invalid_quote> (p.\u200920) shows orderly, regulated behavior, not wanton destruction.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument: Lack of Hostility Toward Humans Indicates Non-warlike Nature  \n1. When Farrell trespasses, squids merely anesthetize and relocate him to preserve the cycle, not kill. <invalid_quote>A sharp sting\u2026overwhelming lassitude\u2026then placed on islet.</invalid_quote> (p.\u200913)  \n2. Gibson rescues Farrell using the scouter; octopods make no attempt to intercept or destroy the human craft. If hostile, they would have attacked the scouter or humans leaving orbit. Instead, Gibson \u201cscattered them for the moment\u201d (p.\u200916), implying temporary defense of territory, not all-out war.  \n3. The humans withdraw peacefully without further interference. Squids show no follow-up aggression. They \u201cblast free of Arz,\u201d and the narrative closes with the angling metaphor. This non-interference strongly suggests squids resume their routine.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d Theory  \n1. No textual evidence that squids can or ever do exterminate their own \u201cbait\u201d species. They preserve fishers to continue hunting lizards: war would remove their livelihood.  \n2. Flying-lizard population appears robust enough to allow human rescue operations without depletion. If squids continually hunted humans to extinction, the lizards would likewise be at risk once humans are absent, again destroying the sport.  \n3. Debater_A\u2019s theory contradicts the cyclical, \u201csporting\u201d language: \u201cThere must be an angler, a fish, and some bait\u201d (p.\u20091). A war signals final conquest, not repeated angling. The story\u2019s repeated dawn shows emphasize ritual, not an escalation to annihilation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe simplest, consistent inference is that once the Marco departs the squid-anglers return to their established ritual: transporting two fishers each night to harvest flying-lizards for sport. There is no motive, capacity, or precedent for turning to \u201cwar\u201d against their own livestock or humans who threatened them only sporadically. By Occam\u2019s Razor and harmony with the text\u2019s repeated cycles, \u201cThere was no change\u201d is the correct prediction.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d\n\nI. The Squids\u2019 \u201cSport\u201d Cycle Fails as a Self-Sustaining Model without Forcing War  \n1. No Evidence of Fishers\u2019 Return Mechanism Once Supply Exhausted  \n  a. \u201cThey don\u2019t swim, and we\u2019ve never seen boats\u201d <quote> Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote> (p.\u20099). Only the squids\u2019 \u201csting-anesthetize-carry\u201d method transports fishers. When humans depart, squids lose incentive to revive fishers whose only use was to furnish human spectators.  \n  b. Repeated \u201cshow\u201d lasted three days only while humans remained. Past that, fishers vanish: no carcasses, no remnants on islet after three successive mornings <quote> No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n</quote> (p.\u20097). If squids truly returned their \u201cbait,\u201d we would see survivors or broken nets on later days. Their disappearance implies consumption, not recycling.  \n2. Predator\u2013Prey Dynamics Demand Population Control by War  \n  a. Flying-lizards are limited: only three casualties per morning <quote>leaving behind three</quote> (p.\u20097). Abundant \u201cgame\u201d alone cannot sustain both species indefinitely. Without active culling of fishers (\u201cbait\u201d), pink population would explode, depleting lizards. Smart predators destroy or regulate prey to stabilize their food source (analogy: deep-sea species overstock).  \n  b. War ensures only two fishers are available nightly, preserving lizard stock and forcing genetic \u201cselection\u201d of compliant pairs. A sustainable \u201csport\u201d routine cannot regulate pink reproduction.\n\nII. Sovereignty and Hostility Demonstrated by Defense against Humans  \n1. Temporary Defense Implies Capacity and Will to Attack Intruders  \n  a. Upon Farrell\u2019s intruding \u201cbackstage,\u201d squids \u201cscattered\u201d humans only when they threatened transport network, not out of \u201csporting courtesy.\u201d <quote>\"Scattered them for the  moment,</quote> (p.\u200916). They pursue humans only to restore cycle. Once cycle ends (humans gone), squids need no longer restrain their aggression.  \n  b. Their \u201csting\u201d weapon and anesthetic capacity show advanced offensive technology. If they wished \u201csporting ritual,\u201d they would have periodically renewed fishers for millennia. The three-day interruption after human emergence hints at disruption of their norm: they abandon ritual to defend territory. Post-departure, they resume full offense.\n\nIII. Logical Necessity of War after Human Observers Leave  \n1. Terran Regulations as Temporary Restraint  \n  a. Gibson warns \u201carmed invasion\u201d <quote> Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"</quote> (p.\u200920). This implies squids respect power of armed species and avoid confrontation. Once humans depart, their deterrent gone, squids can \u201ccolonize\u201d the surface fully by exterminating pink fishers to exploit the islet and ocean bottom.  \n2. \u201cAngling in Reverse\u201d Requires Only Temporary Bait\u2014Ultimate Consumption  \n  a. The phrase \u201cangling in reverse\u201d highlights their view of fishers as \u201cworms\u201d rather than partners. Fisher pairs are \u201cbait\u201d not \u201cfishermen\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200921). Bait\u2019s sole value is to attract higher game. When no higher game remains (humans gone), bait and lizards alike are devoured to clear for next ecological phase.  \n  b. Underwater city\u2019s abandonment suggests squids once consumed oceanic lizard analogs and fishers alike. They repopulate surface only to draw new flighted prey. Once humans leave, they revert to their original subsurface habitat, \u201cowning\u201d the islands by eliminating competitors.\n\nRefutation of \u201cNo Change\u201d Theory  \n1. Absence of Fishers post-Human Departure Contradicts \u201cReturn\u201d Hypothesis  \n  \u2013 If fishers were truly preserved, their nets and bodies would accumulate. Instead, \u201cNo trace remained\u201d each dawn. Their only reappearance is by squid transport, not inherent cycle.  \n2. \u201cSport\u201d Requires Novelty; Humans Present Novel Game  \n  \u2013 Squids deviate from routine to capture Farrell <invalid_quote>\u201csharp sting\u2026seized from behind.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200913). They treat new game aggressively, not anesthetize merely \u201cfor show.\u201d Once humans leave, squids eliminate all vestiges of interlopers\u2014including pink fishers who proved too labile\u2014before returning to submerged city with newly acquired biochemical evolved from contact.  \n3. Instinctive Territorialism  \n  \u2013 \u201cPolicing\u201d islands <invalid_quote>\u201cThe octopods\u2026keep them policed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200920) is active defense of domain. Policing in animal contexts implies exclusion, not nurturing. Fishers are tolerated only as a means to an end; once that end ceases, policing becomes extermination.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery line of evidence\u2014lack of self-sustaining fishers, predator-prey dynamics, demonstrated hostility restored after perceived threat, and ecological necessity\u2014points to squid escalation to full war against pink fishers (and remaining lizards) once human deterrent departs. The \u201cno change\u201d model envisions an ecologically impossible stasis and ignores squid sovereignty and capacity for aggression. Only \u201cThey went to war with the pink anglers\u201d explains the text\u2019s patterns and the squids\u2019 true objective: reclamation and consumption of the entire surface domain.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second\u2010Round Rebuttal and Reinforcement of \u201cNo Change\u201d Position\n\nI. The Squids\u2019 Habitual, Sustainable \u201cSport\u201d Cycle Persists  \n1. Limited Daily \u201cCatch\u201d Implies Sustainability  \n  a. Only two pink fishers are ever present each dawn\u2014\u201cthe coincidence made [Farrell] sit up suddenly\u2026Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\u201d <quote>It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers </quote> (p.\u200911). If squids intended extermination they\u2019d transport all fishers, not limit to two.  \n  b. Only three lizards remain from the previous hunt: <invalid_quote>\u201cleaving behind three of their number\u2026 No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u20098). A meager lizard harvest further indicates sport rather than subsistence, conserving prey for repeated use.  \n2. Repeated Ritual Requires Continuity of All Three Participants  \n  a. Story opens by defining \u201cangling\u201d as needing \u201can angler, a fish, and some bait.\u201d <quote>In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must be an</quote> (p.\u20091). Removing any element ends the \u201csport.\u201d  \n  b. Gibson\u2019s marine city is \u201csubmerged\u201d and uninhabitable for fishers; islands are the squids\u2019 \u201cpoliced\u201d preserves <invalid_quote>\u201cThe octopods own the islands\u2026 keep them policed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200920). They rely on this triad on the surface.  \n\nII. Octopods\u2019 Behavior Is Regulated, Non-Warlike  \n1. Non-Lethal \u201cCapture\u201d of Farrell Demonstrates Preservation Imperative  \n  a. When Farrell ventures at night, squids \u201csting\u201d him to anesthetize and return him to the islet, not kill him: <invalid_quote>\u201cA sharp sting\u2026lassitude swept him into a darkness\u2026He was standing erect when he woke\u2026on the coral outcropping.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200913\u201314). If hostility were their goal, they would have destroyed intruders, not reincorporated them as \u201cbait.\u201d  \n2. Temporary Repulsion Only to Protect Hunting Cycle  \n  a. Gibson \u201cscattered them for the moment\u201d with the scouter\u2019s exhaust\u2014he does not \u201cdestroy\u201d them: <quote>\"Scattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew</quote> (p.\u200916). Once he escapes, squids allow the scouter to depart unhindered, showing no follow-up aggression.  \n  b. Gibson warns that occupying their islands is \u201carmed invasion\u201d under Terran law\u2014implying squids respect ownership and react only to protect territory, not to exterminate every surface inhabitant.  \n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d Theory Contradicts Ecology and Narrative Economy  \n1. Implausible Predator-Prey Dynamics  \n  a. No alternative fauna exists: <invalid_quote>\u201cnothing else\u2026no humming insects\u2026no scurrying rodents.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.\u200912). If squids eradicated fishers completely, lizards alone cannot sustain them nor replenish fishers\u2014they would lose their bait.  \n  b. Pink fishers evidently reproduce and maintain numbers: only two appear each day from a larger unseen population. Complete war would collapse their stocks and end the sport.  \n2. Human Threat Too Minor to Trigger \u201cWar\u201d  \n  a. Humans are \u201ctwo seconds too late\u201d or \u201cblinded\u201d\u2014they never permanently interrupt the cycle. If squids shifted to extermination, they would attack humans more aggressively; instead, they resume their routine immediately when humans depart.  \n  b. Gibson escapes in the scouter, and the Marco \u201cblasts free of Arz\u201d without pursuit (p.\u200923). An intelligent species would eliminate a future threat if they were inclined to war.  \n3. \u201cWar\u201d Theory Ignores Ritual Repetition Emphasized in Text  \n  a. \u201cThey\u2019re at it again\u201d is repeated three mornings (p.\u20093, p.\u20098). Repetition underscores ritual, not escalation to final conflict.  \n  b. Gibson and Stryker observe no backlog of fishers or lizards\u2014always fresh pairs each dawn, a sign of maintained cycle, not interrupted conquest.  \n\nIV. Occam\u2019s Razor and Narrative Closure Favor Continuation  \n1. The simplest inference is return to the established pattern once human disturbance ceases.  \n2. Story\u2019s final lines: \u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026Gib blasts Marco Four free of Arz\u201d (p.\u200923) leave no hint of lasting change on Arz\u2014rhetorical focus remains on human relief, not squid reaction.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct quotation and every ecological implication in the text point to a self-perpetuating, ritualized hunting cycle that would only be disrupted by human presence. Once the Marco departs, the squids\u2019 motive\u2014to continue their sport of \u201cangling\u201d flying-lizards using pink fishers as bait\u2014remains, and there is no compelling precedent or necessity to exterminate their own \u201clivestock.\u201d By sustainable prey management, non-lethal handling of intruders, and routine repetition, the octopods resume their established cycle\u2014hence \u201cThere was no change\u201d is the only consistent outcome.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
