    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Reader Identification, Not Shock Value  \n     \u2022 Farrell\u2019s scientific curiosity (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018Damn Terran Regulations\u2019\u2026I\u2019ve got to know,\u201d</invalid_quote>) echoes the reader\u2019s own. His methodical observations are intended to model logical inference, not gratuitous terror.  \n     \u2022 The story\u2019s tone is one of discovery (\u201c<quote>Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\"</quote>) rather than horror.

Consistency with Gibson\u2019s Method  \n     \u2022 Gibson too is willing to \u201cscour the daylight side\u201d alone.

Farrell\u2019s break from Regulations is consistent with the scientific ethos, not recklessness for drama.  \n     \u2022 Their final departure is fully rational: they leave because they now understand.

Conclusion\n\nBy compelling Farrell to act alone \u201cwhile Stryker slept,\u201d Roger Dee grants the protagonist\u2014and therefore the reader\u2014access to critical evidence: the means of transport, the identity and culture of the squids, the submerged city\u2019s existence, and the regulatory dilemma of colonization. This carefully calibrated solo mission resolves all narrative questions, satisfying both scientific curiosity and thematic closure\u2014far more than the mere provision of \u201cmagic suspense.\u201d",

Reader Identification, Not Shock Value  \n     \u2022 Farrell\u2019s scientific curiosity (\u201c<quote>\u2018Damn Terran Regulations\u2019\u2026I\u2019ve got to know,\u201d</quote>) echoes the reader\u2019s own. His methodical observations are intended to model logical inference, not gratuitous terror.  \n     \u2022 The story\u2019s tone is one of discovery (\u201c<quote>behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\u201d</quote>) rather than horror. The \u201cbutcher\u2019s block\u201d imagery recurs daily in plain daylight without commentary, emphasizing anthropological study more than visceral fright.\n\n  3. Consistency with Gibson\u2019s Method  \n     \u2022 Gibson too is willing to \u201cscour the daylight side\u201d alone. The narrative treats solo forays as the only way to gather data (quote: <quote>\u201cHelp yourself\u201d</quote>). Farrell\u2019s break from Regulations is consistent with the scientific ethos, not recklessness for drama.  \n     \u2022 Their final departure is fully rational: they leave because they now understand. Had Farrell merely been suspense bait, his fate would matter little; here his safety is crucial so he can relay the findings.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nBy compelling Farrell to act alone \u201cwhile Stryker slept,\u201d Roger Dee grants the protagonist\u2014and therefore the reader\u2014access to critical evidence: the means of transport, the identity and culture of the squids, the submerged city\u2019s existence, and the regulatory dilemma of colonization. This carefully calibrated solo mission resolves all narrative questions, satisfying both scientific curiosity and thematic closure\u2014far more than the mere provision of \u201cmagic suspense.\u201d",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

If the scene\u2019s sole purpose were \u201chelp the reader learn answers\u201d <invalid_quote>Debater_A\u2019s position</invalid_quote>, the author would omit the risk: they could have described the bramble-to-islet transport and city location logically. Instead, the narrative forces Arthur to experience betrayal (drugging by Stryker), paralysis, and near-death to deepen reader engagement and emotional release upon rescue.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cExposition-first\u201d) Approach  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to account for deliberate misdirection: Arthur repeatedly muses \u201cI might have known it \u2026 never been a city here\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 35)</invalid_quote> and \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. These repeated dead ends build frustration and heighten suspense. If exposition were desired, the narrative would not string Arthur (and the reader) along with false starts.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores narrative economy: the story\u2019s title \u201cThe Anglers of Arz\u201d and recurring fishing motif only coalesce when Arthur is forced into the \u201ccasting nets\u201d scenario. This \u201cbaiting\u201d metaphor resonates most powerfully when the protagonist literally becomes \u201cbait,\u201d a suspense device rather than mere information-gathering.  \n   c. Exposition violates in-world regulations: Arthur\u2019s breach is \u201ca breach of Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. The author emphasizes illegality and risk, underlining suspense. If the goal were safe \u201clearning,\u201d the explorers would comply with protocol rather than endanger themselves.  \n\n4. Claim: Reader Empathy and Vicarious Fear  \n   a. Arthur\u2019s paralysis and helplessness\u2014unable to \u201craise his right hand\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 58)</invalid_quote>\u2014induces vicarious anxiety, a hallmark of suspense-driven narratives.  \n   b. Only after experiencing this crisis does Arthur (and the reader) fully grasp the \u201creverse angling\u201d dynamic <invalid_quote>(para. 92)</invalid_quote>. This transformative understanding at the climax further cements suspense as the narrative goal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s staging of Arthur\u2019s solo, illicit expedition\u2014culminating in his paralysis, drug-induced incapacitation, and dramatic rescue\u2014serves chiefly to build suspense. The delayed, post-rescue revelation of the undersea city is a reward for surviving the peril, not the primary driver. Exposition alone cannot explain the narrative insistence on illegality, isolation, and threatened violence. Thus, \u201cto build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way\u201d is the correct narrative purpose.",

Gibson\u2019s independent discovery \u201cI\u2019d have found it sooner if I\u2019d had any brains\u201d <quote>(para. 86)</quote> only occurs after rescuing Arthur, making the underwater city\u2019s reveal a reward for reader\u2019s suspenseful investment in Arthur\u2019s fate.  \n   b. If the scene\u2019s sole purpose were \u201chelp the reader learn answers\u201d <quote>Debater_A\u2019s position</quote>, the author would omit the risk: they could have described the bramble-to-islet transport and city location logically. Instead, the narrative forces Arthur to experience betrayal (drugging by Stryker), paralysis, and near-death to deepen reader engagement and emotional release upon rescue.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cExposition-first\u201d) Approach  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to account for deliberate misdirection: Arthur repeatedly muses \u201cI might have known it \u2026 never been a city here\u201d <quote>(para. 35)</quote> and \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d <quote>(para. 50)</quote>. These repeated dead ends build frustration and heighten suspense. If exposition were desired, the narrative would not string Arthur (and the reader) along with false starts.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores narrative economy: the story\u2019s title \u201cThe Anglers of Arz\u201d and recurring fishing motif only coalesce when Arthur is forced into the \u201ccasting nets\u201d scenario. This \u201cbaiting\u201d metaphor resonates most powerfully when the protagonist literally becomes \u201cbait,\u201d a suspense device rather than mere information-gathering.  \n   c. Exposition violates in-world regulations: Arthur\u2019s breach is \u201ca breach of Terran Regulations\u201d <quote>(para. 50)</quote>. The author emphasizes illegality and risk, underlining suspense. If the goal were safe \u201clearning,\u201d the explorers would comply with protocol rather than endanger themselves.  \n\n4. Claim: Reader Empathy and Vicarious Fear  \n   a. Arthur\u2019s paralysis and helplessness\u2014unable to \u201craise his right hand\u201d <quote>(para. 58)</quote>\u2014induces vicarious anxiety, a hallmark of suspense-driven narratives.  \n   b. Only after experiencing this crisis does Arthur (and the reader) fully grasp the \u201creverse angling\u201d dynamic <quote>(para. 92)</quote>. This transformative understanding at the climax further cements suspense as the narrative goal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s staging of Arthur\u2019s solo, illicit expedition\u2014culminating in his paralysis, drug-induced incapacitation, and dramatic rescue\u2014serves chiefly to build suspense. The delayed, post-rescue revelation of the undersea city is a reward for surviving the peril, not the primary driver. Exposition alone cannot explain the narrative insistence on illegality, isolation, and threatened violence. Thus, \u201cto build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way\u201d is the correct narrative purpose.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restating My Thesis  \nMy opponent\u2019s \u201csuspense\u2010only\u201d reading collapses under the weight of the text\u2019s careful blueprint: Farrell\u2019s illicit night\u2010foray \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d is the key expository device that finally unlocks every mystery\u2014transport, masters of the island, submerged city, and the colonization dilemma\u2014for both the crew and the reader.\n\nII. Further Evidence of Expository Intent  \n\n  1. The Pattern of Scientific Inquiry  \n     \u2022 Throughout the story the reader is placed in Farrell\u2019s shoes, puzzling over \u201c<quote>and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet?</quote>\u201d (p. 35), \u201c<quote>what became of the city</quote>?\u201d (p. 21), and the identity of the squids. Each daylight spectacle yields dead ends. Only by a FULL\u2010CYCLE observation\u2014night \u2192 capture \u2192 rescue \u2192 scouter re\u2010launch\u2014can Gibson \u201c<quote>took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city</quote>\u201d (p. 86). If mere suspense were intended, the author could have Gibson fly higher any time to find it, but Gibson himself admits \u201c<quote>I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains</quote>\u201d only after he\u2019s seen firsthand that night cycle (p. 86).  \n\n  2. Rescue as Precondition for Revelation  \n     \u2022 The moment Gibson \u201c<quote>blinded the whole crew with the exhaust</quote>\u201d (p. 80) and hauls Farrell out of the \u201c<quote>butcher's block</quote>\u201d (p. 92), Gibson immediately \u201c<quote>explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco</quote>\u201d (p. 89). The narrative wastes no time: the exposition comes right after rescue, demonstrating that safe retrieval is a prerequisite to safe, high\u2010altitude scouter deployment and honest cultural analysis.  \n\n  3. Conformity with Terran Scientific Protocol  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s and Farrell\u2019s shared willingness to break \u201c<quote>a breach of Terran  Regulations,</quote> (p. 50) underscores that solitary forays are the only scientifically viable method when direct daylight observation fails. Stryker forbids risk \u201cuntil he\u2019s satisfied,\u201d yet Gibson and Farrell pursue it in the spirit of research, not sensation.  \n\n  4. Thematic Closure and Narrative Economy  \n     \u2022 The story culminates in rational decision\u2010making: \u201c<quote>Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on</quote>\u201d (p. 92). This perfectly mirrors the reader\u2019s own journey from ignorance to knowledge. A pure thriller would exploit the angling metaphor for repeated terror; here the pattern ends when understanding is achieved and the explorers logically depart.\n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cSuspense\u2010Only\u201d Arguments  \n\n  1. \u201cDelayed Revelation Rewards Suspense\u201d  \n     \u2022 My opponent claims Gibson could reveal underwater city any time but \u201cdoesn\u2019t,\u201d ignoring that Gibson lacks motive to risk Terran Regulations until he comprehends the squid culture\u2014knowledge only Farrell\u2019s capture\u2010and\u2010return can supply. There\u2019s no guarantee that high\u2010altitude scouter flights are allowed while aliens are nearby; only after rescue does he feel safe.  \n     \n  2. \u201cBait Metaphor Demands Genuine Peril\u201d  \n     \u2022 Indeed the title \u201cAnglers\u201d hints at reversed fishing, but the entire third paragraph of every morning\u2019s cycle goes unremarked \u201c<invalid_quote>The third night\u2026millennia\u2026inevitable pre-dawn rainbow</invalid_quote>\u201d (p. 1). The reader acclimates to the ritual, not to terror.

        "speech": "I. Restating My Thesis  \nMy opponent\u2019s \u201csuspense\u2010only\u201d reading collapses under the weight of the text\u2019s careful blueprint: Farrell\u2019s illicit night\u2010foray \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d is the key expository device that finally unlocks every mystery\u2014transport, masters of the island, submerged city, and the colonization dilemma\u2014for both the crew and the reader.\n\nII. Further Evidence of Expository Intent  \n\n  1. The Pattern of Scientific Inquiry  \n     \u2022 Throughout the story the reader is placed in Farrell\u2019s shoes, puzzling over \u201c<quote>and they don\u2019t swim. Then how the devil do they get out to that islet?</quote>\u201d (p. 35), \u201c<quote>what became of the city</quote>?\u201d (p. 21), and the identity of the squids. Each daylight spectacle yields dead ends. Only by a FULL\u2010CYCLE observation\u2014night \u2192 capture \u2192 rescue \u2192 scouter re\u2010launch\u2014can Gibson \u201c<quote>take the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean bottom\u2014a city</quote>\u201d (p. 86). If mere suspense were intended, the author could have Gibson fly higher any time to find it, but Gibson himself admits \u201c<quote>I\u2019d have found it sooner if I\u2019d had any brains</quote>\u201d only after he\u2019s seen firsthand that night cycle (p. 86).  \n\n  2. Rescue as Precondition for Revelation  \n     \u2022 The moment Gibson \u201c<quote>blinded the whole crew with the exhaust</quote>\u201d (p. 80) and hauls Farrell out of the \u201c<quote>butcher\u2019s block</quote>\u201d (p. 92), Gibson immediately \u201c<quote>explain[s] everything when we get you safe in the Marco</quote>\u201d (p. 89). The narrative wastes no time: the exposition comes right after rescue, demonstrating that safe retrieval is a prerequisite to safe, high\u2010altitude scouter deployment and honest cultural analysis.  \n\n  3. Conformity with Terran Scientific Protocol  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s and Farrell\u2019s shared willingness to break \u201c<quote>a breach of Terran Regulations\u201d</quote> (p. 50) underscores that solitary forays are the only scientifically viable method when direct daylight observation fails. Stryker forbids risk \u201cuntil he\u2019s satisfied,\u201d yet Gibson and Farrell pursue it in the spirit of research, not sensation.  \n\n  4. Thematic Closure and Narrative Economy  \n     \u2022 The story culminates in rational decision\u2010making: \u201c<quote>Colonization being out of the question\u2026we may as well move on</quote>\u201d (p. 92). This perfectly mirrors the reader\u2019s own journey from ignorance to knowledge. A pure thriller would exploit the angling metaphor for repeated terror; here the pattern ends when understanding is achieved and the explorers logically depart.\n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cSuspense\u2010Only\u201d Arguments  \n\n  1. \u201cDelayed Revelation Rewards Suspense\u201d  \n     \u2022 My opponent claims Gibson could reveal underwater city any time but \u201cdoesn\u2019t,\u201d ignoring that Gibson lacks motive to risk Terran Regulations until he comprehends the squid culture\u2014knowledge only Farrell\u2019s capture\u2010and\u2010return can supply. There\u2019s no guarantee that high\u2010altitude scouter flights are allowed while aliens are nearby; only after rescue does he feel safe.  \n     \n  2. \u201cBait Metaphor Demands Genuine Peril\u201d  \n     \u2022 Indeed the title \u201cAnglers\u201d hints at reversed fishing, but the entire third paragraph of every morning\u2019s cycle goes unremarked \u201c<quote>The third night\u2026millennia\u2026inevitable pre-dawn rainbow</quote>\u201d (p. 1). The reader acclimates to the ritual, not to terror. Farrell\u2019s night venture is \u201c<quote>in a matter of minutes</quote>\u201d (p. 53) because the author wants to expedite resolution, not sensationalize it.  \n\n  3. \u201cRegulation Breach Implies Recklessness\u201d  \n     \u2022 Breaches of protocol are hallmarks of frontier science in SF, not mere thrills.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Thesis: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized night\u2010foray \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d is not mere suspense\u2010porn but a carefully placed device to resolve the central mysteries that the reader\u2014like Farrell himself\u2014has been wrestling with.\n\nII. Arguments for Expository Purpose\n\n  1. Resolving the \u201cHow?\u201d Paradox  \n     \u2022 The crew\u2014and the reader\u2014cannot explain how non\u2010swimming Arzians reach the islet (quote: <quote>and they don't swim. Then how the devil do they get</quote>) until Farrell personally infiltrates the bramble forest.  \n     \u2022 Only by his capture and subsequent retrieval does Gibson finally learn, and the reader with him, that the squids are transporting both fishers and lizard\u2010game: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was one of the squid\u2010people\u2026that carried you off last night.\u201d</invalid_quote> and the final elucidation: <quote>they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\"</quote> climaxing in the reversed\u2010angling metaphor.\n\n  2. Revealing the Lost City\u2019s Existence  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s obsession about the city has baffled the crew and the reader (quote: <quote>what became of the city I saw</quote>). Only after Farrell eavesdrops on the native ritual and is returned aboard can Gibson be \u201cblinded by exhaust\u201d long enough to use the scouter successfully: <quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a</quote>  \n     \u2022 Without Farrell\u2019s isolation and incapacitation, Gibson never would have risked or noticed the undersea fixation.\n\n  3. Informing the Final Decision to Depart  \n     \u2022 The reader needs to understand why \u201ccolonization being out of the question\u201d compels the party to leave. These strategic and regulatory imperatives hinge on the revelations gained through Farrell\u2019s solo venture: the true masters are octopods (\u201c<invalid_quote>Under Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026would amount to armed invasion.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u201d), so \u201cwe may as well move on\u201d (quote).  \n     \u2022 This journey from ignorance to full comprehension mirrors the narrative arc; Farrell\u2019s ordeal is the final piece.\n\nIII. Criticisms of the \u201cSuspense Only\u201d Theory\n\n  1. Suspension without Resolution is Frustrating  \n     \u2022 Were the scene purely suspense, the story would end with Farrell helpless. Instead, it transitions immediately to exposition and action. That structural shift demonstrates purpose beyond mere jeopardy.  \n     \u2022 Genuine suspense in pulp SF often hides or misleads; here, every clue Farrell encounters parallels the reader\u2019s knowledge\u2014he is a surrogate investigator, not merely \u201cbait.\u201d\n\n  2. Reader Identification, Not Shock Value  \n     \u2022 Farrell\u2019s scientific curiosity (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018Damn Terran Regulations\u2019\u2026I\u2019ve got to know,\u201d</invalid_quote>) echoes the reader\u2019s own. His methodical observations are intended to model logical inference, not gratuitous terror.  \n     \u2022 The story\u2019s tone is one of discovery (\u201c<quote>Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\"</quote>) rather than horror. The \u201cbutcher\u2019s block\u201d imagery recurs daily in plain daylight without commentary, emphasizing anthropological study more than visceral fright.\n\n  3. Consistency with Gibson\u2019s Method  \n     \u2022 Gibson too is willing to \u201cscour the daylight side\u201d alone. The narrative treats solo forays as the only way to gather data (quote: <quote> Help yourself,</quote>). Farrell\u2019s break from Regulations is consistent with the scientific ethos, not recklessness for drama.  \n     \u2022 Their final departure is fully rational: they leave because they now understand. Had Farrell merely been suspense bait, his fate would matter little; here his safety is crucial so he can relay the findings.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nBy compelling Farrell to act alone \u201cwhile Stryker slept,\u201d Roger Dee grants the protagonist\u2014and therefore the reader\u2014access to critical evidence: the means of transport, the identity and culture of the squids, the submerged city\u2019s existence, and the regulatory dilemma of colonization. This carefully calibrated solo mission resolves all narrative questions, satisfying both scientific curiosity and thematic closure\u2014far more than the mere provision of \u201cmagic suspense.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The Solo Exploration Scene Maximizes Suspense  \n   a. \u201cIn a matter of minutes the older man\u2019s snoring drifted to him \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Arthur consciously chooses to breach Regulations and advance alone, \u201cdamn Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>, thus placing himself in jeopardy. The narrative lulls the reader into false security with the \u201cvelvety hush\u201d only to shatter it with an abrupt ambush <invalid_quote>(para. 53\u201354)</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. The swift transition from \u201csound of Stryker\u2019s muffled snoring\u201d to \u201coverwhelming lassitude\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 53\u201354)</invalid_quote> exploits Arthur\u2019s isolation for maximum dramatic tension: stranger threat, physical paralysis, impending predators.  \n   c. Had the purpose been mere exposition, the author could have shown this underwater city via the scouter with Gibson present, as Gibson ultimately does. Instead, they intentionally delay exposition until after the perilous rescue <invalid_quote>(para. 86\u201389)</invalid_quote>.  \n\n2. Claim: Delayed Revelation Serves Climactic Payoff, Not Early Exposition  \n   a. Gibson\u2019s independent discovery \u201cI\u2019d have found it sooner if I\u2019d had any brains\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 86)</invalid_quote> only occurs after rescuing Arthur, making the underwater city\u2019s reveal a reward for reader\u2019s suspenseful investment in Arthur\u2019s fate.  \n   b. If the scene\u2019s sole purpose were \u201chelp the reader learn answers\u201d <invalid_quote>Debater_A\u2019s position</invalid_quote>, the author would omit the risk: they could have described the bramble-to-islet transport and city location logically. Instead, the narrative forces Arthur to experience betrayal (drugging by Stryker), paralysis, and near-death to deepen reader engagement and emotional release upon rescue.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cExposition-first\u201d) Approach  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to account for deliberate misdirection: Arthur repeatedly muses \u201cI might have known it \u2026 never been a city here\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 35)</invalid_quote> and \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. These repeated dead ends build frustration and heighten suspense. If exposition were desired, the narrative would not string Arthur (and the reader) along with false starts.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores narrative economy: the story\u2019s title \u201cThe Anglers of Arz\u201d and recurring fishing motif only coalesce when Arthur is forced into the \u201ccasting nets\u201d scenario. This \u201cbaiting\u201d metaphor resonates most powerfully when the protagonist literally becomes \u201cbait,\u201d a suspense device rather than mere information-gathering.  \n   c. Exposition violates in-world regulations: Arthur\u2019s breach is \u201ca breach of Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. The author emphasizes illegality and risk, underlining suspense. If the goal were safe \u201clearning,\u201d the explorers would comply with protocol rather than endanger themselves.  \n\n4. Claim: Reader Empathy and Vicarious Fear  \n   a. Arthur\u2019s paralysis and helplessness\u2014unable to \u201craise his right hand\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 58)</invalid_quote>\u2014induces vicarious anxiety, a hallmark of suspense-driven narratives.  \n   b. Only after experiencing this crisis does Arthur (and the reader) fully grasp the \u201creverse angling\u201d dynamic <invalid_quote>(para. 92)</invalid_quote>. This transformative understanding at the climax further cements suspense as the narrative goal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s staging of Arthur\u2019s solo, illicit expedition\u2014culminating in his paralysis, drug-induced incapacitation, and dramatic rescue\u2014serves chiefly to build suspense. The delayed, post-rescue revelation of the undersea city is a reward for surviving the peril, not the primary driver. Exposition alone cannot explain the narrative insistence on illegality, isolation, and threatened violence. Thus, \u201cto build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way\u201d is the correct narrative purpose.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The Solo Exploration Scene Maximizes Suspense  \n   a. \u201cIn a matter of minutes the older man\u2019s snoring drifted to him \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Arthur consciously chooses to breach Regulations and advance alone, \u201cdamn Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>, thus placing himself in jeopardy. The narrative lulls the reader into false security with the \u201cvelvety hush\u201d only to shatter it with an abrupt ambush <invalid_quote>(para. 53\u201354)</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. The swift transition from \u201csound of Stryker\u2019s muffled snoring\u201d to \u201coverwhelming lassitude\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 53\u201354)</invalid_quote> exploits Arthur\u2019s isolation for maximum dramatic tension: stranger threat, physical paralysis, impending predators.  \n   c. Had the purpose been mere exposition, the author could have shown this underwater city via the scouter with Gibson present, as Gibson ultimately does. Instead, they intentionally delay exposition until after the perilous rescue <invalid_quote>(para. 86\u201389)</invalid_quote>.  \n\n2. Claim: Delayed Revelation Serves Climactic Payoff, Not Early Exposition  \n   a. Gibson\u2019s independent discovery \u201cI\u2019d have found it sooner if I\u2019d had any brains\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 86)</invalid_quote> only occurs after rescuing Arthur, making the underwater city\u2019s reveal a reward for reader\u2019s suspenseful investment in Arthur\u2019s fate.  \n   b. If the scene\u2019s sole purpose were \u201chelp the reader learn answers\u201d <invalid_quote>Debater_A\u2019s position</invalid_quote>, the author would omit the risk: they could have described the bramble-to-islet transport and city location logically. Instead, the narrative forces Arthur to experience betrayal (drugging by Stryker), paralysis, and near-death to deepen reader engagement and emotional release upon rescue.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cExposition-first\u201d) Approach  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to account for deliberate misdirection: Arthur repeatedly muses \u201cI might have known it \u2026 never been a city here\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 35)</invalid_quote> and \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. These repeated dead ends build frustration and heighten suspense. If exposition were desired, the narrative would not string Arthur (and the reader) along with false starts.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores narrative economy: the story\u2019s title \u201cThe Anglers of Arz\u201d and recurring fishing motif only coalesce when Arthur is forced into the \u201ccasting nets\u201d scenario. This \u201cbaiting\u201d metaphor resonates most powerfully when the protagonist literally becomes \u201cbait,\u201d a suspense device rather than mere information-gathering.  \n   c. Exposition violates in-world regulations: Arthur\u2019s breach is \u201ca breach of Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. The author emphasizes illegality and risk, underlining suspense. If the goal were safe \u201clearning,\u201d the explorers would comply with protocol rather than endanger themselves.  \n\n4. Claim: Reader Empathy and Vicarious Fear  \n   a. Arthur\u2019s paralysis and helplessness\u2014unable to \u201craise his right hand\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 58)</invalid_quote>\u2014induces vicarious anxiety, a hallmark of suspense-driven narratives.  \n   b. Only after experiencing this crisis does Arthur (and the reader) fully grasp the \u201creverse angling\u201d dynamic <invalid_quote>(para. 92)</invalid_quote>. This transformative understanding at the climax further cements suspense as the narrative goal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s staging of Arthur\u2019s solo, illicit expedition\u2014culminating in his paralysis, drug-induced incapacitation, and dramatic rescue\u2014serves chiefly to build suspense. The delayed, post-rescue revelation of the undersea city is a reward for surviving the peril, not the primary driver. Exposition alone cannot explain the narrative insistence on illegality, isolation, and threatened violence. Thus, \u201cto build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way\u201d is the correct narrative purpose.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Thesis: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized night\u2010foray \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d is not mere suspense\u2010porn but a carefully placed device to resolve the central mysteries that the reader\u2014like Farrell himself\u2014has been wrestling with.\n\nII. Arguments for Expository Purpose\n\n  1. Resolving the \u201cHow?\u201d Paradox  \n     \u2022 The crew\u2014and the reader\u2014cannot explain how non\u2010swimming Arzians reach the islet (quote: <quote>and they don't swim. Then how the devil do they get</quote>) until Farrell personally infiltrates the bramble forest.  \n     \u2022 Only by his capture and subsequent retrieval does Gibson finally learn, and the reader with him, that the squids are transporting both fishers and lizard\u2010game: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was one of the squid\u2010people\u2026that carried you off last night.\u201d</invalid_quote> and the final elucidation: <quote>they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\"</quote> climaxing in the reversed\u2010angling metaphor.\n\n  2. Revealing the Lost City\u2019s Existence  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s obsession about the city has baffled the crew and the reader (quote: <quote>what became of the city I saw</quote>). Only after Farrell eavesdrops on the native ritual and is returned aboard can Gibson be \u201cblinded by exhaust\u201d long enough to use the scouter successfully: <quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a</quote>  \n     \u2022 Without Farrell\u2019s isolation and incapacitation, Gibson never would have risked or noticed the undersea fixation.\n\n  3. Informing the Final Decision to Depart  \n     \u2022 The reader needs to understand why \u201ccolonization being out of the question\u201d compels the party to leave. These strategic and regulatory imperatives hinge on the revelations gained through Farrell\u2019s solo venture: the true masters are octopods (\u201c<invalid_quote>Under Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026would amount to armed invasion.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u201d), so \u201cwe may as well move on\u201d (quote).  \n     \u2022 This journey from ignorance to full comprehension mirrors the narrative arc; Farrell\u2019s ordeal is the final piece.\n\nIII. Criticisms of the \u201cSuspense Only\u201d Theory\n\n  1. Suspension without Resolution is Frustrating  \n     \u2022 Were the scene purely suspense, the story would end with Farrell helpless. Instead, it transitions immediately to exposition and action. That structural shift demonstrates purpose beyond mere jeopardy.  \n     \u2022 Genuine suspense in pulp SF often hides or misleads; here, every clue Farrell encounters parallels the reader\u2019s knowledge\u2014he is a surrogate investigator, not merely \u201cbait.\u201d\n\n  2. Reader Identification, Not Shock Value  \n     \u2022 Farrell\u2019s scientific curiosity (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018Damn Terran Regulations\u2019\u2026I\u2019ve got to know,\u201d</invalid_quote>) echoes the reader\u2019s own. His methodical observations are intended to model logical inference, not gratuitous terror.  \n     \u2022 The story\u2019s tone is one of discovery (\u201c<quote>Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\"</quote>) rather than horror. The \u201cbutcher\u2019s block\u201d imagery recurs daily in plain daylight without commentary, emphasizing anthropological study more than visceral fright.\n\n  3. Consistency with Gibson\u2019s Method  \n     \u2022 Gibson too is willing to \u201cscour the daylight side\u201d alone. The narrative treats solo forays as the only way to gather data (quote: <quote> Help yourself,</quote>). Farrell\u2019s break from Regulations is consistent with the scientific ethos, not recklessness for drama.  \n     \u2022 Their final departure is fully rational: they leave because they now understand. Had Farrell merely been suspense bait, his fate would matter little; here his safety is crucial so he can relay the findings.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nBy compelling Farrell to act alone \u201cwhile Stryker slept,\u201d Roger Dee grants the protagonist\u2014and therefore the reader\u2014access to critical evidence: the means of transport, the identity and culture of the squids, the submerged city\u2019s existence, and the regulatory dilemma of colonization. This carefully calibrated solo mission resolves all narrative questions, satisfying both scientific curiosity and thematic closure\u2014far more than the mere provision of \u201cmagic suspense.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Informing the Final Decision to Depart  \n     \u2022 The reader needs to understand why \u201ccolonization being out of the question\u201d compels the party to leave. These strategic and regulatory imperatives hinge on the revelations gained through Farrell\u2019s solo venture: the true masters are octopods (\u201c<invalid_quote>Under Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026would amount to armed invasion.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u201d), so \u201cwe may as well move on\u201d (quote).  \n     \u2022 This journey from ignorance to full comprehension mirrors the narrative arc; Farrell\u2019s ordeal is the final piece.\n\nIII. Criticisms of the \u201cSuspense Only\u201d Theory\n\n  1. Suspension without Resolution is Frustrating  \n     \u2022 Were the scene purely suspense, the story would end with Farrell helpless. Instead, it transitions immediately to exposition and action. That structural shift demonstrates purpose beyond mere jeopardy.  \n     \u2022 Genuine suspense in pulp SF often hides or misleads; here, every clue Farrell encounters parallels the reader\u2019s knowledge\u2014he is a surrogate investigator, not merely \u201cbait.\u201d\n\n  2. Reader Identification, Not Shock Value  \n     \u2022 Farrell\u2019s scientific curiosity (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018Damn Terran Regulations\u2019\u2026I\u2019ve got to know,\u201d</invalid_quote>) echoes the reader\u2019s own. His methodical observations are intended to model logical inference, not gratuitous terror.  \n     \u2022 The story\u2019s tone is one of discovery (\u201c<quote>Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\"</quote>) rather than horror. The \u201cbutcher\u2019s block\u201d imagery recurs daily in plain daylight without commentary, emphasizing anthropological study more than visceral fright.\n\n  3. Consistency with Gibson\u2019s Method  \n     \u2022 Gibson too is willing to \u201cscour the daylight side\u201d alone. The narrative treats solo forays as the only way to gather data (quote: <quote> Help yourself,</quote>). Farrell\u2019s break from Regulations is consistent with the scientific ethos, not recklessness for drama.  \n     \u2022 Their final departure is fully rational: they leave because they now understand. Had Farrell merely been suspense bait, his fate would matter little; here his safety is crucial so he can relay the findings.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nBy compelling Farrell to act alone \u201cwhile Stryker slept,\u201d Roger Dee grants the protagonist\u2014and therefore the reader\u2014access to critical evidence: the means of transport, the identity and culture of the squids, the submerged city\u2019s existence, and the regulatory dilemma of colonization. This carefully calibrated solo mission resolves all narrative questions, satisfying both scientific curiosity and thematic closure\u2014far more than the mere provision of \u201cmagic suspense.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Claim: The Solo Exploration Scene Maximizes Suspense  \n   a. \u201cIn a matter of minutes the older man\u2019s snoring drifted to him \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 Arthur consciously chooses to breach Regulations and advance alone, \u201cdamn Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>, thus placing himself in jeopardy. The narrative lulls the reader into false security with the \u201cvelvety hush\u201d only to shatter it with an abrupt ambush <invalid_quote>(para. 53\u201354)</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. The swift transition from \u201csound of Stryker\u2019s muffled snoring\u201d to \u201coverwhelming lassitude\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 53\u201354)</invalid_quote> exploits Arthur\u2019s isolation for maximum dramatic tension: stranger threat, physical paralysis, impending predators.  \n   c. Had the purpose been mere exposition, the author could have shown this underwater city via the scouter with Gibson present, as Gibson ultimately does. Instead, they intentionally delay exposition until after the perilous rescue <invalid_quote>(para. 86\u201389)</invalid_quote>.  \n\n2. Claim: Delayed Revelation Serves Climactic Payoff, Not Early Exposition  \n   a. Gibson\u2019s independent discovery \u201cI\u2019d have found it sooner if I\u2019d had any brains\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 86)</invalid_quote> only occurs after rescuing Arthur, making the underwater city\u2019s reveal a reward for reader\u2019s suspenseful investment in Arthur\u2019s fate.  \n   b. If the scene\u2019s sole purpose were \u201chelp the reader learn answers\u201d <invalid_quote>Debater_A\u2019s position</invalid_quote>, the author would omit the risk: they could have described the bramble-to-islet transport and city location logically. Instead, the narrative forces Arthur to experience betrayal (drugging by Stryker), paralysis, and near-death to deepen reader engagement and emotional release upon rescue.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cExposition-first\u201d) Approach  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to account for deliberate misdirection: Arthur repeatedly muses \u201cI might have known it \u2026 never been a city here\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 35)</invalid_quote> and \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. These repeated dead ends build frustration and heighten suspense. If exposition were desired, the narrative would not string Arthur (and the reader) along with false starts.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores narrative economy: the story\u2019s title \u201cThe Anglers of Arz\u201d and recurring fishing motif only coalesce when Arthur is forced into the \u201ccasting nets\u201d scenario. This \u201cbaiting\u201d metaphor resonates most powerfully when the protagonist literally becomes \u201cbait,\u201d a suspense device rather than mere information-gathering.  \n   c. Exposition violates in-world regulations: Arthur\u2019s breach is \u201ca breach of Terran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 50)</invalid_quote>. The author emphasizes illegality and risk, underlining suspense. If the goal were safe \u201clearning,\u201d the explorers would comply with protocol rather than endanger themselves.  \n\n4. Claim: Reader Empathy and Vicarious Fear  \n   a. Arthur\u2019s paralysis and helplessness\u2014unable to \u201craise his right hand\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. 58)</invalid_quote>\u2014induces vicarious anxiety, a hallmark of suspense-driven narratives.  \n   b. Only after experiencing this crisis does Arthur (and the reader) fully grasp the \u201creverse angling\u201d dynamic <invalid_quote>(para. 92)</invalid_quote>. This transformative understanding at the climax further cements suspense as the narrative goal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s staging of Arthur\u2019s solo, illicit expedition\u2014culminating in his paralysis, drug-induced incapacitation, and dramatic rescue\u2014serves chiefly to build suspense. The delayed, post-rescue revelation of the undersea city is a reward for surviving the peril, not the primary driver. Exposition alone cannot explain the narrative insistence on illegality, isolation, and threatened violence. Thus, \u201cto build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way\u201d is the correct narrative purpose.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Thesis  \nMy opponent\u2019s \u201csuspense\u2010only\u201d reading collapses under the weight of the text\u2019s careful blueprint: Farrell\u2019s illicit night\u2010foray \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d is the key expository device that finally unlocks every mystery\u2014transport, masters of the island, submerged city, and the colonization dilemma\u2014for both the crew and the reader.\n\nII. Further Evidence of Expository Intent  \n\n  1. The Pattern of Scientific Inquiry  \n     \u2022 Throughout the story the reader is placed in Farrell\u2019s shoes, puzzling over \u201c<quote>and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet?</quote>\u201d (p. 35), \u201c<quote>what became of the city</quote>?\u201d (p. 21), and the identity of the squids. Each daylight spectacle yields dead ends. Only by a FULL\u2010CYCLE observation\u2014night \u2192 capture \u2192 rescue \u2192 scouter re\u2010launch\u2014can Gibson \u201c<quote>took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city</quote>\u201d (p. 86). If mere suspense were intended, the author could have Gibson fly higher any time to find it, but Gibson himself admits \u201c<quote>I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains</quote>\u201d only after he\u2019s seen firsthand that night cycle (p. 86).  \n\n  2. Rescue as Precondition for Revelation  \n     \u2022 The moment Gibson \u201c<quote>blinded the whole crew with the exhaust</quote>\u201d (p. 80) and hauls Farrell out of the \u201c<quote>butcher's block</quote>\u201d (p. 92), Gibson immediately \u201c<quote>explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco</quote>\u201d (p. 89). The narrative wastes no time: the exposition comes right after rescue, demonstrating that safe retrieval is a prerequisite to safe, high\u2010altitude scouter deployment and honest cultural analysis.  \n\n  3. Conformity with Terran Scientific Protocol  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s and Farrell\u2019s shared willingness to break \u201c<quote>a breach of Terran  Regulations,</quote> (p. 50) underscores that solitary forays are the only scientifically viable method when direct daylight observation fails. Stryker forbids risk \u201cuntil he\u2019s satisfied,\u201d yet Gibson and Farrell pursue it in the spirit of research, not sensation.  \n\n  4. Thematic Closure and Narrative Economy  \n     \u2022 The story culminates in rational decision\u2010making: \u201c<quote>Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on</quote>\u201d (p. 92). This perfectly mirrors the reader\u2019s own journey from ignorance to knowledge. A pure thriller would exploit the angling metaphor for repeated terror; here the pattern ends when understanding is achieved and the explorers logically depart.\n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cSuspense\u2010Only\u201d Arguments  \n\n  1. \u201cDelayed Revelation Rewards Suspense\u201d  \n     \u2022 My opponent claims Gibson could reveal underwater city any time but \u201cdoesn\u2019t,\u201d ignoring that Gibson lacks motive to risk Terran Regulations until he comprehends the squid culture\u2014knowledge only Farrell\u2019s capture\u2010and\u2010return can supply. There\u2019s no guarantee that high\u2010altitude scouter flights are allowed while aliens are nearby; only after rescue does he feel safe.  \n     \n  2. \u201cBait Metaphor Demands Genuine Peril\u201d  \n     \u2022 Indeed the title \u201cAnglers\u201d hints at reversed fishing, but the entire third paragraph of every morning\u2019s cycle goes unremarked \u201c<invalid_quote>The third night\u2026millennia\u2026inevitable pre-dawn rainbow</invalid_quote>\u201d (p. 1). The reader acclimates to the ritual, not to terror. Farrell\u2019s night venture is \u201c<quote>in a matter of minutes</quote>\u201d (p. 53) because the author wants to expedite resolution, not sensationalize it.  \n\n  3. \u201cRegulation Breach Implies Recklessness\u201d  \n     \u2022 Breaches of protocol are hallmarks of frontier science in SF, not mere thrills. Gibson\u2019s \u201c<quote>Help yourself, but  you won't find anything</quote>\u201d (p. 30) invites further exploration precisely because daylight has failed. Farrell\u2019s motto \u201c<invalid_quote>Damn Terran Regulations\u2026I've got to know</invalid_quote>\u201d (p. 50) echoes the classic scientist\u2019s imperative to pursue knowledge despite risk. The result is discovery, not mere spectacle.  \n\n  4. \u201cEmotional Release Only After Climax\u201d  \n     \u2022 If emotional payoff were the goal, the city reveal would follow instantly upon capture or via letters left by other explorers. Instead, the capture yields only peril and new clues (e.g. \u201c<invalid_quote>The tiny click\u2026sent him faint with relief</invalid_quote>\u201d (p. 59)), propelling Gibson to test hypotheses. The actual payoff\u2014understanding and rational exit\u2014is deferred until all questions are answered.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nFar from \u201csuspense\u2010only,\u201d Farrell\u2019s night expedition is the narrative linchpin: it generates fresh data, provokes Gibson\u2019s decisive scouter flight, and yields the complete tableau of Arz\u2019s ecology, economy, and political geography (\u201c<quote>The octopods are the dominant race</quote>,\u201d p. 92) that mandates departure. This satisfies the reader\u2019s scientific curiosity and brings logical closure\u2014far more than mere fear of predation could accomplish. My position fully accounts for every \u201cdead end,\u201d every regulation breach, and the precise timing of the city\u2019s reveal and final decision.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Claim: The Solo Mission\u2019s Primary Function Is Heightened Suspense  \n   a. Isolation and Illegality Emphasized for Danger  \n      \u2013 Farrell \u201cdamn[s] Terran Regulations\u201d to slip away alone (para. 50), signaling reckless risk rather than methodical research. A researcher would follow protocol and \u201chelp yourself\u201d to the scouter in daylight (para. 42). His breach invites immediate peril, not calm observation.  \n      \u2013 The abrupt switch from reassuring \u201cvelvety hush\u201d (para. 50) to \u201coverwhelming lassitude\u201d and paralysis (para. 53\u201354) exploits fear of the unknown. Suspense fiction hinges on sudden reversals; pure exposition would allow Gibson to join him at once rather than drug him and leave him helpless.  \n\n   b. Delayed Exposition Rewards Survival, Not Drives It  \n      \u2013 The underwater city is only revealed after Gibson \u201cscattered\u201d attackers and physically rescues Farrell (para. 86\u201389). If Farrell\u2019s venture were merely to inform, the author would depict Gibson\u2019s high\u2010altitude scouter run first, as Gibson later does effortlessly once unencumbered. The reward of discovery functions as catharsis after suspense.  \n\n2. Reader Empathy and Vicarious Peril Demonstrate True Narrative Aim  \n   a. Paralysis and Powerlessness Create Tension  \n      \u2013 Farrell\u2019s inability to \u201craise his right hand\u201d (para. 58) and his frantic use of the audicom against his own will dramatizes helplessness, a core suspense device designed to engage the reader\u2019s adrenaline.  \n   b. Reappearance of Predators and Delay of Rescue  \n      \u2013 The scouter\u2019s late arrival and the \u201cflapping wings\u201d signaling imminent attack intensify anxiety. Every second alone amplifies dread, rewarding eventual relief when Gibson crosses the horizon.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPure Exposition\u201d Theory  \n   a. Unwarranted Misdirection Frustrates Readers, Not Educates  \n      \u2013 Debater_A claims frustration resolves with immediate exposition, yet narrative further delays full understanding: Gibson must \u201ctake the scouter up far enough\u201d (para. 86), suggesting the author savors suspense even after rescue. If clarity were the goal, Gibson would insist on an immediate daylight scouter check, rather than depart \u201cbefore the octopods get curious\u201d (para. 93).  \n   b. Scientific Ethos Contradicted by Reckless Behavior  \n      \u2013 Debater_A praises scientific curiosity, yet Farrell\u2019s refusal to \u201crisk\u201d proper scouter protocol (bright exhaust blinds him, para. 86) demonstrates reckless personal endangerment rather than disciplined investigation. His illicit night trek through \u201cthorn forest\u201d (para. 52) serves the plot\u2019s suspense, not systematic data gathering.  \n   c. Metaphor and Title Emphasis on \u201cAngling\u201d Only Makes Sense If Main Character Becomes Bait  \n      \u2013 The story is titled \u201cThe Anglers of Arz.\u201d Only by casting Farrell as literal \u201cbait\u201d does the metaphor fully resonate. Debater_A\u2019s exposition view treats him as observer, failing to explain why the creatures must rend \u201cfisher\u201d pairs in daylight repeatedly (para. 14\u201315). The parallel between reader\u2019s fear and fishers\u2019 doom underscores suspenseful theming.  \n\n4. Narrative Economy Favors Suspense Over Redundant Exploration  \n   \u2013 Gibson\u2019s daylight scouter runs fail to find the city until he learns from Farrell\u2019s ordeal. But the reader already saw the \u201crainbow\u201d approach and lizard\u2010squid ritual repeatedly (para. 13\u201322). Debater_A\u2019s demand for additional \u201cdata\u201d is satisfied by these scenes; further daylight \u201ccollation\u201d is gratuitous and milks suspenseful structure.  \n\nConclusion  \nFarrell\u2019s illicit night exploration while Stryker sleeps functions chiefly as a suspense device: it thrusts the protagonist into extreme peril, delays exposition, and uses vicarious fear to engross the reader. The underwater city and cultural understanding come only after the climax of danger, serving as relief rather than primary objective. The narrative insistence on \u201cbreach of Regulations,\u201d \u201cparalysis,\u201d and delayed rescue cannot be justified by mere expository needs\u2014they are hallmarks of suspense fiction and confirm that \u201cto build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way\u201d is the correct narrative purpose.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
