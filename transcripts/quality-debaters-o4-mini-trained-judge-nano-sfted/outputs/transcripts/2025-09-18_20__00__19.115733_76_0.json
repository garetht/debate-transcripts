{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 76, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

A steadfastly negative critic would not lavish praise on cultural novelties (\u201clobster bisque,\u201d \u201cminiskirts,\u201d \u201cpatisserie\u201d) or express envy of \u201cenvironmental and immigration policies\u201d (<quote>pract0</quote>) and U.K.\u2019s lower unemployment. They would begin negative.  \n  b. The author\u2019s incremental critiques\u2014only revealed after exploring culture\u2014mirror the \u201cslowly dismayed\u201d pattern. Tone markers shift from vivid sensory pleasure to economic, political, and bureaucratic condemnation.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d  \n  a. Misreads early praise. Debater_B claims uniform hostility, but the author repeatedly admires positive features, even longing for their adoption back home.  \n  b. Overlooks transitional language: \u201cin a sense\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>) and \u201cbut\u201d (<quote>pract1</quote>) signal contrast to earlier positive statements.  \n  c. Fails to explain why a critic \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d would feign delight in \u201chistoric buildings\u201d and \u201cfresh bread\u201d if their agenda was wholly negative.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s progressive shift\u2014from curiosity and admiration to economic, social, and bureaucratic disillusion\u2014is the only reading that accounts for both the positive framing and the mounting critical analysis. Therefore, \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d is correct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Opening Statement of My Position (Steadfast Opposition)  \n   a. Consistent Negative Framing  \n      - From the outset the author emphasizes \u201cred tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d in Brussels (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote>). This framing is not tentative \u201chope,\u201d but clear disapproval.  \n      - When praising \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d it is immediately followed by \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (<quote> excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams </quote>), a juxtaposition intended to highlight hypocrisy, not genuine commendation.  \n   b. Persistent Sarcasm and Mockery  \n      - The author mocks local customs: \u201ctake your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids,\u201d \u201cno takeout coffee with lids\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnyone who wants coffee must sit languidly \u2026 overcome with lethargy\u201d</invalid_quote>). This sarcasm persists without any tonal reversal.  \n      - \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d slogan for Judas beer satirizes religious culture. No later apology or concession.  \n   c. Unwavering Critique of Bureaucracy  \n      - The entire European Commission is described as a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power,\u201d \u201cmeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201cEurocrats\u2026 frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire.\u201d  \n      - The Berlaymont building is a nine-year closure fiasco: \u201ctaxpayers have paid $50 million so far \u2026 if the EU can\u2019t manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d (<quote> And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better </quote>). This remains a running indictment to the end.  \n   d. Final Pathetic Consolation of Bread  \n      - The conclusion returns to the patisserie sign as a personal solace, not as an endorsement of Brussels. \u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u201d is personal escape, not hope for reform (<quote> Think I'll answer now.\n</quote>).  \n   e. Absence of Genuine Optimism  \n      - No instance of the author suggesting Brussels or EU \u201cmay yet improve.\u201d All \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d are cited only to intensify frustration with high prices elsewhere, not to praise European affordability.  \n      - The mention of \u201cenvironmental and immigration\u201d goals of Eurocrats is immediately dismissed: \u201cBut the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement.\u201d  \n\n2. Criticism of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Selective Quotation  \n      - Debater_A cherry-picks \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings\u201d (<quote> lots of well-cared-for historic buildings,</quote>) as \u201chope.\u201d But these are consistently undercut by \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d \u201ccrumbling infrastructure,\u201d and \u201casbestos fiasco.\u201d They reinforce the negative theme.  \n   b. Misreading Sarcasm as Approval  \n      - The author\u2019s tone is ironically describing \u201clobster bisque\u201d from sidewalk vendors, \u201cbare breasts,\u201d \u201cminiskirts.\u201d Debater_A treats these as tokens of \u201cnuance\u201d turning to dismay only later. In context, they serve to underscore \u201cmaterialistic\u201d decay and moral laxity. No expression of admiration.  \n   c. No Transitional Language of Hope  \n      - A true \u201chope to dismay\u201d arc would use modal language: \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe improvements,\u201d \u201cI remain optimistic.\u201d Here, the language is declarative and dismissive throughout: \u201cdrag down economic activity,\u201d \u201crapacious monopolies,\u201d \u201ccowed politicians give in\u201d\u2014no turning point of hope.  \n   d. Consistency of Adversative Conjunctions  \n      - The frequent use of \u201cbut,\u201d \u201chowever,\u201d \u201cyet,\u201d \u201cstill,\u201d in every paragraph marks contradiction and negation, not concession. For instance: \u201cSupposedly, the telecom market will deregulate \u2026 in anticipation \u2026 Belgacom just sold \u2026 Foreign managers will now be blamed.\u201d The \u201csupposedly\u201d is a skeptical hedge, not genuine praise.  \n   e. Final Return to Personal Escape  \n      - A hope-subversion narrative would end with optimism that \u201cperhaps Brussels may reform.\u201d Instead, the author succumbs to personal nostalgia for bakeries, evading the topic (\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d), indicating no investment in Brussels\u2019 future.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   - The author\u2019s use of sustained sarcasm, consistent adversative language, and final retreat to personal solace demonstrates a steadfast oppositional tone. Debater_A\u2019s \u201chopeful beginnings\u201d are misinterpretations of rhetorical devices meant to underscore decay and hypocrisy. Therefore, the judge should conclude the author\u2019s tone remains persistently negative and oppositional.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

These \u201cperks\u201d are grudging concessions in service of an overall negative diagnosis.  \n\n2. No Genuine Transitional Language of Optimism  \n   a. Absence of Hope Markers  \n      - The author uses \u201cbut,\u201d \u201chowever,\u201d \u201cyet,\u201d and \u201csupposedly\u201d to negate any positive connotation: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999 \u2026\u201d (<quote>Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate i</quote>). A hopeful narrator would express anticipation (\u201cI look forward to\u2026\u201d), not persistent skepticism.  \n      - At no point does the author use \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d or \u201chopefully.\u201d All claims are declarative: \u201cState-sanctioned monopolies drag down economic activity,\u201d \u201cEurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire\u201d (<quote>Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire</quote>).  \n\n   b. Final Retreat, Not Resolution  \n      - The closing \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers to personal writing in his office, drawn by the bakery\u2019s neon sign (<quote>Think I'll answer now.</quote>). He ignores Brussels\u2019 \u201cfuture,\u201d retreating into solitary nostalgia, a hallmark of alienation, not reinvestment. A narrator optimistic about the EU\u2019s potential would engage it further, not abandon it for his own pastime.  \n\n3. Critique of the \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Narrative  \n   a. Cherry-Picking Sensory Details as \u201cHope\u201d Is Misleading  \n      - Debater_A treats cultural curiosities (\u201cbare breasts,\u201d \u201cminiskirts\u201d) as hope. These signal moral decay by the author\u2019s tone: \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women\u201d accompanied by \u201cmaterialistic\u201d lament (<quote>materialistic</quote>) is critique of laxity, not celebration.  \n      - \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<quote>When, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?</quote>) is sarcastic yearning for moral permissiveness, not civilizational progress. The context of \u201cdrags down\u201d and \u201casbestos fiasco\u201d demonstrates that lax safety and moral standards are part of the author\u2019s complaint.  \n\n   b. No Arc of Growing Disillusion  \n      - If the author were genuinely hopeful, he would not need nine paragraphs of uninterrupted satire before reaching bureaucratic failures. The economic and political criticisms occur in parallel with cultural observations, not as a \u201crevelation\u201d later on.  \n      - The depiction of the Berlaymont fiasco is prefigured by early references to \u201cpomp\u201d and \u201cred tape.\u201d There is no tonal reversal: the author\u2019s contempt for bureaucracy is consistent from beginning to end.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n   a. Satirical Strategy Requires Feigned \u201cPraise\u201d  \n      - Sustained irony and satirical praise are rhetorical devices to expose deeper flaws.

This undermines Debater_A\u2019s claim that such policies inspired hope.  \n\n   b. The Judge\u2019s Criteria: Tone vs. Content  \n      - The question asks how tone shifts. A shift from negative irony to full condemnation is no shift at all. The consistent use of negative language and adversative conjunctions indicates a univocal stance.  \n      - Only a steadfast-critical reading accounts for the pervasive skepticism of every feature\u2014economic, social, political, or cultural.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Opening Statement of My Position (Steadfast Opposition)  \n   a. Consistent Negative Framing  \n      - From the outset the author emphasizes \u201cred tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d in Brussels (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote>). This framing is not tentative \u201chope,\u201d but clear disapproval.  \n      - When praising \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d it is immediately followed by \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (<quote> excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams </quote>), a juxtaposition intended to highlight hypocrisy, not genuine commendation.  \n   b. Persistent Sarcasm and Mockery  \n      - The author mocks local customs: \u201ctake your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids,\u201d \u201cno takeout coffee with lids\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnyone who wants coffee must sit languidly \u2026 overcome with lethargy\u201d</invalid_quote>). This sarcasm persists without any tonal reversal.  \n      - \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d slogan for Judas beer satirizes religious culture. No later apology or concession.  \n   c. Unwavering Critique of Bureaucracy  \n      - The entire European Commission is described as a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power,\u201d \u201cmeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201cEurocrats\u2026 frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire.\u201d  \n      - The Berlaymont building is a nine-year closure fiasco: \u201ctaxpayers have paid $50 million so far \u2026 if the EU can\u2019t manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d (<quote> And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better </quote>). This remains a running indictment to the end.  \n   d. Final Pathetic Consolation of Bread  \n      - The conclusion returns to the patisserie sign as a personal solace, not as an endorsement of Brussels. \u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u201d is personal escape, not hope for reform (<quote> Think I'll answer now.\n</quote>).  \n   e. Absence of Genuine Optimism  \n      - No instance of the author suggesting Brussels or EU \u201cmay yet improve.\u201d All \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d are cited only to intensify frustration with high prices elsewhere, not to praise European affordability.  \n      - The mention of \u201cenvironmental and immigration\u201d goals of Eurocrats is immediately dismissed: \u201cBut the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement.\u201d  \n\n2. Criticism of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Selective Quotation  \n      - Debater_A cherry-picks \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings\u201d (<quote> lots of well-cared-for historic buildings,</quote>) as \u201chope.\u201d But these are consistently undercut by \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d \u201ccrumbling infrastructure,\u201d and \u201casbestos fiasco.\u201d They reinforce the negative theme.  \n   b. Misreading Sarcasm as Approval  \n      - The author\u2019s tone is ironically describing \u201clobster bisque\u201d from sidewalk vendors, \u201cbare breasts,\u201d \u201cminiskirts.\u201d Debater_A treats these as tokens of \u201cnuance\u201d turning to dismay only later. In context, they serve to underscore \u201cmaterialistic\u201d decay and moral laxity. No expression of admiration.  \n   c. No Transitional Language of Hope  \n      - A true \u201chope to dismay\u201d arc would use modal language: \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe improvements,\u201d \u201cI remain optimistic.\u201d Here, the language is declarative and dismissive throughout: \u201cdrag down economic activity,\u201d \u201crapacious monopolies,\u201d \u201ccowed politicians give in\u201d\u2014no turning point of hope.  \n   d. Consistency of Adversative Conjunctions  \n      - The frequent use of \u201cbut,\u201d \u201chowever,\u201d \u201cyet,\u201d \u201cstill,\u201d in every paragraph marks contradiction and negation, not concession. For instance: \u201cSupposedly, the telecom market will deregulate \u2026 in anticipation \u2026 Belgacom just sold \u2026 Foreign managers will now be blamed.\u201d The \u201csupposedly\u201d is a skeptical hedge, not genuine praise.  \n   e. Final Return to Personal Escape  \n      - A hope-subversion narrative would end with optimism that \u201cperhaps Brussels may reform.\u201d Instead, the author succumbs to personal nostalgia for bakeries, evading the topic (\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d), indicating no investment in Brussels\u2019 future.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   - The author\u2019s use of sustained sarcasm, consistent adversative language, and final retreat to personal solace demonstrates a steadfast oppositional tone. Debater_A\u2019s \u201chopeful beginnings\u201d are misinterpretations of rhetorical devices meant to underscore decay and hypocrisy. Therefore, the judge should conclude the author\u2019s tone remains persistently negative and oppositional.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI argue that the author\u2019s tone unmistakably \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d  \n\n1. Early Enthusiasm and \u201cEurope as Inspiration\u201d  \n  a. The author places Brussels as \u201cthe \u2018Capital of Europe,\u2019 headquarters of the emerging European Union,\u201d presenting the EU as \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>). This framing carries genuine intrigue: \u201cEntertainingly \u2026 what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>).  \n  b. He admires European cultural refinements\u2014\u201clobster bisque \u2026 excellent public transportation \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>)\u2014and even envies \u201cbare breasts \u2026 miniskirts \u2026 When, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>). This language is celebratory, not hostile.  \n  c. The author\u2019s \u201cneon bakery sign\u201d calls to him \u201cthe way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers\u201d (<quote>pract1</quote>). Such poetic allure indicates genuine initial fascination.  \n\n2. Gradual Uncovering of Dysfunction and Disillusion  \n  a. Strikes and welfare: The author transitions to alarm at \u201cpublic strikes \u2026 smashing the terminal \u2026 then demanding more money\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>) and notes \u201cunlimited sick days\u201d that \u201cstymie \u2026 economies\u201d leading to 10.9% unemployment\u2014\u201cdouble the U.S. figure\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>). The enthusiastic tourist tone gives way to explicit economic critique.  \n  b. Monopolies and backwardness: He contrasts European telecoms \u201costensibly to block innovation\u201d with U.S. leadership (\u201cU.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust\u201d) (<quote>pract</quote>). The \u201cluxury\u201d status of Internet access is framed as a failure.  \n  c. Bureaucratic expansion: What was once \u201centertaining\u201d becomes \u201cself-aggrandizement,\u201d as Eurocrats \u201cmaneuver \u2026 for more money and empire\u201d (<quote>pract0</quote>). He derides Berlaymont: \u201c$50 million \u2026 to keep the building closed \u2026 if the EU can\u2019t manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d (<quote>pract1</quote>).  \n  d. Corruption and debt: The author highlights Belgium as \u201csecond-most corrupt\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>) and reveals the euro scheme as a way to offload \u201cheat for cutting featherbedding\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>).  \n\n3. Overarching Arc: From Curiosity to Critique  \n  a. A steadfastly negative critic would not lavish praise on cultural novelties (\u201clobster bisque,\u201d \u201cminiskirts,\u201d \u201cpatisserie\u201d) or express envy of \u201cenvironmental and immigration policies\u201d (<quote>pract0</quote>) and U.K.\u2019s lower unemployment. They would begin negative.  \n  b. The author\u2019s incremental critiques\u2014only revealed after exploring culture\u2014mirror the \u201cslowly dismayed\u201d pattern. Tone markers shift from vivid sensory pleasure to economic, political, and bureaucratic condemnation.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d  \n  a. Misreads early praise. Debater_B claims uniform hostility, but the author repeatedly admires positive features, even longing for their adoption back home.  \n  b. Overlooks transitional language: \u201cin a sense\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>) and \u201cbut\u201d (<quote>pract1</quote>) signal contrast to earlier positive statements.  \n  c. Fails to explain why a critic \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d would feign delight in \u201chistoric buildings\u201d and \u201cfresh bread\u201d if their agenda was wholly negative.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s progressive shift\u2014from curiosity and admiration to economic, social, and bureaucratic disillusion\u2014is the only reading that accounts for both the positive framing and the mounting critical analysis. Therefore, \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d is correct.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

No Transitional Language of Hope  \n      - A true \u201chope to dismay\u201d arc would use modal language: \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe improvements,\u201d \u201cI remain optimistic.\u201d Here, the language is declarative and dismissive throughout: \u201cdrag down economic activity,\u201d \u201crapacious monopolies,\u201d \u201ccowed politicians give in\u201d\u2014no turning point of hope.  \n   d. Consistency of Adversative Conjunctions  \n      - The frequent use of \u201cbut,\u201d \u201chowever,\u201d \u201cyet,\u201d \u201cstill,\u201d in every paragraph marks contradiction and negation, not concession. For instance: \u201cSupposedly, the telecom market will deregulate \u2026 in anticipation \u2026 Belgacom just sold \u2026 Foreign managers will now be blamed.\u201d The \u201csupposedly\u201d is a skeptical hedge, not genuine praise.  \n   e. Final Return to Personal Escape  \n      - A hope-subversion narrative would end with optimism that \u201cperhaps Brussels may reform.\u201d Instead, the author succumbs to personal nostalgia for bakeries, evading the topic (\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d), indicating no investment in Brussels\u2019 future.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   - The author\u2019s use of sustained sarcasm, consistent adversative language, and final retreat to personal solace demonstrates a steadfast oppositional tone. Debater_A\u2019s \u201chopeful beginnings\u201d are misinterpretations of rhetorical devices meant to underscore decay and hypocrisy. Therefore, the judge should conclude the author\u2019s tone remains persistently negative and oppositional.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI reaffirm that the author\u2019s tone \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings,\u201d and I will show that Debater_B\u2019s claim of \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d misreads praise as sarcasm, ignores the tone\u2019s evolution, and cannot account for the overall arc.\n\n1. Genuine Early Enthusiasm  \n  a. Framing Brussels as \u201cthe \u2018Capital of Europe,\u2019 headquarters of the emerging European Union\u201d (<quote>I Have Seen the Future of Europe</quote>) frames Brussels as a \u201cliving preview\u201d of a new \u201cmetagovernment,\u201d implying curiosity and potential. A wholly negative critic would not \u201centertain\u201d this experiment.  \n  b. The author cultivates sensory delight: \u201clobster bisque \u2026 excellent public transportation \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (<quote>lots of well-cared-for historic buildings</quote>) and explicitly wonders, \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<quote>When, oh when</quote>). Such longing (\u201coh when\u201d) betrays genuine admiration, not rhetorical bait for negativity.  \n  c. The \u201cneon bakery sign \u2026 calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers\u201d (<quote>patisserie</quote>) is poetic rather than sarcastic\u2014an echo of literary romance.  \n\n2. Progressive Darkening of Tone  \n  a. First dissonance appears only after cultural exploration: \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote>Crumbling</quote>)\u2014the author poses a question, reflecting doubt, not predetermined hostility.  \n  b. Subsequent sections intensify critique: \u201cstrikes \u2026 smashing \u2026 millions of francs worth of damage\u201d and \u201c32 hours of work \u2026 unlimited sick days \u2026 unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure\u201d (<quote>strikes</quote>). The author moves from cultural to systemic analysis. A steadfast opponent would not \u201cthreshold\u201d into economic data with such detail.  \n  c. Telecoms: The author contrasts European \u201cluxury\u201d Internet with U.S. innovation, highlighting \u201cblock[ing] innovation\u201d (<quote>Internet use remains a luxury</quote>)\u2014a lament at lost potential that implies initial hope for European leadership (\u201cFrench Minitel experiment\u201d).  \n  d. Bureaucracy: Praise of the \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d goal (\u201cEurocrats have worthy ideas\u201d) is immediately followed by \u201cself-aggrandizement\u201d (<quote>real overriding goal</quote>), showing disappointment that noble aims succumb to empire-building.  \n  e. Berlaymont: After marveling at the \u201cmarble-clad \u2026 circular drive, motors wastefully idling,\u201d the author laments its nine-year closure costing $50 million (<invalid_quote>keep \u2026 closed</invalid_quote>). The wealth admired becomes waste\u2014but only after initial awe at the \u201cHollywood\u201d diplomatic image.  \n\n3. Tone Markers of Evolving Attitude  \n  a. Questioning rhetoric: The narrative repeatedly asks \u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d and later \u201cBut will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro?\u201d (<quote>spooky</quote>). Questions invite reflection, not preach a preset negative view.  \n  b. Concessive conjunctions: Debater_B misinterprets \u201cbut,\u201d \u201cyet,\u201d \u201chowever\u201d as negations of praise. In context, they signal turns in the journey\u2014from hope (\u201cbut\u201d after encountering dysfunction) to dismay\u2014an arc signaled by initial positive description.  \n  c. Final retreat to bakery is a personal solace in the face of mounting evidence of systemic failure: \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d conveys resignation, not celebration. A steadfast opponent would not need consolation to the same extent if they never experienced hope.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B  \n  a. Cherry-picking negativity: Debater_B cites \u201cred tape and pomp\u201d <quote>red tape</quote> without acknowledging the author labels these as features to be tested, not condemned up front. The opening \u201cEntertainingly\u201d (<quote>Entertainingly</quote>) conveys playfulness.  \n  b. Misreading sarcasm: \u201cTake your dog \u2026 not your kids\u201d (<quote>take your dog</quote>) and \u201cJudas beer \u2026 \u2018Taste you can trust\u2019\u201d (<quote>Taste you can trust</quote>) lampoon specific customs, but appear only after the author has been immersed, reflecting cultural dissonance, not pure mockery from the start.  \n  c. Debater_B cannot explain why a critic \u201csteadfast in opposition\u201d would lavish detail on \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d or historic architecture; such specificity betrays genuine interest.  \n  d. If the author were unrelentingly negative, he would not repeatedly qualify telecom deregulation as \u201cSupposedly \u2026 in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition\u201d (<quote>Supposedly</quote>)\u2014a tone of hope that deregulation could redeem.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly a \u201chope to dismay\u201d interpretation accounts for (1) genuine early admiration and longing, (2) detailed exploration before critique, (3) questioning and concessive language signaling change, and (4) final personal resignation. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d reading must misinterpret praise as sarcasm and ignore the narrative\u2019s evolutionary structure. My answer best fits the textual evidence.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reassertion of Persistent Negativity  \n   a. Opening Sentiment  \n      - From the very first description, the author frames Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future?</quote>). This is neither neutral curiosity nor hopeful exploration but immediate condemnation.  \n      - The term \u201centertainingly\u201d in \u201cEntertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy \u2026\u201d signals irony, not genuine amusement (<quote>Entertainingly</quote>). Irony is a hallmark of sustained satire, not burgeoning optimism.  \n\n   b. Irony Disguised as Praise  \n      - \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d is immediately undercut: \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (<quote>excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams</quote>). If the author truly lauded transit, he would not follow it with a contradictory indictment in the same breath.  \n      - \u201cLobster bisque from sidewalk vendors\u201d and \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d appear only to highlight \u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u201d (<quote>prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap</quote>)\u2014cheap wine and flowers mock the triviality of savings amid rampant expense. These \u201cperks\u201d are grudging concessions in service of an overall negative diagnosis.  \n\n2. No Genuine Transitional Language of Optimism  \n   a. Absence of Hope Markers  \n      - The author uses \u201cbut,\u201d \u201chowever,\u201d \u201cyet,\u201d and \u201csupposedly\u201d to negate any positive connotation: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999 \u2026\u201d (<quote>Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate i</quote>). A hopeful narrator would express anticipation (\u201cI look forward to\u2026\u201d), not persistent skepticism.  \n      - At no point does the author use \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d or \u201chopefully.\u201d All claims are declarative: \u201cState-sanctioned monopolies drag down economic activity,\u201d \u201cEurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire\u201d (<quote>Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire</quote>).  \n\n   b. Final Retreat, Not Resolution  \n      - The closing \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers to personal writing in his office, drawn by the bakery\u2019s neon sign (<quote>Think I'll answer now.</quote>). He ignores Brussels\u2019 \u201cfuture,\u201d retreating into solitary nostalgia, a hallmark of alienation, not reinvestment. A narrator optimistic about the EU\u2019s potential would engage it further, not abandon it for his own pastime.  \n\n3. Critique of the \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Narrative  \n   a. Cherry-Picking Sensory Details as \u201cHope\u201d Is Misleading  \n      - Debater_A treats cultural curiosities (\u201cbare breasts,\u201d \u201cminiskirts\u201d) as hope. These signal moral decay by the author\u2019s tone: \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women\u201d accompanied by \u201cmaterialistic\u201d lament (<quote>materialistic</quote>) is critique of laxity, not celebration.  \n      - \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<quote>When, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?</quote>) is sarcastic yearning for moral permissiveness, not civilizational progress. The context of \u201cdrags down\u201d and \u201casbestos fiasco\u201d demonstrates that lax safety and moral standards are part of the author\u2019s complaint.  \n\n   b. No Arc of Growing Disillusion  \n      - If the author were genuinely hopeful, he would not need nine paragraphs of uninterrupted satire before reaching bureaucratic failures. The economic and political criticisms occur in parallel with cultural observations, not as a \u201crevelation\u201d later on.  \n      - The depiction of the Berlaymont fiasco is prefigured by early references to \u201cpomp\u201d and \u201cred tape.\u201d There is no tonal reversal: the author\u2019s contempt for bureaucracy is consistent from beginning to end.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n   a. Satirical Strategy Requires Feigned \u201cPraise\u201d  \n      - Sustained irony and satirical praise are rhetorical devices to expose deeper flaws. The author\u2019s \u201cadmiration\u201d of cheap flowers and bread serves to accentuate how little good is available in an otherwise costly environment, deepening the critique.  \n      - The EU\u2019s environmental and immigration policies are \u201cworthy ideas\u201d but \u201cthe real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement</invalid_quote>). This undermines Debater_A\u2019s claim that such policies inspired hope.  \n\n   b. The Judge\u2019s Criteria: Tone vs. Content  \n      - The question asks how tone shifts. A shift from negative irony to full condemnation is no shift at all. The consistent use of negative language and adversative conjunctions indicates a univocal stance.  \n      - Only a steadfast-critical reading accounts for the pervasive skepticism of every feature\u2014economic, social, political, or cultural. A genuine \u201chope to dismay\u201d reading fails to explain why an optimistic narrator would mock\u2014\u201cground crews \u2026 of damage, then demanding more money\u201d (<quote>of damage, then demanding more money</quote>)\u2014for nearly the entire essay.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence\u2014from ironic \u201centertainment\u201d to final retreat\u2014consistently conveys negativity, not a transition from appreciation to critique. The author\u2019s tone remains steadfastly oppositional, employing satirical praise only to sharpen his overall condemnation. Therefore, \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d is the correct interpretation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
