    "background_text": "My Father's Estate \n\n         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: \"I saw that your father had died,\" she wrote. \"He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n",

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the things the author says can\u2019t easily be valued?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The values that his children cherish\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The values that his children cherish\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The values that his children cherish\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the things the author says can\u2019t easily be valued?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The values that his children cherish\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the things the author says can\u2019t easily be valued?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The values that his children cherish\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The values that his children cherish\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued\u201d refer to the intangible values and legacies my father left, not merely physical property.  \n   a. Evidence: <quote> The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax.</quote> (\u00b68) and <invalid_quote>\u201ccannot be taxed \u2026 cannot be taken \u2026 cannot be passed on \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6\u00b69, 16, 17, 24). Only intangibles escape appraisal and taxation.  \n   b. Reasoning: The entire essay contrasts taxable bank accounts, furniture, letters, degrees (all appraised) with loyalty, gratitude, prudence, reassurance, devotion, and reputation\u2014all priceless and nonmarketable. The rhetorical thrust is that these intangibles are the true inheritance.  \n\n2. Claim: Material items \u201cmeaningful to the family\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position) are precisely what the IRS can and must value.  \n   a. Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cThere are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father\u2019s books\u2026 furniture\u2026 clothes\u2026 mementos\u2026 love letters\u2026 I suppose we\u2019ll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b67)  \n   b. Objection to Debater_B: By their own nature these items are appraised and taxed, so they do not \u201cbeat the estate tax.\u201d They are \u201cdusty files,\u201d \u201cbargain-basement furniture,\u201d \u201chardly a writer for the large audience\u201d (\u00b63,7). If Debater_B\u2019s answer were correct, there would be no rhetorical contrast of \u201cvaluable estate\u201d vs. IRS. The author\u2019s point hinges on intangibles escaping \u201cmarginal rate of 55 percent\u201d (\u00b63).  \n\n3. Claim: The repeated enumeration of intangible qualities underscores their centrality.  \n   a. Loyalty: Saved Ron Hoffman from dismissal (\u00b69). Extended tenure to support Nixon (\u00b610).  \n   b. Gratitude & Appreciation of America & Art: \u201cThis quality \u2026 cannot be taxed\u201d (\u00b611).  \n   c. Prudence & Reassurance: Advice about risk, fallback support, \u201cIRS taxes it at zero\u201d (\u00b613).  \n   d. Devotion & Reassurance to descendants: \u201cworth far more\u2026 cannot be taken\u2026 pass it on\u2026 without surcharge\u201d (\u00b616).  \n   e. Reputation & Good Name: \u201ccannot be taxed\u2026 priceless, incalculable in value\u201d (\u00b617).  \n\n4. Logical structure of essay:  \n   \u2013 Opening question: \u201cDid he figure out a way around the estate tax?\u201d (\u00b61)  \n   \u2013 Listing of all things taxed.  \n   \u2013 Declaration: \u201cthe really valuable estate cannot be touched\u201d (\u00b68).  \n   \u2013 Detailed defense of intangibles.  \n   \u2013 Conclusion: \u201cYes\u2026 he did manage to beat the estate tax. The only problem is \u2026 death is pure loss\u201d (\u00b619).  \n   If \u201cthings\u201d meant physical property, there\u2019d be no \u201cbeating\u201d the tax, since those are taxed.  \n\n5. Relevance to question:  \n   \u2013 The question asks \u201cWhat \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued?\u201d Intangibles by definition lack market prices. Even love letters and books eventually have auction prices, but loyalty, reputation, guidance, reassurance, prudence are priceless, subjective, and personal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s emphasis, structure, and triumphant claim to have \u201cbeaten the estate tax\u201d can only be explained if the \u201cthings\u201d beyond valuation are the intangible values and virtues he transmitted\u2014precisely \u201cthe values that his children cherish,\u201d not mere family heirlooms or property.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. The question asks for \u201cthings the author says can\u2019t easily be valued.\u201d  \n   A. \u201cCan\u2019t easily be valued\u201d implies difficulty in assigning a dollar figure for estate\u2010tax purposes.  \n   B. Several passages emphasize tangible items that have \u201cno value \u2026 except to me,\u201d yet \u201can assessor will have to \u2026 appraise\u201d them (meaning the market value will understate their personal worth):  \n      \u2022 Clothing and furniture:  \n        <invalid_quote>\u201cnone of which has any value at all except to me \u2026 I can still smell his smell \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Love letters and poetry bound in ribbon:  \n        <invalid_quote>\u201clove letters \u2026 talking about their love \u2026 I suppose we\u2019ll have to place a value on these\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Personal mementos (White House cufflinks, photos, certificates):  \n        <quote>sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. Some</quote> (even here, they must be appraised)  \n      \u2022 Family heirlooms (books underlined since 1931):  \n        <quote> many of them still neatly underlined an</quote>  \n\n2. These items are \u201ctrivia\u201d compared to the \u201creally valuable estate,\u201d but they nonetheless illustrate the core issue:  \n   A. The personal value derived from these objects (smell of his clothes, the comfort of seeing his books) is inherently non\u2010quantifiable and therefore effectively \u201cbeats\u201d the estate tax\u2014no monetary appraisal can capture this sentimental worth.  \n   B. The author explicitly contrasts their \u201ctrivia\u201d status with the \u201creally valuable estate\u201d that \u201ccannot be touched by the death tax,\u201d showing that while assessors can tentatively assign a price, the true estate to the family is these tangible reminders.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cvalues his children cherish\u201d (intangible virtues: loyalty, prudence, reassurance, good name) are abstract and never described as needing appraisal for tax purposes.  \n   A. The text repeatedly states these intangibles \u201ccannot be taxed\u201d\u2014but the question is about \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued.\u201d  \n      \u2022 To \u201cvalue\u201d is to appraise, which presupposes an assessor and an item. Intangibles like \u201cloyalty\u201d and \u201cgood name\u201d lack any place in an inventory or appraisal process, hence they are not \u201cthings\u201d in the estate\u2010valuation context.  \n      \u2022 The author\u2019s rhetorical emphasis on virtues serves to highlight that the true value to heirs lies in sentimental items\u2014otherwise why dwell on the assessor\u2019s task?  \n   B. If intangibles were the \u201cthings\u201d in question, the author would not repeatedly note that assessors \u201cwill have to \u2026 appraise\u201d the books, letters, clothes, etc., and that the IRS will take \u201cabout 55 percent\u201d of his savings after valuing all assets.  \n\n4. Logical consistency and evidence:  \n   A. The author explicitly laments the estate tax on his \u201cdusty files\u201d and \u201cbank account numbers\u201d before turning to the \u201ctrivia\u201d items\u2014if intangibles were the answer, he would not waste space on appraisal details.  \n   B. He says \u201cthe only problem is that I miss him \u2026 I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone,\u201d referring to the sensory and emotional comfort from tangible objects during his life.  \n\n5. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued\u201d are the various personal properties\u2014books, love letters, furniture, clothes, mementos\u2014that hold sentimental, non\u2010market value to the family and thus \u201cbeat\u201d the estate tax, not the abstract virtues posited by Debater_A.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The values that his children cherish\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nMy Father's Estate \n\n         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: \"I saw that your father had died,\" she wrote. \"He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the things the author says can\u2019t easily be valued?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The values that his children cherish\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. The question asks for \u201cthings the author says can\u2019t easily be valued.\u201d  \n   A. \u201cCan\u2019t easily be valued\u201d implies difficulty in assigning a dollar figure for estate\u2010tax purposes.  \n   B. Several passages emphasize tangible items that have \u201cno value \u2026 except to me,\u201d yet \u201can assessor will have to \u2026 appraise\u201d them (meaning the market value will understate their personal worth):  \n      \u2022 Clothing and furniture:  \n        <invalid_quote>\u201cnone of which has any value at all except to me \u2026 I can still smell his smell \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Love letters and poetry bound in ribbon:  \n        <invalid_quote>\u201clove letters \u2026 talking about their love \u2026 I suppose we\u2019ll have to place a value on these\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Personal mementos (White House cufflinks, photos, certificates):  \n        <quote>sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. Some</quote> (even here, they must be appraised)  \n      \u2022 Family heirlooms (books underlined since 1931):  \n        <quote> many of them still neatly underlined an</quote>  \n\n2. These items are \u201ctrivia\u201d compared to the \u201creally valuable estate,\u201d but they nonetheless illustrate the core issue:  \n   A. The personal value derived from these objects (smell of his clothes, the comfort of seeing his books) is inherently non\u2010quantifiable and therefore effectively \u201cbeats\u201d the estate tax\u2014no monetary appraisal can capture this sentimental worth.  \n   B. The author explicitly contrasts their \u201ctrivia\u201d status with the \u201creally valuable estate\u201d that \u201ccannot be touched by the death tax,\u201d showing that while assessors can tentatively assign a price, the true estate to the family is these tangible reminders.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cvalues his children cherish\u201d (intangible virtues: loyalty, prudence, reassurance, good name) are abstract and never described as needing appraisal for tax purposes.  \n   A. The text repeatedly states these intangibles \u201ccannot be taxed\u201d\u2014but the question is about \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued.\u201d  \n      \u2022 To \u201cvalue\u201d is to appraise, which presupposes an assessor and an item. Intangibles like \u201cloyalty\u201d and \u201cgood name\u201d lack any place in an inventory or appraisal process, hence they are not \u201cthings\u201d in the estate\u2010valuation context.  \n      \u2022 The author\u2019s rhetorical emphasis on virtues serves to highlight that the true value to heirs lies in sentimental items\u2014otherwise why dwell on the assessor\u2019s task?  \n   B. If intangibles were the \u201cthings\u201d in question, the author would not repeatedly note that assessors \u201cwill have to \u2026 appraise\u201d the books, letters, clothes, etc., and that the IRS will take \u201cabout 55 percent\u201d of his savings after valuing all assets.  \n\n4. Logical consistency and evidence:  \n   A. The author explicitly laments the estate tax on his \u201cdusty files\u201d and \u201cbank account numbers\u201d before turning to the \u201ctrivia\u201d items\u2014if intangibles were the answer, he would not waste space on appraisal details.  \n   B. He says \u201cthe only problem is that I miss him \u2026 I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone,\u201d referring to the sensory and emotional comfort from tangible objects during his life.  \n\n5. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued\u201d are the various personal properties\u2014books, love letters, furniture, clothes, mementos\u2014that hold sentimental, non\u2010market value to the family and thus \u201cbeat\u201d the estate tax, not the abstract virtues posited by Debater_A.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued\u201d refer to the intangible values and legacies my father left, not merely physical property.  \n   a. Evidence: <quote> The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax.</quote> (\u00b68) and <invalid_quote>\u201ccannot be taxed \u2026 cannot be taken \u2026 cannot be passed on \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6\u00b69, 16, 17, 24). Only intangibles escape appraisal and taxation.  \n   b. Reasoning: The entire essay contrasts taxable bank accounts, furniture, letters, degrees (all appraised) with loyalty, gratitude, prudence, reassurance, devotion, and reputation\u2014all priceless and nonmarketable. The rhetorical thrust is that these intangibles are the true inheritance.  \n\n2. Claim: Material items \u201cmeaningful to the family\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position) are precisely what the IRS can and must value.  \n   a. Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cThere are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father\u2019s books\u2026 furniture\u2026 clothes\u2026 mementos\u2026 love letters\u2026 I suppose we\u2019ll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b67)  \n   b. Objection to Debater_B: By their own nature these items are appraised and taxed, so they do not \u201cbeat the estate tax.\u201d They are \u201cdusty files,\u201d \u201cbargain-basement furniture,\u201d \u201chardly a writer for the large audience\u201d (\u00b63,7). If Debater_B\u2019s answer were correct, there would be no rhetorical contrast of \u201cvaluable estate\u201d vs. IRS. The author\u2019s point hinges on intangibles escaping \u201cmarginal rate of 55 percent\u201d (\u00b63).  \n\n3. Claim: The repeated enumeration of intangible qualities underscores their centrality.  \n   a. Loyalty: Saved Ron Hoffman from dismissal (\u00b69). Extended tenure to support Nixon (\u00b610).  \n   b. Gratitude & Appreciation of America & Art: \u201cThis quality \u2026 cannot be taxed\u201d (\u00b611).  \n   c. Prudence & Reassurance: Advice about risk, fallback support, \u201cIRS taxes it at zero\u201d (\u00b613).  \n   d. Devotion & Reassurance to descendants: \u201cworth far more\u2026 cannot be taken\u2026 pass it on\u2026 without surcharge\u201d (\u00b616).  \n   e. Reputation & Good Name: \u201ccannot be taxed\u2026 priceless, incalculable in value\u201d (\u00b617).  \n\n4. Logical structure of essay:  \n   \u2013 Opening question: \u201cDid he figure out a way around the estate tax?\u201d (\u00b61)  \n   \u2013 Listing of all things taxed.  \n   \u2013 Declaration: \u201cthe really valuable estate cannot be touched\u201d (\u00b68).  \n   \u2013 Detailed defense of intangibles.  \n   \u2013 Conclusion: \u201cYes\u2026 he did manage to beat the estate tax. The only problem is \u2026 death is pure loss\u201d (\u00b619).  \n   If \u201cthings\u201d meant physical property, there\u2019d be no \u201cbeating\u201d the tax, since those are taxed.  \n\n5. Relevance to question:  \n   \u2013 The question asks \u201cWhat \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued?\u201d Intangibles by definition lack market prices. Even love letters and books eventually have auction prices, but loyalty, reputation, guidance, reassurance, prudence are priceless, subjective, and personal.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s emphasis, structure, and triumphant claim to have \u201cbeaten the estate tax\u201d can only be explained if the \u201cthings\u201d beyond valuation are the intangible values and virtues he transmitted\u2014precisely \u201cthe values that his children cherish,\u201d not mere family heirlooms or property.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Reaffirming Definition of \u201cCan\u2019t Easily Be Valued\u201d  \n   a. The question hinges on \u201cbeating the estate tax\u201d (<quote> Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\"</quote> \u00b61). Only assets that cannot be appraised or taxed can \u201cbeat\u201d it. By Debater_B\u2019s logic, if \u201ctrivial\u201d sentimental items were the answer, they would be taxed:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201can assessor will have to come in to appraise \u2026 I suppose we\u2019ll have to place a value on these and have them taxed\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b67, my emphasis).  \n      \u2022 Yet the conclusion: <quote> The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax.</quote> (\u00b68). \u201cReally valuable\u201d thus refers to what \u201ccannot be appraised.\u201d  \n   b. Intangibles\u2014loyalty, prudence, reputation\u2014are repeatedly marked \u201ccannot be taxed\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccannot be taxed\u2026cannot be taken\u2026pass it on\u2026without surcharge\u201d</invalid_quote> \u00b6\u00b69, 11, 13, 16, 17). They are the only items that \u201cbeat\u201d the 55% rate.  \n\n2. Debater_B Misreads \u201cCan\u2019t Easily Be Valued\u201d  \n   a. \u201cValued\u201d in estate\u2010tax context requires market price and assessor. The text explicitly describes tangible items as being appraised and taxed. Sentiment does not alter that process.  \n   b. Personal \u201cworth\u201d of these items (<quote> none of which has any value at all except to me </quote> \u00b67) is precisely why they *must* be assigned a conservative market value by law. Their \u201csentimental\u201d worth is irrelevant to the IRS but crucial to the author\u2019s contrast. If the true inheritance were these taxed items, he would not celebrate \u201cbeating\u201d the tax.  \n   c. The author laments the tax on bank accounts and \u201cdusty files\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cpawing through old, dusty files\u2026so maybe it\u2019s a good time to think\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> \u00b62), not praising their personal comfort. He already had comfort from intangibles *before* death (<quote> I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone,</quote> \u00b619).  \n\n3. Centrality of Intangible Legacies  \n   a. Loyalty & Principle: Rescuing Hoffman, unwavering service to Nixon (<quote> My father would never turn his back o</quote> \u00b610).  \n   b. Gratitude & Worldview: Appreciation of America\u2019s progress, art, nature (<invalid_quote>\u201cThis quality\u2026cannot be taxed\u201d</invalid_quote> \u00b611).  \n   c. Prudence & Reassurance: Lifeline support, risk perspective, advice (<quote> IRS taxes it at zero.</quote> \u00b613).  \n   d. Devotion & Good Name: Sustained personal attachments, \u201cpriceless, incalculable in value\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b617</invalid_quote>).  \n   e. Transmission: \u201cPass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge\u201d (\u00b616).  \n   The essay\u2019s structure (list taxed items \u2192 declare untaxed assets as \u201creally valuable\u201d \u2192 enumerate intangibles \u2192 conclude \u201cbeating\u201d the tax) demonstrates that the \u201cthings\u2026can\u2019t easily be valued\u201d are these intangible values.  \n\n4. Logical Necessity & Rhetorical Emphasis  \n   a. The rhetorical flourish \u201cbeat the estate tax\u201d is only sustainable if most \u201cestate\u201d escapes valuation. Tangibles under Debater_B\u2019s view are *subject* to taxation.  \n   b. Final lament (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe only problem is\u2026death part is pure loss\u201d</invalid_quote> \u00b619) underscores that only in death are *even* intangibles partially lost; while alive, the author enjoyed them unappraised. This enjoyment is the \u201cvaluable estate\u201d he already had.  \n\n5. Burden of Proof on Tangibles Theory  \n   a. Debater_B must explain why the author would painstakingly tally all taxable assets and lament the 55% levy if his answer were simply \u201cthe sentimental value of those taxed items.\u201d  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s reading collapses the central drama: sacrifice of thrift to save these \u201ctrivia\u201d rather than passing a legacy of virtue and guidance. The author\u2019s repeated advice (\u201cLet\u2019s rake together,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d \u201ckeep on prudence\u201d) shows investment in intangibles, not accumulation of heirlooms.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Only intangible virtues\u2014loyalty, prudence, gratitude, reputation, reassurance\u2014meet the dual criteria: (1) they elude market appraisal and taxation and (2) the author defines them as the \u201creally valuable estate\u201d that he \u201cbeat\u201d the death tax on. Therefore, \u201cthe values that his children cherish\u201d is the correct answer; Debater_B\u2019s tangibles are precisely what the IRS can\u2014and does\u2014value.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Definition and Context of \u201cThings \u2026 Can\u2019t Easily Be Valued\u201d  \n   A. The essay\u2019s repeated reference to \u201cappraising\u201d and \u201ctaxing\u201d presupposes items with nominal market value, yet whose true sentimental worth \u201cno assessor\u201d can capture.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThere are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise \u2026 I suppose we\u2019ll have to place a value on these \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b67).  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I think about it, I want to cry \u2026 after paying estate expenses \u2026 taxed at about 55 percent \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b63).  \n   B. The question\u2014\u201cDid he figure out a way around the estate tax?\u201d\u2014and the conclusion\u2014\u201che did manage to beat the estate tax\u201d (\u00b619)\u2014only make sense if the \u201cthings\u201d escaping valuation are among those assessed but intrinsically undervalued by any market price.\n\n2. Evidence of Tangible Items\u2019 Non-Quantifiable Worth  \n   A. Clothing and Furniture:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cnone of which has any value at all except to me \u2026 I can still smell his smell \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b67). Smell and emotional memory cannot be reflected in auction prices.  \n   B. Books and Papers:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cbooks \u2026 neatly underlined and annotated \u2026 days before his death\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b67). Collector value ignores the personal annotations spanning 70 years.  \n   C. Love Letters, Mementos, Cufflinks, Photographs:  \n      \u2022 <quote>of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too.</quote> (\u00b67). Their \u201cvalue\u201d for family is meaning, not resale.  \n   D. These \u201ctrivia\u201d items are contrasted to \u201cthe really valuable estate\u201d that \u201ccannot be touched\u201d (\u00b68), implying that only personal property can straddle both sides\u2014subject to appraisal yet in fact priceless to heirs.\n\n3. Why Intangibles Alone Cannot Explain \u201cBeat the Tax\u201d  \n   A. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cloyalty,\u201d \u201cprudence,\u201d \u201cgratitude,\u201d \u201cgood name\u201d are never listed among appraisable assets; they are never part of an \u201cinventory\u201d or \u201cassessor\u2019s\u201d tasks. They are consequences of having tangible \u201creminders\u201d of Pop around, as the author notes he \u201calready had the best parts \u2026 without his being gone\u201d (\u00b619).  \n   B. If only intangibles mattered, there would be no need to \u201cpaw through old, dusty files\u201d for \u201cbank account numbers\u201d or to \u201cappraise\u201d love letters\u2014yet the author grieves the tax on these accounts and objects (\u00b62\u20133). The deep emotional reliance on tangible items during life, and the desire for them after death, shows their centrality.  \n   C. Debater_A concedes these items *are* appraised and taxed (\u00b67), which proves market valuation fails to capture their true worth. The author\u2019s victory\u2014having hedged against the tax\u2014comes from sentimental attachment, not legal avoidance of appraisal.\n\n4. Logical Consistency with Author\u2019s Structure and Conclusion  \n   A. Sequence: Taxable assets \u2192 \u201ctrivia\u201d items requiring appraisal \u2192 Declaration of true estate \u2192 Intangibles as derived *from* tangibles \u2192 Conclusion that \u201cdeath \u2026 is pure loss\u201d despite sentimental assets already enjoyed (\u00b619).  \n   B. The very lamentation that \u201cafter paying estate expenses \u2026 taxed at about 55 percent \u2026 I want to cry\u201d (\u00b63) underscores reliance on sentimental property to \u201cbeat\u201d the high marginal rate. Without these personal objects (books, clothes, letters), the children would be left only with heavily taxed cash.\n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A  \n   A. Misreads \u201cthings \u2026 can\u2019t easily be valued\u201d as pure abstractions. But the phrase \u201ccan\u2019t easily be valued\u201d implies *difficulty* in assigning a dollar figure, not *impossibility* of conceptualizing. Books with unique annotations and wives\u2019 love letters literally defy standard market metrics.  \n   B. Intangibles are *effects* of tangible reminders. The reassurance, prudence, devotion, and reputation \u201cpassed on\u201d are internalized via interaction with Pop\u2019s property and writings (\u00b613,16). Without those objects, intangibles lack transmission vectors.  \n   C. Debater_A ignores repeated, explicit references to \u201cappraising\u201d and \u201cplacing a value\u201d on the \u201cfew material, tangible items\u201d (\u00b67). These lines exist *only* to highlight the chasm between market price and personal worth.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s true \u201cestate\u201d that \u201cbeats the estate tax\u201d consists of personal property\u2014books, letters, furniture, clothes, mementos\u2014whose sentimental value \u201cno assessor\u201d can quantify. This reading aligns with the essay\u2019s structure, explicit appraisal language, and the children\u2019s intense emotional attachment, whereas Debater_A\u2019s purely intangible answer fails to explain the essay\u2019s focus on appraisal procedures and the question of \u201cfiguring out a way around the estate tax.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
