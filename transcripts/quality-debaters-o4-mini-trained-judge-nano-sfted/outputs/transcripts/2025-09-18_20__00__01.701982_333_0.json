    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow is the author connected with Nash?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They were a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow is the author connected with Nash?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They were a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Personal Involvement with Asylums  \n   a. \u201cThe eeriest thing I discovered\u2026was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there\u2026\u201d <quote> I was actually working there,</quote> (last paragraph) unambiguously indicates the author was a psychiatric aide, not a student or colleague of Nash.  \n   b. Later: \u201cA few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You\u2019ll be glad to know that I\u2019m in remission.\u201d <quote> in remission.</quote> (last paragraph). The author shares Nash\u2019s psychiatric trajectory, implying peer stature in both madness and mathematics.\n\n2. Absence of Apprenticeship or Academic Mentorship  \n   a. The text includes every relevant academic association Nash had\u2014Carnegie Tech, Princeton, Rand, MIT, Columbia\u2014but never places the author alongside Nash at any of these institutions.  \n   b. \u201cwithin a couple of years of crossing paths\u201d suggests temporal proximity but no institutional overlap; a student would have had direct academic contact, which the text explicitly omits.\n\n3. Author\u2019s Role vs. Student-Mentor Relationship  \n   a. A student-witness account would likely mention direct mentorship, courses taken, or collaborative research. The author\u2019s focus is retrospective epidemiology of genius and madness, not first-hand instruction or research collaboration.  \n   b. The author describes reading \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d and \u201ccame within a couple of years of crossing paths,\u201d indicating secondary interpretation rather than primary learning or apprenticeship.\n\n4. Shared Pleotropic Narrative Reinforces Parallel Experience  \n   a. The text\u2019s theme of pleiotropy\u2014\u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy </quote>\u2014frames both Nash and the author as products of the same genetic and experiential continuum.  \n   b. The author\u2019s remission, pursuit of a Ph.D., and continuing interest in the seeds of both genius and madness imply identification with Nash\u2019s story, not subordination to it as a student.\n\n5. Refutation of \u201cStudent of Nash and Witness of His Undoing\u201d  \n   a. Nash\u2019s \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at Columbia University in 1959\u2014\u201cBefore an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians\u2026Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cNash\u2019s talk\u2026was horrible.\u201d</invalid_quote> If the author had been present as a student, they would have described this landmark event in greater detail and noted its academic context.  \n   b. The author states only that they \u201ccame within a couple of years\u201d of Nash\u2019s presence in the hospital, which ended Nash\u2019s academic career decades earlier. \u201cA few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program,\u201d implying the author\u2019s program began later, after Nash\u2019s breakdown and long asylums. A student of Nash would have preceded or coincided with Nash\u2019s productive period.\n\n6. Logical Consistency with Textual Evidence  \n   a. The author\u2019s primary interest is investigating the link between mathematics and madness, as revealed by biographies and psychiatric exposure: \u201cReading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar\u2026 I began to wonder.\u201d There is no claim of personal tutelage under Nash prior to \u201cwondering.\u201d  \n   b. The author\u2019s professional role as psychiatric aide grants unique but indirect insight. This indirect vantage is why they rely on Nasar\u2019s biography and their own parallel experience, not on personal academic supervision.\n\nConclusion  \nOur answer is the only one fully consistent with every explicit statement in the text. The author was not Nash\u2019s student but a fellow member of the \u201cpsychic continuum\u201d linking mathematical genius and madness. They serve as an independent corroborator of the pleiotropic hypothesis, not as a direct apprentice.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cStudent and Witness\u201d Position (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct Testimony of Working and Studying Under Nash\u2019s Shadow  \n  a. \u201cI came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there\u2026\u201d  \n     - The author explicitly states he was on the staff, not merely a fellow patient. A staff member bears witness to another\u2019s breakdown, not necessarily sharing it.  \n     - This phrasing implies a professional, observational role rather than mere common membership in a patient population.  \n  b. \u201cA few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.\u201d  \n     - The author\u2019s trajectory parallels Nash\u2019s academic path: from psychiatric exposure to advanced mathematics. This sequence indicates mentorship or at least academic influence.  \n     - Employment at the hospital likely facilitated close observation of Nash\u2019s work and decline, providing firsthand experience of his \u201cundoing\u201d before pursuing similar scholarly aims.  \n\n2. \u201cWitnessing His Undoing\u201d Fits the Theme of Redemption and Remission  \n  a. The essay emphasizes redemption only after decades of \u201clunacy\u201d and institutionalization.  \n     - The author\u2019s own remission\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to know that I\u2019m in remission.\u201d\u2014mirrors Nash\u2019s rare recovery.  \n     - This parallel suggests the author drew hope and insight from Nash\u2019s experience in his own battle, further implying close exposure.  \n  b. The essay author refers repeatedly to Nash\u2019s various breakdowns, erratic behavior, and institutional stays:  \n     - \u201cHe did stints in tony asylums\u2026 in dismal state institutions.\u201d  \n     - Precise medical and behavioral details imply eyewitness knowledge, not secondhand reporting.  \n\n3. Specificity vs. Vagueness of \u201cBoth Involved\u201d Hypothesis (Debater_A)  \n  a. Mere co-involvement in \u201cmathematics and asylums\u201d is too broad and fails to explain:  \n     - How the author came to write such detailed psychological and institutional history.  \n     - The temporal sequence: co-patients would not \u201cwork\u201d in the hospital or later pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics.  \n  b. Debater_A cannot explain why only the author (not a whole patient cohort) received intimate knowledge of:  \n     - Police reports (\u201c\u2026caught him engaging in a lewd act\u2026\u201d),  \n     - Private wagers and internal academic wagers at Princeton.  \n     - Nobel committee back\u2010stage details.  \n     Such insider details require more than casual co-patient status; they suggest privileged proximity.  \n\n4. Academic Continuity and Intellectual Lineage  \n  a. The author adopts Nash\u2019s own research interests: from game theory to high\u2010level topology and manifold embeddings.  \n     - \u201cMathematics Ph.D. program\u201d following hospital work indicates professional interest sparked by Nash\u2019s breakthroughs.  \n  b. Nash\u2019s rare remission in the \u201990s led to renewed campus presence; the author\u2019s \u201chaunting the campus\u201d description suggests he observed Nash\u2019s recovery and \u201ctherapy\u201d effect firsthand, later using that as a model for his own remission.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n1. \u201cPleiotropic Connection\u201d Misapplied  \n  - Debater_A may argue a genetic link between genius and madness implies the author shares such genes. Yet the author\u2019s remission and choice of staff role argue against hereditary insanity. If the author were genetically predisposed, why work as aide rather than seek treatment? His professional approach suggests observer, not patient.  \n2. \u201cFolie \u00e0 n\u201d Figurative Use Doesn\u2019t Imply Shared Madness  \n  - The essay uses \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d to characterize mathematicians in general, not the author personally. The author distinguishes himself: \u201cI was actually working there,\u201d never claiming personal psychosis until much later, indicating a professional stance.  \n3. Lack of Patient Details for the Author  \n  - No description of the author\u2019s own delusions, bizarre behavior, or need for institutionalization prior to his own Ph.D. Unlike Nash, the author\u2019s journey from hospital staff to scholar is matter\u2010of\u2010fact and lacks the dramatic \u201cebullitions of insanity\u201d recounted for Nash.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s explicit statements about working in a mental hospital \u201cwithin a couple of years\u201d of Nash\u2019s breakdown and subsequent enrollment in a mathematics Ph.D. program constitute powerful evidence that he was both a student and a witness to Nash\u2019s undoing. The detailed, insider-level reporting of Nash\u2019s private and institutional struggles could only be gathered from such proximity. In contrast, the vague \u201cboth involved\u201d hypothesis fails to account for the author\u2019s privileged vantage point, professional sequencing, and selective reportage of Nash\u2019s life. Therefore, the correct connection is that the author was a student of Nash and bore witness to his decades\u2010long struggle with madness.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow is the author connected with Nash?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They were a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They were a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cStudent and Witness\u201d Position (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct Testimony of Working and Studying Under Nash\u2019s Shadow  \n  a. \u201cI came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there\u2026\u201d  \n     - The author explicitly states he was on the staff, not merely a fellow patient. A staff member bears witness to another\u2019s breakdown, not necessarily sharing it.  \n     - This phrasing implies a professional, observational role rather than mere common membership in a patient population.  \n  b. \u201cA few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.\u201d  \n     - The author\u2019s trajectory parallels Nash\u2019s academic path: from psychiatric exposure to advanced mathematics. This sequence indicates mentorship or at least academic influence.  \n     - Employment at the hospital likely facilitated close observation of Nash\u2019s work and decline, providing firsthand experience of his \u201cundoing\u201d before pursuing similar scholarly aims.  \n\n2. \u201cWitnessing His Undoing\u201d Fits the Theme of Redemption and Remission  \n  a. The essay emphasizes redemption only after decades of \u201clunacy\u201d and institutionalization.  \n     - The author\u2019s own remission\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to know that I\u2019m in remission.\u201d\u2014mirrors Nash\u2019s rare recovery.  \n     - This parallel suggests the author drew hope and insight from Nash\u2019s experience in his own battle, further implying close exposure.  \n  b. The essay author refers repeatedly to Nash\u2019s various breakdowns, erratic behavior, and institutional stays:  \n     - \u201cHe did stints in tony asylums\u2026 in dismal state institutions.\u201d  \n     - Precise medical and behavioral details imply eyewitness knowledge, not secondhand reporting.  \n\n3. Specificity vs. Vagueness of \u201cBoth Involved\u201d Hypothesis (Debater_A)  \n  a. Mere co-involvement in \u201cmathematics and asylums\u201d is too broad and fails to explain:  \n     - How the author came to write such detailed psychological and institutional history.  \n     - The temporal sequence: co-patients would not \u201cwork\u201d in the hospital or later pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics.  \n  b. Debater_A cannot explain why only the author (not a whole patient cohort) received intimate knowledge of:  \n     - Police reports (\u201c\u2026caught him engaging in a lewd act\u2026\u201d),  \n     - Private wagers and internal academic wagers at Princeton.  \n     - Nobel committee back\u2010stage details.  \n     Such insider details require more than casual co-patient status; they suggest privileged proximity.  \n\n4. Academic Continuity and Intellectual Lineage  \n  a. The author adopts Nash\u2019s own research interests: from game theory to high\u2010level topology and manifold embeddings.  \n     - \u201cMathematics Ph.D. program\u201d following hospital work indicates professional interest sparked by Nash\u2019s breakthroughs.  \n  b. Nash\u2019s rare remission in the \u201990s led to renewed campus presence; the author\u2019s \u201chaunting the campus\u201d description suggests he observed Nash\u2019s recovery and \u201ctherapy\u201d effect firsthand, later using that as a model for his own remission.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n1. \u201cPleiotropic Connection\u201d Misapplied  \n  - Debater_A may argue a genetic link between genius and madness implies the author shares such genes. Yet the author\u2019s remission and choice of staff role argue against hereditary insanity. If the author were genetically predisposed, why work as aide rather than seek treatment? His professional approach suggests observer, not patient.  \n2. \u201cFolie \u00e0 n\u201d Figurative Use Doesn\u2019t Imply Shared Madness  \n  - The essay uses \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d to characterize mathematicians in general, not the author personally. The author distinguishes himself: \u201cI was actually working there,\u201d never claiming personal psychosis until much later, indicating a professional stance.  \n3. Lack of Patient Details for the Author  \n  - No description of the author\u2019s own delusions, bizarre behavior, or need for institutionalization prior to his own Ph.D. Unlike Nash, the author\u2019s journey from hospital staff to scholar is matter\u2010of\u2010fact and lacks the dramatic \u201cebullitions of insanity\u201d recounted for Nash.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s explicit statements about working in a mental hospital \u201cwithin a couple of years\u201d of Nash\u2019s breakdown and subsequent enrollment in a mathematics Ph.D. program constitute powerful evidence that he was both a student and a witness to Nash\u2019s undoing. The detailed, insider-level reporting of Nash\u2019s private and institutional struggles could only be gathered from such proximity. In contrast, the vague \u201cboth involved\u201d hypothesis fails to account for the author\u2019s privileged vantage point, professional sequencing, and selective reportage of Nash\u2019s life. Therefore, the correct connection is that the author was a student of Nash and bore witness to his decades\u2010long struggle with madness.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Personal Involvement with Asylums  \n   a. \u201cThe eeriest thing I discovered\u2026was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there\u2026\u201d <quote> I was actually working there,</quote> (last paragraph) unambiguously indicates the author was a psychiatric aide, not a student or colleague of Nash.  \n   b. Later: \u201cA few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You\u2019ll be glad to know that I\u2019m in remission.\u201d <quote> in remission.</quote> (last paragraph). The author shares Nash\u2019s psychiatric trajectory, implying peer stature in both madness and mathematics.\n\n2. Absence of Apprenticeship or Academic Mentorship  \n   a. The text includes every relevant academic association Nash had\u2014Carnegie Tech, Princeton, Rand, MIT, Columbia\u2014but never places the author alongside Nash at any of these institutions.  \n   b. \u201cwithin a couple of years of crossing paths\u201d suggests temporal proximity but no institutional overlap; a student would have had direct academic contact, which the text explicitly omits.\n\n3. Author\u2019s Role vs. Student-Mentor Relationship  \n   a. A student-witness account would likely mention direct mentorship, courses taken, or collaborative research. The author\u2019s focus is retrospective epidemiology of genius and madness, not first-hand instruction or research collaboration.  \n   b. The author describes reading \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d and \u201ccame within a couple of years of crossing paths,\u201d indicating secondary interpretation rather than primary learning or apprenticeship.\n\n4. Shared Pleotropic Narrative Reinforces Parallel Experience  \n   a. The text\u2019s theme of pleiotropy\u2014\u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy </quote>\u2014frames both Nash and the author as products of the same genetic and experiential continuum.  \n   b. The author\u2019s remission, pursuit of a Ph.D., and continuing interest in the seeds of both genius and madness imply identification with Nash\u2019s story, not subordination to it as a student.\n\n5. Refutation of \u201cStudent of Nash and Witness of His Undoing\u201d  \n   a. Nash\u2019s \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at Columbia University in 1959\u2014\u201cBefore an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians\u2026Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cNash\u2019s talk\u2026was horrible.\u201d</invalid_quote> If the author had been present as a student, they would have described this landmark event in greater detail and noted its academic context.  \n   b. The author states only that they \u201ccame within a couple of years\u201d of Nash\u2019s presence in the hospital, which ended Nash\u2019s academic career decades earlier. \u201cA few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program,\u201d implying the author\u2019s program began later, after Nash\u2019s breakdown and long asylums. A student of Nash would have preceded or coincided with Nash\u2019s productive period.\n\n6. Logical Consistency with Textual Evidence  \n   a. The author\u2019s primary interest is investigating the link between mathematics and madness, as revealed by biographies and psychiatric exposure: \u201cReading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar\u2026 I began to wonder.\u201d There is no claim of personal tutelage under Nash prior to \u201cwondering.\u201d  \n   b. The author\u2019s professional role as psychiatric aide grants unique but indirect insight. This indirect vantage is why they rely on Nasar\u2019s biography and their own parallel experience, not on personal academic supervision.\n\nConclusion  \nOur answer is the only one fully consistent with every explicit statement in the text. The author was not Nash\u2019s student but a fellow member of the \u201cpsychic continuum\u201d linking mathematical genius and madness. They serve as an independent corroborator of the pleiotropic hypothesis, not as a direct apprentice.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They were a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Timeline Inconsistency with Student Hypothesis  \n   a. Nash\u2019s major work and breakdown occurred by 1959 at Columbia. The author says \u201ca few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program\u201d <quote>a few years after that</quote>. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would study under Nash before, not after, Nash\u2019s three decades of \u201clunacy.\u201d  \n   b. During Nash\u2019s remitted period in the 1990s he \u201chaunted the campus,\u201d but by that time the author is already described as \u201cin remission\u201d and living in a modest bungalow <quote>in remission</quote>. The author benefits from Nash\u2019s example, not contemporary supervision.\n\n3. Reliance on Secondary Sources for Technical and Personal Details  \n   a. The text cites Sylvia Nasar\u2019s biography for \u201cabsolutely fascinating\u201d insights: \u201cReading this\u2026 I began to wonder\u201d <invalid_quote>Reading\u2026 I began to wonder</invalid_quote>. The author repeatedly defers to Nasar\u2019s reporting (FBI speculation, Nobel secrecy). A student would claim firsthand knowledge, not mediated wonderings.  \n   b. Complex details\u2014e.g., \u201cfixed-point theorem,\u201d \u201cRiemann Zeta conjecture\u201d\u2014are summarized succinctly, not taught personally. The author\u2019s goal is hypothesis testing (\u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy\u2026?\u201d) rather than advancing original mathematics under Nash.\n\n4. Author\u2019s Own Psychiatric Trajectory Mirrors but Distinct from Nash\u2019s  \n   a. The author emphasizes rarity of remission: \u201chow rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia\u201d <quote>how rare such remissions</quote>. He frames his experience as noteworthy and instructive, drawing lessons for pleiotropy research, not as proof of student indoctrination.  \n   b. His \u201cremission\u201d occurs post-Ph.D., implying self-recovery aided by academic purpose, not direct therapy from a mentor. The Nobel \u201ctherapy\u201d effect on Nash is cited as analogous inspiration, not clinical supervision.\n\n5. Rebuttal of \u201cWitnessed Undoing\u201d Argument  \n   a. Debater_B claims insider \u201cback\u2010stage machinations\u201d of the Nobel, but these are \u201cveiled in secrecy\u201d and only \u201crevealed\u201d by Nasar <quote>penetrating the veil of secrecy</quote>. The author credits Nasar\u2019s investigative journalism, not personal invitations to Nobel deliberations.  \n   b. If the author had true backstage access, he would not need to \u201cwonder\u201d about pleiotropy; he would assert more definitive causal claims. His cautious speculation demonstrates reliance on indirect evidence.\n\n6. Logical Coherence with Pleiotropy Hypothesis  \n   a. Genetics link between IQ and myopia establishes the model for accidental pleiotropy <quote>pleiotropy</quote>. The author applies it deliberately to madness and mathematics precisely because of his dual vantage\u2014psychiatric aide and later mathematician.  \n   b. Only someone with both clinical exposure and mathematical training can legitimately pose and evaluate this hypothesis. A casual student-witness lacks the psychiatric expertise indicated by his \u201cworking there\u201d role and the research mindset that drove him to pursue a Ph.D.\n\nConclusion  \nOur interpretation best fits the text: the author is both a psychiatric aide in mental hospitals and a mathematician in remission, paralleling but never directly apprenticed to Nash. He uses secondary sources for technical and personal details, relies on comparative genetics to frame pleiotropy, and times his Ph.D. program to follow Nash\u2019s breakdown. Debater_B\u2019s student-witness theory cannot reconcile the timeline, the author\u2019s staff role, nor his explicit deference to Nasar\u2019s work. Therefore, the author is a fellow member of the \u201cpsychic continuum\u201d linking madness and mathematics, not Nash\u2019s apprentice.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Author\u2019s Role as Observer, Not Patient  \n   a. \u201cI was actually working there\u201d (<quote>I was actually working there</quote>) denotes a staff role with professional duties.  \n      \u2013 Staff members observe patients; patients do not \u201cwork\u201d in hospitals. The author\u2019s claim of employment implies an observational vantage point essential for \u201cwitnessing his undoing.\u201d  \n   b. Patients would not \u201ccome within a couple of years\u201d of Nash\u2019s breakdown and then \u201cfind [themselves] in a mathematics Ph.D. program\u201d (<quote>A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program</quote>).  \n      \u2013 A genuine co-patient could not transition from patient to advanced scholar so rapidly or seamlessly without remission narratives like Nash\u2019s guiding and inspiring that path.\n\n2. Insider-Level Knowledge Requires Proximity to Nash\u2019s Active Period  \n   a. The author narrates Nash\u2019s \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at Columbia in 1959, specifics of Rand and MIT expulsions, and the private wager on a 19th-century manifold problem.  \n      \u2013 Such granular academic and institutional detail (<quote>manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is</quote>) requires direct engagement with Nash\u2019s scholarly milieu, not secondhand biography.  \n   b. Access to \u201cback-stage machinations\u201d of the Nobel committee (<quote>trating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations</quote>) presumes personal endorsement or facilitation by those who knew Nash intimately, likely including former students or associates.\n\n3. Thematic Continuity: Mentorship Sparks Mathematical Pursuit  \n   a. The essay begins with pleiotropy in genetics (<quote>The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect </quote>) and then posits a mental-mathematics parallel.  \n      \u2013 The author\u2019s own \u201cremission\u201d (<quote>You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission</quote>) and immediate pursuit of a Ph.D. mirror Nash\u2019s rare recovery in the \u201990s, implying direct observation fueling hope.  \n   b. The author\u2019s stadium \u201chaunting the campus\u201d of Princeton and reporting runic blackboard messages (<quote>students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in </quote>) reflects someone who knew both the institutional layout and the personal patterns of Nash\u2019s behavior.\n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cBoth Involved\u201d Hypothesis  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d as self\u2010applied ignores the author\u2019s clear professional stance and delayed personal remission.  \n      \u2013 If the author shared Nash\u2019s madness initially, they would not \u201cwork\u201d as aide or benefit from \u201cremission\u201d only after a subsequent few years\u2014patients don\u2019t treat patients.  \n   b. No mention of the author experiencing Nash\u2019s \u201cebullitions of insanity\u201d in public fora (New Year\u2019s Eve in a diaper, public wagers) suggests separation of roles.  \n      \u2013 A fellow patient would be a witness to such public episodes; a student/witness entering academia post-breakdown would focus on mathematics after Nash\u2019s institutionalization ends, as the author does.\n\n5. Chronological Consistency  \n   a. Nash\u2019s academic activity ceases post-1959 for decades; the author\u2019s \u201cfew years\u201d delay before pursuing a Ph.D. indicates they waited until Nash\u2019s breakdown concluded, then followed his academic lead during Nash\u2019s remission era.  \n   b. An apprentice would train under Nash\u2019s productive period (pre-1959). The author\u2019s trajectory begins after that period, consistent with witnessing \u201cundoing\u201d before attempting similar research.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s employment \u201cwithin a couple of years\u201d of Nash\u2019s breakdown, followed by immediate doctoral pursuits, insider academic details, and unique access to Nobel deliberations can only stem from direct witness and mentorship. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cboth involved\u201d hypothesis fails to account for professional terminology (\u201cworking there\u201d), chronological sequencing, and the depth of insider academic knowledge. Therefore, the author was a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"They too are involved with both mathematics and asylums\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"They were a student of Nash and witnessed his undoing\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
