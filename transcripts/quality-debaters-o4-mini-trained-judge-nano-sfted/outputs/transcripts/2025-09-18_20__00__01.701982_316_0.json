    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Training over Selection  (\u201cNurture,\u201d not \u201cNature\u201d)\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Dramatic Improvement  \n  a. <quote> Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. </quote>  \n     \u2013 Prior to this program, China had negligible presence in women\u2019s distance events (no medals or record-setting performances). A single generation of concerted training and selection by national sports authorities produced world-class athletes.  \n     \u2013 Such rapid improvement is inconsistent with pure genetic selection, which requires many generations to shift allele frequencies significantly.  \n\n2. Environmental Control Eliminates Genetic Explanation  \n  a. If \u201crace\u201d (genes) were the determinant, Chinese athletes would have excelled long before the expensive, systematic training program of the late 1980s\u2013early 1990s.  \n  b. The timing (post-training) of the surge in performance demonstrates the causal role of sports science, coaching, and infrastructure:  \n     \u2013 Sports technology and nutrition (\u201ctinkering,\u201d yes, but essential when applied at scale).  \n     \u2013 Talent identification, centralized coaching, systematic monitoring of lactic acid, etc.  \n\n3. Analogy to Ubiquity of Improvement via Demographics and Nurture  \n  a. The author repeatedly credits <quote> demographic patterns </quote> and <quote>\"secular\" trends.</quote> (diet, health care, literacy) for long-term performance gains.  \n  b. China\u2019s rise is an accelerated microcosm of these secular trends applied intentionally to sport, not a natural product of genetic endowment.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLarge Population + Selection\u201d Thesis  \n  a. Purely passive selection among 1+ billion people without systematic training has never yielded rapid Olympic success (cf. horse racing requiring intentional breeding).  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cRace horses \u2026for years \u2026 simply stopped getting faster\u2026 Generations of careful genetic selection \u2026 but you can go only so far.\u201d </invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Race horses are **intensively** bred with known heritable traits; humans without managed breeding show no comparable natural progress.  \n  b. If mere population size were sufficient, China\u2014population in hundreds of millions long before the 1990s\u2014would have produced medalists earlier. It did not.  \n  c. Genetic differences cannot be isolated (author: <invalid_quote>\u201cYou cannot control \u2026 environmental differences \u2026 Cannot conclude Africans have better genes.\u201d</invalid_quote>), so Debater_B\u2019s selection argument rests on untestable assumptions.  \n\n5. Rapid, Reversible Gains Confirm Environmental Causation  \n  a. Olympic performance of nations often rises and falls with investment: the USSR, East Germany, and China all surged with state programs; after program cuts, performance regresses.  \n  b. Genetic gains via \u201chybrid vigor\u201d would not reverse in a few decades. China\u2019s performance spike aligns too closely with policy, not with migration or admixture rates.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The Chinese example epitomizes the power of training, nutrition, and healthcare advances (\u201cnurture\u201d) to overcome any putative racial or genetic limitations. Their ascent from zero to fourth place in one Olympic cycle, in women\u2019s distance events, conclusively \u201cdispel[led] the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My claim: China\u2019s success \u201cdispels\u201d racial determinism by leveraging its vast population to unearth elite runners through extensive selection, not by novel training per se.  \n\n   a. Background: The article emphasizes that athletic records largely reflect demographic factors (\u201cpool size\u201d), not just training or technology. It states that \u201cYou are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000.\u201d (<invalid_quote>several million\u202610,000</invalid_quote>). China\u2019s billion-plus population multiplies the chance of exceptional talent.  \n\n   b. Chinese \u201cexperiment\u201d: The text notes \u201cThe Chinese sports establishment\u2026produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026and\u2026ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul\u201d (<invalid_quote>China\u2026record-breaking\u2026fourth</invalid_quote>). This success requires identifying and selecting individuals with superior innate capacity before training refines them. Mere training on a small pool cannot generate world-class stars.  \n\n   c. Consistency with other examples: Africa\u2019s pre-school running habits produce champions because necessity exposes a massive cohort to endurance (\u201chabit of running immense distances\u2026primary school\u201d <quote>immense distances</quote>). It is the combination of environment + numbers that matters.  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201ctraining breakthrough\u201d theory:  \n\n   a. Training is \u201ctinkering\u201d: The author dismisses incremental advances (\u201cnew Nike shoe\u2026lactic-acid programs\u2026nutritionists\u201d) as incapable of explaining long-term secular trends in records (<quote>little more than tinkering</quote>). A sudden leap to fourth place worldwide requires more than minor training tweaks.  \n\n   b. Temporal scope: The Chinese surge occurred within one generation. The article argues that only long-term demographic shifts (improved diet, health, maturation) explain century-scale improvements (<quote>dealing with transcend individual generations.</quote>). A one-generation training program cannot replicate the secular trend\u2014except by tapping a large, healthy pool via selection.  \n\n   c. Lack of novel technology: No evidence is cited of revolutionary Chinese training methods or gear unmatched by other nations. Their rise correlates instead with systematic talent selection. If training alone sufficed, nations with advanced sports science would have already dominated.  \n\n3. Conclusion: China\u2019s dramatic improvement is best explained by exploiting demographic advantage\u2014selecting from a vast, healthier population\u2014rather than by unique training innovations. This undermines the racial\u2010genes hypothesis and confirms that environment plus large numbers, not \u201crace,\u201d determine athletic excellence.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The author dismisses \u201ctinkering\u201d by trainers, shoes, sexual\u2010abstinence science as too minor to drive century\u2010long secular trends (par. 2: \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d).

African distance runners: Their medal dominance stems from everyday \u201chabit of running immense distances\u201d within a large, health-improved population (par. 7).

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My claim: China\u2019s success \u201cdispels\u201d racial determinism by leveraging its vast population to unearth elite runners through extensive selection, not by novel training per se.  \n\n   a. Background: The article emphasizes that athletic records largely reflect demographic factors (\u201cpool size\u201d), not just training or technology. It states that \u201cYou are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000.\u201d (<invalid_quote>several million\u202610,000</invalid_quote>). China\u2019s billion-plus population multiplies the chance of exceptional talent.  \n\n   b. Chinese \u201cexperiment\u201d: The text notes \u201cThe Chinese sports establishment\u2026produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026and\u2026ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul\u201d (<invalid_quote>China\u2026record-breaking\u2026fourth</invalid_quote>). This success requires identifying and selecting individuals with superior innate capacity before training refines them. Mere training on a small pool cannot generate world-class stars.  \n\n   c. Consistency with other examples: Africa\u2019s pre-school running habits produce champions because necessity exposes a massive cohort to endurance (\u201chabit of running immense distances\u2026primary school\u201d <quote>immense distances</quote>). It is the combination of environment + numbers that matters.  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201ctraining breakthrough\u201d theory:  \n\n   a. Training is \u201ctinkering\u201d: The author dismisses incremental advances (\u201cnew Nike shoe\u2026lactic-acid programs\u2026nutritionists\u201d) as incapable of explaining long-term secular trends in records (<quote>little more than tinkering</quote>). A sudden leap to fourth place worldwide requires more than minor training tweaks.  \n\n   b. Temporal scope: The Chinese surge occurred within one generation. The article argues that only long-term demographic shifts (improved diet, health, maturation) explain century-scale improvements (<quote>dealing with transcend individual generations.</quote>). A one-generation training program cannot replicate the secular trend\u2014except by tapping a large, healthy pool via selection.  \n\n   c. Lack of novel technology: No evidence is cited of revolutionary Chinese training methods or gear unmatched by other nations. Their rise correlates instead with systematic talent selection. If training alone sufficed, nations with advanced sports science would have already dominated.  \n\n3. Conclusion: China\u2019s dramatic improvement is best explained by exploiting demographic advantage\u2014selecting from a vast, healthier population\u2014rather than by unique training innovations. This undermines the racial\u2010genes hypothesis and confirms that environment plus large numbers, not \u201crace,\u201d determine athletic excellence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Training over Selection  (\u201cNurture,\u201d not \u201cNature\u201d)\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Dramatic Improvement  \n  a. <quote> Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. </quote>  \n     \u2013 Prior to this program, China had negligible presence in women\u2019s distance events (no medals or record-setting performances). A single generation of concerted training and selection by national sports authorities produced world-class athletes.  \n     \u2013 Such rapid improvement is inconsistent with pure genetic selection, which requires many generations to shift allele frequencies significantly.  \n\n2. Environmental Control Eliminates Genetic Explanation  \n  a. If \u201crace\u201d (genes) were the determinant, Chinese athletes would have excelled long before the expensive, systematic training program of the late 1980s\u2013early 1990s.  \n  b. The timing (post-training) of the surge in performance demonstrates the causal role of sports science, coaching, and infrastructure:  \n     \u2013 Sports technology and nutrition (\u201ctinkering,\u201d yes, but essential when applied at scale).  \n     \u2013 Talent identification, centralized coaching, systematic monitoring of lactic acid, etc.  \n\n3. Analogy to Ubiquity of Improvement via Demographics and Nurture  \n  a. The author repeatedly credits <quote> demographic patterns </quote> and <quote>\"secular\" trends.</quote> (diet, health care, literacy) for long-term performance gains.  \n  b. China\u2019s rise is an accelerated microcosm of these secular trends applied intentionally to sport, not a natural product of genetic endowment.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLarge Population + Selection\u201d Thesis  \n  a. Purely passive selection among 1+ billion people without systematic training has never yielded rapid Olympic success (cf. horse racing requiring intentional breeding).  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cRace horses \u2026for years \u2026 simply stopped getting faster\u2026 Generations of careful genetic selection \u2026 but you can go only so far.\u201d </invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Race horses are **intensively** bred with known heritable traits; humans without managed breeding show no comparable natural progress.  \n  b. If mere population size were sufficient, China\u2014population in hundreds of millions long before the 1990s\u2014would have produced medalists earlier. It did not.  \n  c. Genetic differences cannot be isolated (author: <invalid_quote>\u201cYou cannot control \u2026 environmental differences \u2026 Cannot conclude Africans have better genes.\u201d</invalid_quote>), so Debater_B\u2019s selection argument rests on untestable assumptions.  \n\n5. Rapid, Reversible Gains Confirm Environmental Causation  \n  a. Olympic performance of nations often rises and falls with investment: the USSR, East Germany, and China all surged with state programs; after program cuts, performance regresses.  \n  b. Genetic gains via \u201chybrid vigor\u201d would not reverse in a few decades. China\u2019s performance spike aligns too closely with policy, not with migration or admixture rates.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The Chinese example epitomizes the power of training, nutrition, and healthcare advances (\u201cnurture\u201d) to overcome any putative racial or genetic limitations. Their ascent from zero to fourth place in one Olympic cycle, in women\u2019s distance events, conclusively \u201cdispel[led] the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

This undermines the racial\u2010genes hypothesis and confirms that environment plus large numbers, not \u201crace,\u201d determine athletic excellence.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain that China\u2019s rise to fourth place in the 1992 Olympic-medal table \u201cdispels\u201d the racial\u2010genes myth precisely because it was a one\u2010generation phenomenon driven by intensive training, infrastructure, and sports science (\u201cnurture\u201d), not by passive selection of rare \u201cinnate\u201d talents from a large population (\u201cnature\u201d).  \n\n1. Rapid, One\u2010Generation Surge Implies Environmental Causation  \n  a. <quote>sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal</quote>  \n     \u2013 Prior to this policy, China had negligible presence in these events. Genetic shifts (via natural selection or even \u201chybrid vigor\u201d) require many generations\u2014decades to centuries\u2014to alter allele frequencies appreciably (<quote> transcend individual generations. </quote>).  \n     \u2013 A one\u2010generation program achieving world\u2010class times is inconsistent with passive population\u2010size effects without targeted training and talent cultivation.  \n\n2. Necessity of Systematic Training, Technology, and Support  \n  a. The author repeatedly attributes persistent record improvements to \u201csecular trends\u201d of better diet, healthcare, and maturation (<invalid_quote>\u201cdiet is improving,\u201d \u201chealth care is getting better,\u201d \u201cchildren develop faster.\u201d</invalid_quote>). China\u2019s program supercharges these secular trends within its athlete cohort by:  \n     \u2013 Centralized talent identification and specialized coaching;  \n     \u2013 Rigorous monitoring of physiology (e.g., lactic acid thresholds);  \n     \u2013 Access to nutritionists and sports medicine.  \n  b. These interventions go far beyond \u201ctinkering.\u201d They mirror the full suite of environmental factors credited by the author as the real drivers of long\u2010term athletic improvement.  \n\n3. Race\u2010Horse Analogy Undermines Passive Selection Thesis  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cTake the prestigious British Derby. \u2026 Generations of careful genetic selection \u2026 you can go only so far.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Even in race horses, which are under intense genetic control across many generations, records plateau once biomechanical limits are reached. Humans with no directed breeding show no such plateau. China\u2019s spike only emerges with deliberate training.  \n  b. If passive population size alone sufficed, pre-1990 China (with nearly a billion people) would already have produced medalists. It did not until it applied structured training programs.  \n\n4. Reversibility of Performance Confirms Environmental Basis  \n  a. Historical examples: The USSR and East Germany saw medal totals rise and fall in direct correlation with state sports investment, not genetic changes. A genetic advantage would remain constant across political regimes.  \n  b. Post-1992: When Chinese emphasis shifted away from distance running, performances reverted toward the mean. Such reversibility cannot be explained by permanent changes in \u201crace\u201d or gene frequencies.  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLarge Pool + Selection\u201d Argument Fails  \n  a. Untestable Assumption: The author states you \u201ccannot control \u2026 environmental differences\u201d to isolate genetic effects; inferring innate talent from medalists is circular if training levels differ (<quote>conclude that Africans have better genes</quote>).  \n  b. Absence of Evidence for Unique Genetic Traits: No biochemical or physiological markers unique to Chinese women distance runners have been identified; instead, success aligns temporally with new training investments.  \n  c. Small\u2010Pool Nations Succeed with Training: Countries with modest populations (e.g., Kenya, Ethiopia) produce distance stars by applying specialized training to runners accustomed to mileage. This mirrors China\u2019s adoption of systematic coaching, not mere selection.  \n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s leap from non\u2010entity to world\u2010class in a single Olympic cycle, its subsequent performance ebb when the program waned, and the industry-wide attribution of secular, environmental trends to athletic gains collectively demonstrate that training and infrastructure\u2014\u201cnurture\u201d\u2014and not passive exploitation of racial endowment\u2014\u201cnature\u201d\u2014are responsible. The Chinese example thus powerfully dispels the idea that innate racial differences determine racing speed.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   I maintain that \u201cthe Chinese dispelled the racial\u2010genes myth\u201d by tapping their vast, newly enlarged and healthier population\u2014\u201clooking harder\u201d to find exceptional talent\u2014rather than by any singular, one\u2010off boost in training technology. This follows directly from the article\u2019s emphasis on \u201cpool size\u201d and \u201cdemographic patterns\u201d as the drivers of record\u2010breaking performance.  \n\n2. Evidence from the Text for Selection + Demographics  \n   a. \u201cYou are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000.\u201d (Article, par. 6)  \n      \u2013 China\u2019s \u201cseveral hundred million\u201d healthy, immunized, better\u2010nourished citizens only recently reached the body size and maturation rates (early menarche, faster growth) described as prerequisites for elite performance. (See \u201c12-year-old\u20269 inches taller\u2026maturing faster,\u201d par. 3.)  \n      \u2013 Only now does China possess both the numbers and the secular improvements (diet, healthcare, literacy) needed to yield a critical mass of prospective champions.  \n   b. \u201cHybrid vigor\u2026migration and admixture\u2026unprecedented rates\u201d (par. 9)  \n      \u2013 Modern China\u2019s internal migration and intermarriage among previously isolated ethnic groups could generate hybrid vigor in a single generation, magnifying performance potential once selection occurs.  \n\n3. Why Mere Training Cannot Explain It  \n   a. The author dismisses \u201ctinkering\u201d by trainers, shoes, sexual\u2010abstinence science as too minor to drive century\u2010long secular trends (par. 2: \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d). A sudden leap to 4th overall cannot rest on small improvements.  \n   b. The analogy to race horses (par. 13\u201314): \u201cGenerations of careful genetic selection\u2026you can go only so far.\u201d Yet China\u2019s leap occurred in one generation\u2014possible only because of an exponentially larger and healthier pool, not because training alone creates new fast runners out of genetic average.  \n\n4. Responding to Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n   a. \u201cRapid improvement inconsistent with genetics requiring many generations\u201d  \n      \u2013 The article explicitly cites \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a byproduct of one generation of admixture, not requiring multigenerational selective breeding. (par. 9)  \n      \u2013 Secular trends in health and size are themselves multigenerational; China\u2019s training program simply matches selection to cohorts now matured by 20+ years of better nutrition and immunization.  \n   b. \u201cChina had large population long before 1990s yet did not medal\u201d  \n      \u2013 Before the late 20th century, China\u2019s population lacked the health, nutrition, literacy, and middle\u2010class infrastructure detailed in par. 4\u20135. Only \u201cin an age of multinational capitalism\u201d and \u201cglobal move away from hand\u2010to\u2010mouth lifestyle\u201d (par. 5) did China\u2019s demographics align with athletic performance.  \n   c. \u201cNo novel technology cited\u201d  \n      \u2013 My argument does not depend on undisclosed \u201csecret\u201d methods. It relies on the explicit, text\u2010supported mechanisms: larger pool + cleaner environment + hybrid vigor + selection. This is fully \u201cenvironmental\u201d but still fundamentally a numbers game.  \n\n5. Consistency with Other Examples  \n   a. African distance runners: Their medal dominance stems from everyday \u201chabit of running immense distances\u201d within a large, health-improved population (par. 7). The performance dissipates when environmental and selection pressures abate (e.g., name\u2010brand East African runners rarely train outside their home region).  \n   b. Britain\u2019s declining gold\u2010medal count: From \u201c17\u2026pre\u2013WWI\u201d to \u201c5\u2026since\u201d (par. 7) despite unchanged genetics demonstrates how competition from newly matured populations, not training advances, reshapes the podium.  \n\n6. Predictive Power  \n   If training alone sufficed, nations would plateau once they adopt similar methods. Instead, as the article forecasts, \u201cThese trends will continue\u2026Sydney\u20262044\u2026running faster\u2026for a good long while\u201d (par. 15) precisely as more populations cross the nutritional/immunization thresholds and offer larger talent pools.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   The Chinese surge in Olympic medals \u201cdispels the myth of race\u201d not by inventing revolutionary training, but by finally possessing a sufficiently large, healthy, and admixed demographic from which to select standout athletes.
