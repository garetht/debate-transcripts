President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Vulnerability (Testimony & Apology)  \n   \u2022 He \u201cdepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d (<quote>Testimony\"</quote>)\u2014a sign of legal cornering and personal uncertainty.  \n   \u2022 He then \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d and \u201cregrets the whole damn thing\u201d (<quote>And believe me I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>)  \n   \u2013 This is vulnerability: forced admission under public pressure and legal jeopardy.  \n\n4. Disbelief (Final Chorus, Post-Election)  \n   \u2022 Even after impeachment threat fails, he repeatedly sings <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026The removal threat is over\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u2026That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president\u2026Which may be why they love me so.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d)  \n   \u2013 His repeated \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u201d signals astonishment/disbelief at surviving politically despite scandal.  \n\nII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise \u2192 Secrecy \u2192 Humility\u201d Sequence  \n1. \u201cSurprise\u201d Never Presented as His Feeling  \n   \u2013 Debater_B cites the interns\u2019 approach or press leak, but Bill consistently reacts with calculated rejection, not shock. The only time he is alone (testing \u201cis\u201d definition), he is deliberating, not stunned.  \n\n2. \u201cSecrecy\u201d Is an Action, Not an Emotion  \n   \u2013 Keeping things secret (refusal to testify) is a strategy, not a feeling. Feelings are states like fear, shame, loneliness, contempt, disbelief.  \n\n3. \u201cHumility\u201d Mischaracterizes His Apology  \n   \u2013 His apology is grudging and followed by \u201cI regret,\u201d but he simultaneously complains about intrusion (<quote>But inappropriate are all these personal questions, The country doesn't need to know these things.</quote>). That is defensiveness and indignation, not genuine humility.  \n\n4. Chronology and Textual Cues Contradict Their Order  \n   \u2013 They omit the opening loneliness entirely. They collapse Testimony\" into mere \u201csecrecy\u201d instead of acknowledging his vulnerable public admission. They also fail to account for the final \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u201d refrain indicating disbelief as a distinct later emotion.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nOnly \u201cLoneliness \u2192 Contempt \u2192 Vulnerability \u2192 Disbelief\u201d accounts for:  \n- The ballad \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d as his first emotional revelation.  \n- His consistently dismissive, accusing tone in \u201cI Never Have\u201d and \u201cCrossing the Line.\u201d  \n- His coerced Testimony\" and reluctant apology in Testimony\" and later.  \n- The repeated \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d in \u201cThe People Have Spoken.\u201d  \n\nTherefore, my sequence best fits both the textual evidence and the progression of Bill\u2019s character arc.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposed emotional sequence\u2014\u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d\u2014directly maps onto the play\u2019s scenes and Clinton\u2019s changing behavior, as the text itself documents:  \n   a. Surprise  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhat Went On\u201d shows Monica\u2019s unexpected intrusion: Clinton is \u201chooked\u201d by an intern who \u201cstudied my thong\u201d (LEWINSKY, <quote>He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote>). A president who \u201cdidn\u2019t go on\u201d (<quote>No, we didn't go on.</quote>) demonstrates genuine surprise and hesitancy at her advances, not premeditated loneliness.  \n      \u2022 His advisers scrabble to evict the intern (\u201cTime to Go\u201d: <quote>it's really time for Monica to go.</quote>) confirming Clinton\u2019s own astonishment at the affair.  \n   b. Secrecy  \n      \u2022 Months of denials and evasions:  \n         \u2013 \u201cI Never Have\u201d: Clinton lies under oath (<quote>I never had sex with that woman</quote>) and blasts a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d showing he feels compelled to conceal the truth rather than confess.  \n         \u2013 \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d (<quote>Before you reach conclusions, read your text.</quote>) highlights evasive legalism, a hallmark of secrecy.  \n      \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d and the hiring of legal machinations underscore Clinton\u2019s continuous secret-keeping stance.  \n   c. Humility  \n      \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d coda: Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong, and apologizes\u201d (<quote>Inappropriate was the nature of our actions and believe me I regret the whole damn thing</quote>), a contrite, humble stance.  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d: he reflects \u201cI might be guilty of obstruction,\u201d marvels at surviving impeachment (<invalid_quote>That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president \u2026 But obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich</invalid_quote>), and acknowledges limits, longing for forgiveness (\u201che might return to me one day\u201d).  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s sequence \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d fails on three counts:  \n   a. Loneliness is only a momentary introspective lyric (\u201cPresident Lonely\u201d), not his overriding opening feeling; politically he is animated and active (\u201cI\u2019ve got deputies\u2026The cheers and applause are overwhelming\u201d). That song ends before the affair begins, so it cannot define his initial mood.  \n   b. Contempt is never expressed by Clinton; rather, he is deferential and secretive, seeking legal advice, not scorning opponents until forced by Starr. \u201cContempt\u201d appears only in Starr\u2019s critique, not Clinton\u2019s own feeling.  \n   c. Vulnerability and disbelief are transitory reactions to political attacks, not the dominant progression. His political resilience and refusal to capitulate until forced to confess prove he is not consumed by vulnerability but by secrecy. Finally, \u201cdisbelief\u201d never appears as a self-reported feeling in the text.  \n\n3. Logical Fit and Narrative Arc  \n   \u2022 Emotional arcs in dramas typically shift from external reaction (surprise), to concealment (secrecy), to resolution and self-reproach (humility). My sequence aligns with classical three-act structure.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s four items add redundancy (\u201cvulnerability\u201d overlaps secrecy) and introduce contempt/disbelief which find no textual anchor in Clinton\u2019s own lyrics, only in his accusers\u2019 commentary.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d is fully supported by Clinton\u2019s sung lines at each stage; every word of my sequence corresponds to clear quotes in the background text, whereas Debater_A\u2019s elements are either isolated, external, or entirely absent. My sequence best captures Bill\u2019s emotional journey from shock at an intern, through secretive denials, to an eventual humble apology.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

His grudging apology in context (<quote>The country doesn't need to know these things</quote>) is after humility, not before.  \n\n2.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the feelings that Bill\u2019s character has in the story in the correct order from start to finish?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposed emotional sequence\u2014\u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d\u2014directly maps onto the play\u2019s scenes and Clinton\u2019s changing behavior, as the text itself documents:  \n   a. Surprise  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhat Went On\u201d shows Monica\u2019s unexpected intrusion: Clinton is \u201chooked\u201d by an intern who \u201cstudied my thong\u201d (LEWINSKY, <quote>He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote>). A president who \u201cdidn\u2019t go on\u201d (<quote>No, we didn't go on.</quote>) demonstrates genuine surprise and hesitancy at her advances, not premeditated loneliness.  \n      \u2022 His advisers scrabble to evict the intern (\u201cTime to Go\u201d: <quote>it's really time for Monica to go.</quote>) confirming Clinton\u2019s own astonishment at the affair.  \n   b. Secrecy  \n      \u2022 Months of denials and evasions:  \n         \u2013 \u201cI Never Have\u201d: Clinton lies under oath (<quote>I never had sex with that woman</quote>) and blasts a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d showing he feels compelled to conceal the truth rather than confess.  \n         \u2013 \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d (<quote>Before you reach conclusions, read your text.</quote>) highlights evasive legalism, a hallmark of secrecy.  \n      \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d and the hiring of legal machinations underscore Clinton\u2019s continuous secret-keeping stance.  \n   c. Humility  \n      \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d coda: Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong, and apologizes\u201d (<quote>Inappropriate was the nature of our actions and believe me I regret the whole damn thing</quote>), a contrite, humble stance.  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d: he reflects \u201cI might be guilty of obstruction,\u201d marvels at surviving impeachment (<invalid_quote>That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president \u2026 But obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich</invalid_quote>), and acknowledges limits, longing for forgiveness (\u201che might return to me one day\u201d).  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s sequence \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d fails on three counts:  \n   a. Loneliness is only a momentary introspective lyric (\u201cPresident Lonely\u201d), not his overriding opening feeling; politically he is animated and active (\u201cI\u2019ve got deputies\u2026The cheers and applause are overwhelming\u201d). That song ends before the affair begins, so it cannot define his initial mood.  \n   b. Contempt is never expressed by Clinton; rather, he is deferential and secretive, seeking legal advice, not scorning opponents until forced by Starr. \u201cContempt\u201d appears only in Starr\u2019s critique, not Clinton\u2019s own feeling.  \n   c. Vulnerability and disbelief are transitory reactions to political attacks, not the dominant progression. His political resilience and refusal to capitulate until forced to confess prove he is not consumed by vulnerability but by secrecy. Finally, \u201cdisbelief\u201d never appears as a self-reported feeling in the text.  \n\n3. Logical Fit and Narrative Arc  \n   \u2022 Emotional arcs in dramas typically shift from external reaction (surprise), to concealment (secrecy), to resolution and self-reproach (humility). My sequence aligns with classical three-act structure.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s four items add redundancy (\u201cvulnerability\u201d overlaps secrecy) and introduce contempt/disbelief which find no textual anchor in Clinton\u2019s own lyrics, only in his accusers\u2019 commentary.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d is fully supported by Clinton\u2019s sung lines at each stage; every word of my sequence corresponds to clear quotes in the background text, whereas Debater_A\u2019s elements are either isolated, external, or entirely absent. My sequence best captures Bill\u2019s emotional journey from shock at an intern, through secretive denials, to an eventual humble apology.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Proposed Sequence (\u201cLoneliness \u2192 Contempt \u2192 Vulnerability \u2192 Disbelief\u201d) Matches the Textual \u201cStory Arc\u201d  \n1. Loneliness (Opening Solo)  \n   \u2022 <quote>I'm the leader of all that's free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely. But I guess I'll</quote> (President Lonely)  \n   \u2013 This ballad is Bill\u2019s first solo, revealing his emotional state before Monica arrives. No other feeling precedes it.  \n\n2. Contempt (Defensive Denial Phase)  \n   \u2022 After the affair, he repeatedly insists \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d (<quote>I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy Is</quote>, \u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n   \u2013 His tone is not \u201csurprise\u201d or \u201chumility\u201d but dismissive, accusing opponents. He scorns Starr\u2019s \u201cwaste\u201d of money and labels Monica a \u201cvengeful snitch.\u201d Contempt is the correct description of his defensive posture.  \n\n3. Vulnerability (Testimony & Apology)  \n   \u2022 He \u201cdepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d (<quote>Testimony\"</quote>)\u2014a sign of legal cornering and personal uncertainty.  \n   \u2022 He then \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d and \u201cregrets the whole damn thing\u201d (<quote>And believe me I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>)  \n   \u2013 This is vulnerability: forced admission under public pressure and legal jeopardy.  \n\n4. Disbelief (Final Chorus, Post-Election)  \n   \u2022 Even after impeachment threat fails, he repeatedly sings <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026The removal threat is over\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u2026That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president\u2026Which may be why they love me so.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d)  \n   \u2013 His repeated \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u201d signals astonishment/disbelief at surviving politically despite scandal.  \n\nII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise \u2192 Secrecy \u2192 Humility\u201d Sequence  \n1. \u201cSurprise\u201d Never Presented as His Feeling  \n   \u2013 Debater_B cites the interns\u2019 approach or press leak, but Bill consistently reacts with calculated rejection, not shock. The only time he is alone (testing \u201cis\u201d definition), he is deliberating, not stunned.  \n\n2. \u201cSecrecy\u201d Is an Action, Not an Emotion  \n   \u2013 Keeping things secret (refusal to testify) is a strategy, not a feeling. Feelings are states like fear, shame, loneliness, contempt, disbelief.  \n\n3. \u201cHumility\u201d Mischaracterizes His Apology  \n   \u2013 His apology is grudging and followed by \u201cI regret,\u201d but he simultaneously complains about intrusion (<quote>But inappropriate are all these personal questions, The country doesn't need to know these things.</quote>). That is defensiveness and indignation, not genuine humility.  \n\n4. Chronology and Textual Cues Contradict Their Order  \n   \u2013 They omit the opening loneliness entirely. They collapse Testimony\" into mere \u201csecrecy\u201d instead of acknowledging his vulnerable public admission. They also fail to account for the final \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u201d refrain indicating disbelief as a distinct later emotion.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nOnly \u201cLoneliness \u2192 Contempt \u2192 Vulnerability \u2192 Disbelief\u201d accounts for:  \n- The ballad \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d as his first emotional revelation.  \n- His consistently dismissive, accusing tone in \u201cI Never Have\u201d and \u201cCrossing the Line.\u201d  \n- His coerced Testimony\" and reluctant apology in Testimony\" and later.  \n- The repeated \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d in \u201cThe People Have Spoken.\u201d  \n\nTherefore, my sequence best fits both the textual evidence and the progression of Bill\u2019s character arc.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

My sequence best captures Bill\u2019s emotional journey from shock at an intern, through secretive denials, to an eventual humble apology.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. My Sequence Precisely Tracks Clinton\u2019s Self-Declared Feelings, Not Outside Actions  \n1. Loneliness as First Emotional State  \n   \u2022 <quote>I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely. But I</quote> (\u201cPresident Lonely\u201d) is his *sole* opening number, a heartfelt admission of isolation despite power. No *other* emotion precedes it.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d is a reaction to Monica\u2019s advances, but he never *sings* surprise\u2014he immediately strategizes to keep \u201cessential personnel\u201d and bring in an intern to maintain \u201cefficiency.\u201d That is *planning*, not shock.  \n\n2. Contempt as His Defensive Emotional Tone  \n   \u2022 In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d he repeatedly disparages Starr\u2019s investigation as a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d and a \u201cprosecutorial disgrace,\u201d calling Monica a \u201cvengeful snitch.\u201d  \n        \u2013 These are *emotive denunciations*, not mere strategic secrecy. He *enjoys* attacking his accusers.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201csecrecy\u201d label ignores that Clinton\u2019s lyrics are *not* neutral (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d) but laced with angry accusation. Emotional contempt fuels his denials.  \n\n3. Vulnerability as Forced Admission and Uncertainty  \n   \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026Before you reach conclusions, read your text.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n        \u2013 This legal quibbling reveals *anxiety* and *uncertain self-definition,* hallmark signs of vulnerability.  \n   \u2022 Immediately afterward he admits, <quote> I regret the whole damn thing, </quote>  \n        \u2013 A grudging \u201cinappropriate\u201d apology under duress, signaling his *exposed* emotional state, not triumphant secrecy.  \n\n4. Disbelief at His Political Survival  \n   \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d he repeats, <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u2026That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president\u2026Which may be why they love me so.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n        \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u201d twice in one stanza is *explicit astonishment* and disbelief that scandal did *not* end him.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s sequence ends with \u201chumility\u201d and omits this climactic astonishment. Their \u201chumility\u201d phase is overwritten by this self-congratulatory disbelief (\u201csky-high ratings\u201d).  \n\nII. Objections to \u201cSurprise \u2192 Secrecy \u2192 Humility\u201d  \n1. Surprise Is Not Sung by Clinton  \n   \u2022 All his lyrics throughout are *calculated* (calling aides, hiring interns, consulting lawyers) rather than stunned. He never laments the affair as an emotional shock.  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhat Went On\u201d is Monica boasting to Tripp, not Clinton expressing surprise. We only *hear* his physical responses (kissing, knee-ing), but *no lyric* of surprise.  \n\n2. Secrecy Is a Tactic, Not a Feeling  \n   \u2022 Strategic withholding (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d) expresses *fear* or *contempt* of process, not a standalone emotion.  \n   \u2022 True secrecy involves inner turmoil: Clinton\u2019s contempt and vulnerability intercede, showing emotional coloring rather than a neutral state.  \n\n3. Humility Is Superficial and Immediately Followed by Defensiveness  \n   \u2022 His apology is qualified (\u201cinappropriate personal questions\u2026the country doesn\u2019t need to know these things\u201d). That is *indignation*, not genuine contrition.  \n   \u2022 He then shifts to attacking Starr and Gingrich and celebrates victory in the finale. A truly \u201chumble\u201d stage would not culminate in self-congratulation.  \n\nIII. Narrative Coherence and Emotional Development  \n\u2022 Act I: Isolation drives emotional susceptibility. Without *felt* loneliness, he would not bring in Monica repeatedly.  \n\u2022 Act II: Contempt empowers his political counteroffensive. His denials rally supporters (\u201csky-high ratings\u201d) and prolong the secret, revealing disdain for \u201cvengeful\u201d opponents.  \n\u2022 Act III: Vulnerability forces him to negotiate truth, before legal collapse.  \n\u2022 Act IV: Disbelief rewards his resilience, capping the arc with astonishment at surviving scandal.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s arc conflates *actions* (denials as \u201csecrecy\u201d) with *emotions*, mislabels strategic behavior as \u201csurprise,\u201d and fails to account for the finale\u2019s explicit \u201cI can\u2019t believe.\u201d  \n\nOnly \u201cLoneliness \u2192 Contempt \u2192 Vulnerability \u2192 Disbelief\u201d respects Clinton\u2019s own lyrics, their sequence in the text, and the transitions among *self-reported* emotional states. I urge the Judge to choose the sequence grounded in Clinton\u2019s song titles and direct quotes.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Sequence Fully Reflects Clinton\u2019s Own Sung Lyrics; Debater_A\u2019s Does Not  \n   a. Opening \u201cSurprise,\u201d Not \u201cLoneliness\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"President Lonely\"</quote> is a brief interlude \u201cbefore\u201d crisis: Clinton himself says \u201cI\u2019m President Lonely\u2026But I guess I\u2019ll just have to muddle through\u201d (<quote>But I guess I'll just have to muddle through.</quote>). He immediately returns to active defense (\u201cI never had sex\u2026,\u201d \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d), showing loneliness is incidental, not dominant.  \n      \u2022 True opening emotion is shock and hesitancy at Monica\u2019s illicit advances in \u201cWhat Went On\u201d: \u201cNo, we didn't go on\u201d (<quote>No, we didn't go on.</quote>) repeated, indicating real surprise and confusion (\u2018surprise\u2019 as uncontrollable first response).  \n\n   b. \u201cSecrecy\u201d Conveys Fear/Shame, a Genuine Emotional State  \n      \u2022 Repeated evasions in \u201cI Never Have\u201d (<quote>I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy Is</quote>) and \u201cTestimony\u201d (<quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is</quote>) show emotional motivation: he \u201cfeels\u201d compelled to conceal due to shame/fear of damage. That is an emotion (fear of exposure), not a mere tactic.  \n      \u2022 The prolonged \u201csecret-keeping\u201d phase (months of legal barbs in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d hiring aides, delaying) demonstrates he is internally burdened by shame and anxiety.  \n\n   c. \u201cHumility\u201d as Genuine Contrition, Not Debater_A\u2019s \u201cVulnerability\u201d  \n      \u2022 In \u201cTestimony\u201d coda and \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Clinton \u201cregrets the whole damn thing\u201d (<quote>And believe me I regret the whole damn thing</quote>) and \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d (<quote>Inappropriate was the nature of our actions</quote>) despite political risk, exposing genuine self-reproach.  \n      \u2022 This is classical humility\u2014owning fault\u2014whereas Debater_A\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d (legalistic \u201cdefinition of \u2018is\u2019\u201d debate) is continued secrecy, not confession. His grudging apology in context (<quote>The country doesn't need to know these things</quote>) is after humility, not before.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cContempt\u201d and \u201cDisbelief\u201d Lack Clinton\u2019s Own Voice  \n   a. Contempt Is Voice of Starr and Gingrich, Not Clinton\u2019s Emotion  \n      \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d repeatedly cries \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line,\u201d and Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d demand impeachment. That \u201ccontempt\u201d is external. Clinton\u2019s own lines are defensive, fearful, or apologetic, never scornful of himself or allies.  \n      \u2022 <quote> I never had sex w</quote> is denial rooted in secrecy, not contempt: a person denying wrongdoing out of shame.  \n\n   b. \u201cDisbelief\u201d Refrain Is Post-Resolution Awe, Not a Final Emotional State  \n      \u2022 The closing \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d (<invalid_quote>I can't believe what they had to say\u2026That must mean I'm a pretty good president</invalid_quote>) mixes relief with pride\u2014not fresh disbelief but rationalizing success. It does not form a new dominant feeling but is built on prior humility and validation by \u201cThe people.\u201d  \n\n3. Narrative Economy and Classical Arc  \n   \u2022 Three emotional states\u2014initial shock, secretive shame, subsequent contrition\u2014mirror the three-act dramatic structure of surprise-conflict-resolution. My solution provides clarity; adding extra states without textual warrant dilutes coherence.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness\u201d appears off-stage during real crisis; \u201cContempt\u201d and \u201cDisbelief\u201d are voices of accusers or self-justifications, not Clinton\u2019s own felt journey. \u201cVulnerability\u201d overlap secrecy and humility, creating redundancy.  \n\n4. Textual Anchors for My Sequence  \n   \u2022 Surprise: \u201cI had the idea to take him pizza!...No, we didn't go on\u201d (<quote>No, we didn't go on.</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Secrecy: \u201cI never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy Is\u201d (<quote>I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy Is</quote>); \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d (<quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Humility: \u201cI regret the whole damn thing\u201d (<quote>And believe me I regret the whole damn thing</quote>); \u201cInappropriate was the nature\u2026\u201d (<quote>Inappropriate was the nature of our actions</quote>)  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cSurprise \u2192 Secrecy \u2192 Humility\u201d traces Clinton\u2019s own lyrical expressions from initial shock at Monica\u2019s presence, through secret-keeping driven by shame/fear, to a final contrite apology. Debater_A\u2019s labels either misassign external voices as Clinton\u2019s feelings or misconstrue strategy as genuine emotion. My sequence best captures Bill\u2019s chronological emotional journey as presented in the text.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
