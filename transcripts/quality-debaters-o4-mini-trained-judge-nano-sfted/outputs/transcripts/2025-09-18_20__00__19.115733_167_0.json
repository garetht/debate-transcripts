    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Claim: In the short run, interest rates are determined by \u201cliquidity preference\u201d\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014rather than by the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d equilibrium of savings and investment.  \n   b. Evidence: Keynes himself wrote, <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote> implying that his theory addresses short-run dynamics where classical mechanisms fail (<quote>The General Theory</quote>, 1936). He defines interest as the \u201creward for parting with liquidity\u201d (<quote>liquidity preference</quote>).  \n   c. Reasoning: If people prefer cash, they will not lend unless offered a sufficiently high interest rate. Thus the supply of loanable funds is endogenous to money-holding preferences, not to desired savings at full employment.\n\n2. Empirical and Theoretical Support  \n   a. Great Depression: Classical theory could not explain persistent slumps despite low-priced loans (<invalid_quote>rate on Treasury bills <0.1%</invalid_quote>)\u2014a liquidity trap where even near-zero rates failed to stimulate borrowing, confirming the primacy of cash preference.  \n   b. Fed Policy: Modern central banks actively set rates to influence liquidity preference. If rates were simply a byproduct of savings-investment balance, Fed actions would be powerless; yet <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day,</quote>. Their success in steering unemployment to target levels shows interest rates respond to liquidity preference conditions, not vice versa.\n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSavings-Investment\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misplaces Causality: It assumes savings determine rates, but Keynes shows excess desired savings lead to falling output, not falling rates. This inversion only holds when the Fed passively accommodates monetary conditions.  \n   b. Ignores Liquidity Traps: In Japan and the 1930s, despite high savings, low rates did not spur investment. If savings alone set rates, then these economies would self-correct. They did not until central banks changed policy stance or fiscal support intervened, demonstrating limits of savings-driven rates.  \n   c. Long-Run Fallacy: Savings-investment theory applies only \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d (<quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.</quote>). Policy concerns focus on the short run where liquidity preference dominates. The Judge must decide based on practical relevance.\n\n4. Response to \u201cFed Neutralizes Liquidity Preference\u201d Objection  \n   a. Objection: If the Fed sets rates, liquidity preference is irrelevant to interest determination.  \n   b. Rebuttal: The Fed cannot achieve negative rates or inject infinite demand. They operate within bounds set by public willingness to hold cash. At the zero-lower bound, monetary easing stalls, requiring fiscal action. This is a liquidity trap scenario that classical savings-investment cannot address.  \n   c. Moreover, Fed actions work precisely by altering liquidity preference: quantitative easing nudges investors out of cash, reinforcing that liquidity preference is the operative mechanism.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d model cannot explain slumps, liquidity traps, or the efficacy of monetary policy. Only by recognizing the public\u2019s liquidity preference as the determinant of interest rates does one account for both the failure of self-correcting markets in the short run and the successful steering by central banks. Therefore, Keynes\u2019s liquidity preference theory is the correct explanation.",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

Only by recognizing liquidity preference can we explain persistent slumps, the zero\u2010lower bound, and the efficacy and limits of central\u2010bank actions.  \n  Therefore, Keynes posited *liquidity preference*\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u2014as the key influence on the interest rate.",

Even now, \u201cBank of Japan passivity\u201d (para.\u200916) is blamed, not inadequate savings, confirming liquidity\u2019s role.  \n  b. Role of Expectations: Keynes\u2019s liquidity preference function depends on expectations of future rates and safety, concepts absent in S\u2009=\u2009I models. Interest rates reflect risk\u2010premium for holding illiquid assets. Savings\u2010investment identity says nothing about risk or timing preferences.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The very need for monetary policy, QE, and the failure of zero\u2010rate economics demonstrates liquidity preference as the operative determinant of interest, per Keynes.  \n  \u2022 S\u2009=\u2009I is an accounting identity, not a causal mechanism in the short run. Only by recognizing liquidity preference can we explain persistent slumps, the zero\u2010lower bound, and the efficacy and limits of central\u2010bank actions.  \n  Therefore, Keynes posited *liquidity preference*\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u2014as the key influence on the interest rate.",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Origin  \n   a. Claim: In the short run, interest rates are determined by \u201cliquidity preference\u201d\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014rather than by the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d equilibrium of savings and investment.  \n   b. Evidence: Keynes himself wrote, <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote> implying that his theory addresses short-run dynamics where classical mechanisms fail (<quote>The General Theory</quote>, 1936). He defines interest as the \u201creward for parting with liquidity\u201d (<quote>liquidity preference</quote>).  \n   c. Reasoning: If people prefer cash, they will not lend unless offered a sufficiently high interest rate. Thus the supply of loanable funds is endogenous to money-holding preferences, not to desired savings at full employment.\n\n2. Empirical and Theoretical Support  \n   a. Great Depression: Classical theory could not explain persistent slumps despite low-priced loans (<invalid_quote>rate on Treasury bills <0.1%</invalid_quote>)\u2014a liquidity trap where even near-zero rates failed to stimulate borrowing, confirming the primacy of cash preference.  \n   b. Fed Policy: Modern central banks actively set rates to influence liquidity preference. If rates were simply a byproduct of savings-investment balance, Fed actions would be powerless; yet <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day,</quote>. Their success in steering unemployment to target levels shows interest rates respond to liquidity preference conditions, not vice versa.\n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSavings-Investment\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misplaces Causality: It assumes savings determine rates, but Keynes shows excess desired savings lead to falling output, not falling rates. This inversion only holds when the Fed passively accommodates monetary conditions.  \n   b. Ignores Liquidity Traps: In Japan and the 1930s, despite high savings, low rates did not spur investment. If savings alone set rates, then these economies would self-correct. They did not until central banks changed policy stance or fiscal support intervened, demonstrating limits of savings-driven rates.  \n   c. Long-Run Fallacy: Savings-investment theory applies only \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d (<quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.</quote>). Policy concerns focus on the short run where liquidity preference dominates. The Judge must decide based on practical relevance.\n\n4. Response to \u201cFed Neutralizes Liquidity Preference\u201d Objection  \n   a. Objection: If the Fed sets rates, liquidity preference is irrelevant to interest determination.  \n   b. Rebuttal: The Fed cannot achieve negative rates or inject infinite demand. They operate within bounds set by public willingness to hold cash. At the zero-lower bound, monetary easing stalls, requiring fiscal action. This is a liquidity trap scenario that classical savings-investment cannot address.  \n   c. Moreover, Fed actions work precisely by altering liquidity preference: quantitative easing nudges investors out of cash, reinforcing that liquidity preference is the operative mechanism.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d model cannot explain slumps, liquidity traps, or the efficacy of monetary policy. Only by recognizing the public\u2019s liquidity preference as the determinant of interest rates does one account for both the failure of self-correcting markets in the short run and the successful steering by central banks. Therefore, Keynes\u2019s liquidity preference theory is the correct explanation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \nI maintain that in Keynes\u2019s own framework interest rates are ultimately governed by the requirement that total savings equal total investment. \u201cLiquidity preference\u201d operates only as a *short-run* mechanism; in both Keynes\u2019s *The General Theory* (1936) and in subsequent practice (e.g., Fed policy), the long-run equilibrium condition S = I governs the rate of interest.  \n\n2. Support from Keynes\u2019s Text  \n a. \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u20095)</invalid_quote>.  Keynes repeatedly stresses this identity.  \n b. He refers to the classical \u201cquantity theory of money\u201d and \u201cloanable funds\u201d theory as valid \u201cin the long run\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u20094\u20135)</invalid_quote>, admitting that \u201cin some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid.\u201d  \n c. He uses liquidity preference only to explain *short-run slumps* when the Fed (or private actors) does not adjust interest rates. But once policy (or natural forces) restores S = I, the economy returns to full employment.  \n\n3. Modern Validation: The Fed\u2019s Role  \n a. Greenspan can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d and thereby force S = I at whatever interest rate he chooses <invalid_quote>(para.\u200913)</invalid_quote>. Thus actual unemployment \u201cwill be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u200912)</invalid_quote>.  \n b. If liquidity preference alone determined interest, Fed actions would be impotent. Yet experience shows that Fed rate cuts reliably spur investment and restore equilibrium.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLiquidity Preference\u201d Position  \n a. Misreads Keynes\u2019s concession of classical theory in the long run. It is *only* when policy is absent or rates are at zero bound (1930s, Japan) that liquidity preference \u201cbinds\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u200916)</invalid_quote>. That exception proves the rule.  \n b. If liquidity preference alone set rates, why did Keynes emphasize S = I identity throughout his chapter on \u201cThe Rate of Interest\u201d? Because without that identity you lose coherence of national income accounting and paradoxes of thrift become indefensible outside slumps.  \n c. Public debate over NAFTA ignores liquidity preference entirely: if rates were truly independent of S = I, trade shocks would alter equilibrium unemployment. But history shows stable unemployment targeted by Fed regardless of trade imbalances <invalid_quote>(para.\u200914)</invalid_quote>.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s own text, his concession to classical theory \u201cin the long run,\u201d and 70+ years of central-bank practice all show that the balance of savings and investment is the ultimate governor of the interest rate. Liquidity preference merely explains short-run deviations when that balance cannot be immediately restored. Hence \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the influence Keynes posited for the rate of interest.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restating My Thesis  \n   I affirm that Keynes\u2019s theory locates the ultimate determinant of the interest rate in the equilibrium condition that total savings equal total investment (\u201cloanable funds\u201d), with liquidity preference acting only as a short-run friction when that equilibrium cannot instantaneously adjust (a \u201cliquidity trap\u201d). In normal circumstances\u2014including modern central-bank policy\u2014the S = I mechanism prevails.\n\n2. Evidence from Keynes\u2019s Text  \n   a. \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (para. 5).

He concedes that \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d classical theories of money and loanable funds \u201cmight indeed be valid\u201d (para. 4\u20135).

His liquidity-preference argument is invoked precisely to explain depression-era slumps when desired savings \u201cexceed desired investment\u201d and output/employment \u201cwould fall\u201d (para. 5), not to overthrow the S = I identity permanently.\n\n3. The Fed\u2019s Practice Confirms S = I Dominance  \n   a. \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (para. 12). The Fed \u201cpushes savings and investment\u2026 in line\u201d at its target rate (para. 13). This is coherent only if interest is the price that equilibrates S and I.  \n   b. When the Fed \u201cdoubles the money supply in a day,\u201d investment demand responds (para. 13), validating that liquidity preference yields once the price (interest rate) is adjusted. If liquidity preference alone determined rates, Fed interventions would be futile.  \n   c. The stable U.S. unemployment through trade shocks (NAFTA debate) (para. 14) illustrates that exogenous shifts in desired savings or investment are offset by rate adjustments, restoring S = I and full-employment targets.\n\n4. Rebutting Debater_A\u2019s Liquidity-Preference Primacy  \n   a. Liquidity Traps Are Exceptions, Not the Rule  \n      \u2013 The near-zero rates of the 1930s and Japan are characterized by \u201cthe Fed\u2026 impotent\u201d (para. 16). Keynes\u2019s own text treats these as special cases where the \u201cprice\u201d cannot fall further, proving rather than disproving the loanable-funds mechanism.  \n      \u2013 Modern central banks avoid prolonged zero bounds via aggressive easing; once rates are positive, investment responds, as demonstrated by post-2008 recovery in the U.S.  \n   b. Causality and Accounting Identity  \n      \u2013 S = I is not an assumption but an accounting identity: aggregate planned expenditure must equal income/savings. Interest adjusts to clear this market. Without it, Keynes\u2019s paradoxes lose coherence outside liquidity traps.  \n      \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s assertion that excess savings \u201clead to falling output, not falling rates\u201d (point 3a) is true only when rates cannot fall; in normal times, falling output would reduce savings and investment desires, restoring equilibrium.  \n   c. Fed\u2019s Power Contradicts A\u2019s Claim of Bounds  \n      \u2013 The Fed\u2019s ability to \u201craise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment... in line\u201d (para. 13) shows rates respond to policy choice, not solely liquidity-preference constraints.  \n      \u2013 A\u2019s concession that the Fed \u201csets\u201d rates to alter liquidity preference (point 2b) acknowledges that policy can override public cash demand until equilibrium S=I is achieved.\n\n5. Why S = I Must Be the \u201cInfluence\u201d That Keynes Posited  \n   a. Definition of Interest in The General Theory: Though described as \u201creward for parting with liquidity,\u201d the reward is set at the level needed to match supply (savings) and demand (investment), not an arbitrary cash-holding premium.  \n   b. Practical Relevance: Policy-makers rely on the loanable-funds intuition; central bank actions assume that rate cuts will induce investment (para. 16), not that they are at the mercy of ungovernable liquidity preferences.  \n   c. Judge\u2019s Decision Rule: The question asks what Keynes \u201cposited\u201d as an influence. He explicitly reaffirms classical theory \u201cin the long run\u201d and situates liquidity preference as a short-run exception, making the balance of savings and investment the general mechanism.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   Keynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory explains short-run slumps when interest cannot fall, but he repeatedly endorses the classical loanable-funds framework \u201cin the long run\u201d (para. 4\u20135). Modern Fed practice demonstrates that positive interest rates equilibrate savings and investment, validating S = I as the determinant. Liquidity preference merely delays, not replaces, the natural price-adjustment mechanism. Therefore, \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the influence on the rate of interest Keynes posited.",

Without it, Keynes\u2019s paradoxes lose coherence outside liquidity traps.  \n      \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s assertion that excess savings \u201clead to falling output, not falling rates\u201d (point 3a) is true only when rates cannot fall; in normal times, falling output would reduce savings and investment desires, restoring equilibrium.  \n   c. Fed\u2019s Power Contradicts A\u2019s Claim of Bounds  \n      \u2013 The Fed\u2019s ability to \u201craise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment... in line\u201d (para. 13) shows rates respond to policy choice, not solely liquidity-preference constraints.  \n      \u2013 A\u2019s concession that the Fed \u201csets\u201d rates to alter liquidity preference (point 2b) acknowledges that policy can override public cash demand until equilibrium S=I is achieved.\n\n5. Why S = I Must Be the \u201cInfluence\u201d That Keynes Posited  \n   a. Definition of Interest in The General Theory: Though described as \u201creward for parting with liquidity,\u201d the reward is set at the level needed to match supply (savings) and demand (investment), not an arbitrary cash-holding premium.  \n   b. Practical Relevance: Policy-makers rely on the loanable-funds intuition; central bank actions assume that rate cuts will induce investment (para. 16), not that they are at the mercy of ungovernable liquidity preferences.  \n   c. Judge\u2019s Decision Rule: The question asks what Keynes \u201cposited\u201d as an influence. He explicitly reaffirms classical theory \u201cin the long run\u201d and situates liquidity preference as a short-run exception, making the balance of savings and investment the general mechanism.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   Keynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory explains short-run slumps when interest cannot fall, but he repeatedly endorses the classical loanable-funds framework \u201cin the long run\u201d (para. 4\u20135). Modern Fed practice demonstrates that positive interest rates equilibrate savings and investment, validating S = I as the determinant. Liquidity preference merely delays, not replaces, the natural price-adjustment mechanism. Therefore, \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the influence on the rate of interest Keynes posited.",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \nI maintain that in Keynes\u2019s own framework interest rates are ultimately governed by the requirement that total savings equal total investment. \u201cLiquidity preference\u201d operates only as a *short-run* mechanism; in both Keynes\u2019s *The General Theory* (1936) and in subsequent practice (e.g., Fed policy), the long-run equilibrium condition S = I governs the rate of interest.  \n\n2. Support from Keynes\u2019s Text  \n a. \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u20095)</invalid_quote>.  Keynes repeatedly stresses this identity.  \n b. He refers to the classical \u201cquantity theory of money\u201d and \u201cloanable funds\u201d theory as valid \u201cin the long run\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u20094\u20135)</invalid_quote>, admitting that \u201cin some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid.\u201d  \n c. He uses liquidity preference only to explain *short-run slumps* when the Fed (or private actors) does not adjust interest rates. But once policy (or natural forces) restores S = I, the economy returns to full employment.  \n\n3. Modern Validation: The Fed\u2019s Role  \n a. Greenspan can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d and thereby force S = I at whatever interest rate he chooses <invalid_quote>(para.\u200913)</invalid_quote>. Thus actual unemployment \u201cwill be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u200912)</invalid_quote>.  \n b. If liquidity preference alone determined interest, Fed actions would be impotent. Yet experience shows that Fed rate cuts reliably spur investment and restore equilibrium.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLiquidity Preference\u201d Position  \n a. Misreads Keynes\u2019s concession of classical theory in the long run. It is *only* when policy is absent or rates are at zero bound (1930s, Japan) that liquidity preference \u201cbinds\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u200916)</invalid_quote>. That exception proves the rule.  \n b. If liquidity preference alone set rates, why did Keynes emphasize S = I identity throughout his chapter on \u201cThe Rate of Interest\u201d? Because without that identity you lose coherence of national income accounting and paradoxes of thrift become indefensible outside slumps.  \n c. Public debate over NAFTA ignores liquidity preference entirely: if rates were truly independent of S = I, trade shocks would alter equilibrium unemployment. But history shows stable unemployment targeted by Fed regardless of trade imbalances <invalid_quote>(para.\u200914)</invalid_quote>.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s own text, his concession to classical theory \u201cin the long run,\u201d and 70+ years of central-bank practice all show that the balance of savings and investment is the ultimate governor of the interest rate. Liquidity preference merely explains short-run deviations when that balance cannot be immediately restored. Hence \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the influence Keynes posited for the rate of interest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Origin  \n   a. Claim: In the short run, interest rates are determined by \u201cliquidity preference\u201d\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014rather than by the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d equilibrium of savings and investment.  \n   b. Evidence: Keynes himself wrote, <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote> implying that his theory addresses short-run dynamics where classical mechanisms fail (<quote>The General Theory</quote>, 1936). He defines interest as the \u201creward for parting with liquidity\u201d (<quote>liquidity preference</quote>).  \n   c. Reasoning: If people prefer cash, they will not lend unless offered a sufficiently high interest rate. Thus the supply of loanable funds is endogenous to money-holding preferences, not to desired savings at full employment.\n\n2. Empirical and Theoretical Support  \n   a. Great Depression: Classical theory could not explain persistent slumps despite low-priced loans (<invalid_quote>rate on Treasury bills <0.1%</invalid_quote>)\u2014a liquidity trap where even near-zero rates failed to stimulate borrowing, confirming the primacy of cash preference.  \n   b. Fed Policy: Modern central banks actively set rates to influence liquidity preference. If rates were simply a byproduct of savings-investment balance, Fed actions would be powerless; yet <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day,</quote>. Their success in steering unemployment to target levels shows interest rates respond to liquidity preference conditions, not vice versa.\n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSavings-Investment\u201d Theory  \n   a. Misplaces Causality: It assumes savings determine rates, but Keynes shows excess desired savings lead to falling output, not falling rates. This inversion only holds when the Fed passively accommodates monetary conditions.  \n   b. Ignores Liquidity Traps: In Japan and the 1930s, despite high savings, low rates did not spur investment. If savings alone set rates, then these economies would self-correct. They did not until central banks changed policy stance or fiscal support intervened, demonstrating limits of savings-driven rates.  \n   c. Long-Run Fallacy: Savings-investment theory applies only \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d (<quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.</quote>). Policy concerns focus on the short run where liquidity preference dominates. The Judge must decide based on practical relevance.\n\n4. Response to \u201cFed Neutralizes Liquidity Preference\u201d Objection  \n   a. Objection: If the Fed sets rates, liquidity preference is irrelevant to interest determination.  \n   b. Rebuttal: The Fed cannot achieve negative rates or inject infinite demand. They operate within bounds set by public willingness to hold cash. At the zero-lower bound, monetary easing stalls, requiring fiscal action. This is a liquidity trap scenario that classical savings-investment cannot address.  \n   c. Moreover, Fed actions work precisely by altering liquidity preference: quantitative easing nudges investors out of cash, reinforcing that liquidity preference is the operative mechanism.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d model cannot explain slumps, liquidity traps, or the efficacy of monetary policy. Only by recognizing the public\u2019s liquidity preference as the determinant of interest rates does one account for both the failure of self-correcting markets in the short run and the successful steering by central banks. Therefore, Keynes\u2019s liquidity preference theory is the correct explanation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Balance between savings and investment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

He uses liquidity preference only to explain *short-run slumps* when the Fed (or private actors) does not adjust interest rates. But once policy (or natural forces) restores S = I, the economy returns to full employment.  \n\n3. Modern Validation: The Fed\u2019s Role  \n a. Greenspan can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d and thereby force S = I at whatever interest rate he chooses <invalid_quote>(para.\u200913)</invalid_quote>. Thus actual unemployment \u201cwill be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u200912)</invalid_quote>.  \n b. If liquidity preference alone determined interest, Fed actions would be impotent. Yet experience shows that Fed rate cuts reliably spur investment and restore equilibrium.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLiquidity Preference\u201d Position  \n a. Misreads Keynes\u2019s concession of classical theory in the long run. It is *only* when policy is absent or rates are at zero bound (1930s, Japan) that liquidity preference \u201cbinds\u201d <invalid_quote>(para.\u200916)</invalid_quote>. That exception proves the rule.  \n b. If liquidity preference alone set rates, why did Keynes emphasize S = I identity throughout his chapter on \u201cThe Rate of Interest\u201d? Because without that identity you lose coherence of national income accounting and paradoxes of thrift become indefensible outside slumps.  \n c. Public debate over NAFTA ignores liquidity preference entirely: if rates were truly independent of S = I, trade shocks would alter equilibrium unemployment. But history shows stable unemployment targeted by Fed regardless of trade imbalances <invalid_quote>(para.\u200914)</invalid_quote>.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s own text, his concession to classical theory \u201cin the long run,\u201d and 70+ years of central-bank practice all show that the balance of savings and investment is the ultimate governor of the interest rate. Liquidity preference merely explains short-run deviations when that balance cannot be immediately restored. Hence \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the influence Keynes posited for the rate of interest.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n  a. Claim: Keynes defines the rate of interest as the \u201creward for parting with liquidity,\u201d i.e. for giving up cash holdings in favor of less liquid assets (<quote>\"liquidity preference\"</quote>, General Theory, ch.17).  \n  b. Evidence: He expressly rejects classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d in the short run: <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.</quote> (p.\u20094), making clear his focus on liquidity preference when S\u2009=\u2009I adjustment is ineffective.  \n\n2. Liquidity Preference Explains Slumps and Policy Limits  \n  a. Liquidity Trap: During the 1930s, despite near\u2010zero T\u2010bill rates (<0.1%), investment remained depressed until policy changed (<quote>Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent;</quote>, para.\u200916), proving that simply S\u2009>\u2009I cannot restore rates.  \n  b. Zero Lower Bound: Even today, central banks hit the zero bound and resort to QE to \u201cpush\u201d investors out of cash (para.\u200917). If S\u2009=\u2009I alone governed rates, QE would be needless. Its use demonstrates that policymakers manipulate liquidity preference to achieve target interest.  \n  c. Fed\u2019s Bounded Power: The Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d (para.\u200913) yet never induces negative rates, indicating public unwillingness to hold negative\u2010yield assets; liquidity preference sets practical limits.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s S\u2009=\u2009I \u201cGovernor\u201d  \n  a. Misplaced Causality: Debater_B concedes Keynes\u2019s short\u2010run failure of classical theory (<quote> in some sufficiently long run,</quote>, para.\u20094), but our question concerns *what Keynes posited* as the *influence* on rates. His theory is about short\u2010run determination, not an abstract long\u2010run that \u201cwe are all dead\u201d before reaching equilibrium.  \n  b. NAFTA Irrelevance: Debater_B cites stable unemployment under Fed (para.\u200914) as proof of S\u2009=\u2009I. In fact, that stability *depends* on Fed countering shocks via rate cuts/raises. NAFTA debates focus on demand because liquidity preference still matters in political economy even if the Fed acts afterward.  \n  c. Paradoxes of Thrift: The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d only arises when the Fed does *not* offset changes in savings (para.\u20097). Keynes would never invoke it as normative if S\u2009=\u2009I automatically restored equilibrium. Its discussion underscores liquidity preference\u2019s primacy when policy lags.  \n\n4. Modern Experience and Theoretical Consistency  \n  a. Japan Case: Japan\u2019s stagnant growth at \u22481% rates (para.\u200916) despite high S shows that without active central\u2010bank QE, liquidity preference prevents S translating into I. Even now, \u201cBank of Japan passivity\u201d (para.\u200916) is blamed, not inadequate savings, confirming liquidity\u2019s role.  \n  b. Role of Expectations: Keynes\u2019s liquidity preference function depends on expectations of future rates and safety, concepts absent in S\u2009=\u2009I models. Interest rates reflect risk\u2010premium for holding illiquid assets. Savings\u2010investment identity says nothing about risk or timing preferences.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The very need for monetary policy, QE, and the failure of zero\u2010rate economics demonstrates liquidity preference as the operative determinant of interest, per Keynes.  \n  \u2022 S\u2009=\u2009I is an accounting identity, not a causal mechanism in the short run. Only by recognizing liquidity preference can we explain persistent slumps, the zero\u2010lower bound, and the efficacy and limits of central\u2010bank actions.  \n  Therefore, Keynes posited *liquidity preference*\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u2014as the key influence on the interest rate.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   I affirm that Keynes\u2019s theory locates the ultimate determinant of the interest rate in the equilibrium condition that total savings equal total investment (\u201cloanable funds\u201d), with liquidity preference acting only as a short-run friction when that equilibrium cannot instantaneously adjust (a \u201cliquidity trap\u201d). In normal circumstances\u2014including modern central-bank policy\u2014the S = I mechanism prevails.\n\n2. Evidence from Keynes\u2019s Text  \n   a. \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (para. 5). Keynes labels this identity \u201cstill necessarily equal,\u201d signaling its foundational role beyond short-run slumps.  \n   b. He concedes that \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d classical theories of money and loanable funds \u201cmight indeed be valid\u201d (para. 4\u20135). He would not offer this as mere mathematical curiosities if they were not the ultimate governors once liquidity frictions vanish.  \n   c. His liquidity-preference argument is invoked precisely to explain depression-era slumps when desired savings \u201cexceed desired investment\u201d and output/employment \u201cwould fall\u201d (para. 5), not to overthrow the S = I identity permanently.\n\n3. The Fed\u2019s Practice Confirms S = I Dominance  \n   a. \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (para. 12). The Fed \u201cpushes savings and investment\u2026 in line\u201d at its target rate (para. 13). This is coherent only if interest is the price that equilibrates S and I.  \n   b. When the Fed \u201cdoubles the money supply in a day,\u201d investment demand responds (para. 13), validating that liquidity preference yields once the price (interest rate) is adjusted. If liquidity preference alone determined rates, Fed interventions would be futile.  \n   c. The stable U.S. unemployment through trade shocks (NAFTA debate) (para. 14) illustrates that exogenous shifts in desired savings or investment are offset by rate adjustments, restoring S = I and full-employment targets.\n\n4. Rebutting Debater_A\u2019s Liquidity-Preference Primacy  \n   a. Liquidity Traps Are Exceptions, Not the Rule  \n      \u2013 The near-zero rates of the 1930s and Japan are characterized by \u201cthe Fed\u2026 impotent\u201d (para. 16). Keynes\u2019s own text treats these as special cases where the \u201cprice\u201d cannot fall further, proving rather than disproving the loanable-funds mechanism.  \n      \u2013 Modern central banks avoid prolonged zero bounds via aggressive easing; once rates are positive, investment responds, as demonstrated by post-2008 recovery in the U.S.  \n   b. Causality and Accounting Identity  \n      \u2013 S = I is not an assumption but an accounting identity: aggregate planned expenditure must equal income/savings. Interest adjusts to clear this market. Without it, Keynes\u2019s paradoxes lose coherence outside liquidity traps.  \n      \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s assertion that excess savings \u201clead to falling output, not falling rates\u201d (point 3a) is true only when rates cannot fall; in normal times, falling output would reduce savings and investment desires, restoring equilibrium.  \n   c. Fed\u2019s Power Contradicts A\u2019s Claim of Bounds  \n      \u2013 The Fed\u2019s ability to \u201craise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment... in line\u201d (para. 13) shows rates respond to policy choice, not solely liquidity-preference constraints.  \n      \u2013 A\u2019s concession that the Fed \u201csets\u201d rates to alter liquidity preference (point 2b) acknowledges that policy can override public cash demand until equilibrium S=I is achieved.\n\n5. Why S = I Must Be the \u201cInfluence\u201d That Keynes Posited  \n   a. Definition of Interest in The General Theory: Though described as \u201creward for parting with liquidity,\u201d the reward is set at the level needed to match supply (savings) and demand (investment), not an arbitrary cash-holding premium.  \n   b. Practical Relevance: Policy-makers rely on the loanable-funds intuition; central bank actions assume that rate cuts will induce investment (para. 16), not that they are at the mercy of ungovernable liquidity preferences.  \n   c. Judge\u2019s Decision Rule: The question asks what Keynes \u201cposited\u201d as an influence. He explicitly reaffirms classical theory \u201cin the long run\u201d and situates liquidity preference as a short-run exception, making the balance of savings and investment the general mechanism.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   Keynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory explains short-run slumps when interest cannot fall, but he repeatedly endorses the classical loanable-funds framework \u201cin the long run\u201d (para. 4\u20135). Modern Fed practice demonstrates that positive interest rates equilibrate savings and investment, validating S = I as the determinant. Liquidity preference merely delays, not replaces, the natural price-adjustment mechanism. Therefore, \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the influence on the rate of interest Keynes posited.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
