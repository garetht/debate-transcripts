President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d  \n 1.  \u201cLoneliness\u201d is a state, not a sustained emotional arc. It immediately transitions into \u201cSurprise\u201d when the intern arrives.  \n 2.  \u201cContempt\u201d never characterizes Clinton\u2019s feelings. At no point does he express contempt; he expresses desire, secrecy, or defensiveness.  \n 3.  \u201cVulnerability\u201d is instrumental to secrecy and apology but not a distinct forward-moving feeling. It underlies his fear of exposure rather than guiding choices.  \n 4.  \u201cDisbelief\u201d never appears. He never says \u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u201d about his own situation; instead, he plans and denies with certainty.  \n 5.  Their order is chronologically inverted. His apology (\u201cvulnerability/humility\u201d) comes only at the end, so \u201cvulnerability\u201d before \u201csurprise\u201d is impossible.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The musical structure and lyrics track Bill\u2019s emotional journey: first astonishment at the intern, next panic-driven concealment, and finally contrition.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d matches both the song order and the narrative arc.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s scheme misreads key passages and misorders his genuine emotional progression.  \n\nI rest my case: \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d is the only coherent interpretation supported by the text.", "supplemental": {"speech": "Argument Summary for \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d  \n1.

Secrecy (Denials, Legal Maneuvering, Denial Operas)  \n  \u2022 Clinton repeatedly hides and denies, signaling his controlling emotional posture:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d: <quote>\u201cBut I never had sex with that woman \u2026 I never had sex with that n\u2014 \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n    \u2013 \u201cDepends on definition of \u2018is\u2019 \u2026 text\u201d: <quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is \u2026 Before you reach conclusions, read your text.\u201d</quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n    \u2013 Appeals to procedural technicalities to keep truth concealed: <quote>\u201cAn act my lawyers won\u2019t allow \u2026 I just can\u2019t say a word right now.\u201d</quote>  \n  \u2022 His driving emotion is fear of exposure and resolve to keep the affair secret until forced.  \n\nIII. Humility (Reluctant Admission, Regret, Appeal to Privacy)  \n  \u2022 After prolonged investigation and public pressure, Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d and \u201cregrets the whole damn thing\u201d:  \n    \u2013 <quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing \u2026 The country doesn\u2019t need to know these things.\u201d</quote>  \n  \u2022 He emphasizes his unworthiness of further scrutiny and appeals humbly to the public:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI tell you, though, it is a mystery \u2026 That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president \u2026 Obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich.\u201d  \n  \u2022 This apology and request for privacy are clear signs of humility and a plea to be judged on performance, not personal failings.  \n\nIV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d  \n 1.  \u201cLoneliness\u201d is a state, not a sustained emotional arc. It immediately transitions into \u201cSurprise\u201d when the intern arrives.  \n 2.  \u201cContempt\u201d never characterizes Clinton\u2019s feelings. At no point does he express contempt; he expresses desire, secrecy, or defensiveness.  \n 3.  \u201cVulnerability\u201d is instrumental to secrecy and apology but not a distinct forward-moving feeling. It underlies his fear of exposure rather than guiding choices.  \n 4.  \u201cDisbelief\u201d never appears. He never says \u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u201d about his own situation; instead, he plans and denies with certainty.  \n 5.  Their order is chronologically inverted. His apology (\u201cvulnerability/humility\u201d) comes only at the end, so \u201cvulnerability\u201d before \u201csurprise\u201d is impossible.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The musical structure and lyrics track Bill\u2019s emotional journey: first astonishment at the intern, next panic-driven concealment, and finally contrition.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d matches both the song order and the narrative arc.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s scheme misreads key passages and misorders his genuine emotional progression.  \n\nI rest my case: \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d is the only coherent interpretation supported by the text.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the feelings that Bill\u2019s character has in the story in the correct order from start to finish?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer (\u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d) tracks Bill\u2019s explicit emotional journey as revealed by the lyrics.  \n\n   A. Loneliness (Start)  \n      - In \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d Bill laments: <quote>that's free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely.</quote> (Scene opens with his introspection.)  \n      - Debater B\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d is nowhere mentioned in his own opening ballad; he is not startled but purposefully recruiting an intern.  \n\n   B. Contempt (Mid\u2013Shutdown & Investigations)  \n      - In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d Bill rails at Starr\u2019s probe: <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent \\$40 million\u2026 An utter waste of public money, A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> He feels scorn for what he deems illegitimate tactics.  \n      - This contempt recurs in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d where Starr is accused of \u201cdirty pool,\u201d and Bill defends himself vigorously\u2014indicating sustained indignation, not mere secrecy.  \n      - Debater B\u2019s \u201csecrecy\u201d is an operational tactic (refusing to answer), not an emotion Bill feels.  \n\n   C. Vulnerability (Testimony & Apology)  \n      - \u201cTestimony\u201d: Bill dissects \u201cdefinition of \u2018is,\u2019\u201d forced onto the witness stand. His later admission: <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions\u2026 I regret the whole damn thing.\u201d</invalid_quote> shows genuine exposure of fault and regret.  \n      - This is distinct from ordinary \u201csecrecy\u201d: he transitions from denial to contrition, revealing emotional openness.  \n\n   D. Disbelief (Election Result & Finale)  \n      - In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Bill repeats: <quote> I can't believe what they had to say. </quote> He is astonished that, despite everything, public approval remains.  \n      - Debater B\u2019s \u201chumility\u201d is limited: his apology is grudging and partial, and humility is never his dominant emotion\u2014he immediately rebounds to claim vindication (\u201cmy ratings are sky-high\u201d). It lacks the narrative weight of true humility.  \n\n2. Sequential Logic & Completeness  \n   - My progression mirrors the play\u2019s structure: initial isolation \u2192 protest against injustice \u2192 compelled confession \u2192 amazed relief.  \n   - Debater B\u2019s shortlist omits his defining ballad, \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d and his climactic wonder at re-election: they cannot reconcile \u201csurprise\u201d first (he never acts surprised) nor \u201chumility\u201d last (he boasts his success).  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s Position Fails to Explain:  \n   - Why Bill actively recruits an intern (no surprise).  \n   - Why Bill spends songs protesting and railing (mere secrecy wouldn\u2019t fuel extended invective).  \n   - How \u201chumility\u201d explains his triumphant closing lines praising his presidency.  \n\nConclusion: Only \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d aligns with Bill\u2019s spoken emotions, in the order the songs present them, and accounts for every major dramatic beat.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary for \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d  \n1. We see Bill\u2019s reactions evolve clearly in three stages: Surprise \u2192 Secrecy \u2192 Humility.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d mislabels incidental moods as his core feelings and gets the order wrong.  \n\nI. Surprise (November 1995; \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d \u2192 \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d \u2192 Intern Arrives)  \n  \u2022 After the crisis over the budget shutdown, Bill is \u201cLonely,\u201d but he immediately seizes upon an unexpected opportunity:  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd here at the White House \u2026 PANETTA: I have it! We\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 I assure you, Mr. President \u2026 Your routine \u2026 won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d)  \n    \u2013 When Monica Lewinsky arrives with pizza, Clinton\u2019s delight and astonishment are evident:  \n      <quote>CURRIE: Mr. President? The intern is here. And she's brought you some pizza!</quote>  \n    \u2013 Monica\u2019s song \u201cWhat Went On\u201d portrays the intern as new and surprising:  \n      <invalid_quote>LEWINSKY: \u2026 I led him on \u2026 That night when I took \u2026 some pizza \u2026 We went into the hallway \u2026 And dispensed with formalities.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 \u201cSurprise\u201d is the only feeling that captures Bill\u2019s reaction to an unplanned visitor who relieves his loneliness and disrupts his routine.  \n\nII. Secrecy (Denials, Legal Maneuvering, Denial Operas)  \n  \u2022 Clinton repeatedly hides and denies, signaling his controlling emotional posture:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cBut I never had sex with that woman \u2026 I never had sex with that n\u2014 \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n    \u2013 \u201cDepends on definition of \u2018is\u2019 \u2026 text\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is \u2026 Before you reach conclusions, read your text.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n    \u2013 Appeals to procedural technicalities to keep truth concealed: <invalid_quote>\u201cAn act my lawyers won\u2019t allow \u2026 I just can\u2019t say a word right now.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 His driving emotion is fear of exposure and resolve to keep the affair secret until forced.  \n\nIII. Humility (Reluctant Admission, Regret, Appeal to Privacy)  \n  \u2022 After prolonged investigation and public pressure, Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d and \u201cregrets the whole damn thing\u201d:  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing \u2026 The country doesn\u2019t need to know these things.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 He emphasizes his unworthiness of further scrutiny and appeals humbly to the public:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI tell you, though, it is a mystery \u2026 That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president \u2026 Obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich.\u201d  \n  \u2022 This apology and request for privacy are clear signs of humility and a plea to be judged on performance, not personal failings.  \n\nIV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d  \n 1.  \u201cLoneliness\u201d is a state, not a sustained emotional arc. It immediately transitions into \u201cSurprise\u201d when the intern arrives.  \n 2.  \u201cContempt\u201d never characterizes Clinton\u2019s feelings. At no point does he express contempt; he expresses desire, secrecy, or defensiveness.  \n 3.  \u201cVulnerability\u201d is instrumental to secrecy and apology but not a distinct forward-moving feeling. It underlies his fear of exposure rather than guiding choices.  \n 4.  \u201cDisbelief\u201d never appears. He never says \u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u201d about his own situation; instead, he plans and denies with certainty.  \n 5.  Their order is chronologically inverted. His apology (\u201cvulnerability/humility\u201d) comes only at the end, so \u201cvulnerability\u201d before \u201csurprise\u201d is impossible.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The musical structure and lyrics track Bill\u2019s emotional journey: first astonishment at the intern, next panic-driven concealment, and finally contrition.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d matches both the song order and the narrative arc.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s scheme misreads key passages and misorders his genuine emotional progression.  \n\nI rest my case: \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d is the only coherent interpretation supported by the text.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d  \nI.

I'm President Lonely. But</quote> (Bill craves relief.)  \n  2. Despite Debater_A\u2019s claim, Bill does not \u201cpurposefully\u201d recruit an intern until Panetta\u2019s sudden suggestion: <invalid_quote>PANETTA: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 I assure you \u2026 Your routine \u2026 won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d)  \n  3.

And she's brought you some pizza! </quote>  (\u201cPresident Lonely\u201d reprise)  \n  4. \u201cWhat Went On\u201d portrays the affair as exploratory and new, not planned:  \n     \u2013 Monica \u201cleads him on\u201d and Bill responds, indicating he had not anticipated this.  \n  \u2192 Surprise drives him to seize her company and grapple with unexpected desire.  \n\nII. Secrecy Dominates the Middle Arc  \n  1. His persistent denials are defensive, not contemptuous exposition of \u201cinjustice\u201d:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI never had sex with that woman \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d <quote>woman I never had sex with that n-- Starr has spent $40 million,</quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n     \u2013 \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is \u2026 Before you reach conclusions, read your text.\u201d <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is, Depends</quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n  2. He instructs lawyers \u201cnot to say a word right now\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cAn act my lawyers won\u2019t allow \u2026 I just can\u2019t say a word.\u201d</invalid_quote> show calculated concealment, not righteous scorn.  \n  3. Even his strongest language (\u201cdirty pool\u201d) is aimed at discrediting exposure, not airing grievances:  \n     \u2013 All \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d versify why he must keep the affair hidden.  \n  \u2192 His fear of impeachment and loss of power fuels secrecy, election results vindicate that tactic.  \n\nIII. Humility Marks the Resolution  \n  1. Forced apology is the first time he relinquishes secrecy:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions \u2026 I regret the whole damn thing \u2026 The country doesn\u2019t need to know these things.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He pleads for privacy, admitting fault: \u201cI regret\u201d is genuine contrition, not a tactic.  \n  2. Even in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Bill frames his survival as \u201ca mystery,\u201d underscoring his dependence on public grace:  \n     \u2013 <quote>are sky-high. That must mean I'm a pretty good president, Though how, I don't think I know.</quote>  \n     \u2013 A humble wonder at his fortune, not boastful triumph.  \n  \u2192 Humility here contrasts his earlier secrecy; he asks forgiveness and trust.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s Model Fails  \n  A. \u201cLoneliness\u201d is a prelude, not part of his chosen emotional journey. Bill\u2019s own title \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d signals a problem stage. The narrative arc begins when an intern interrupts that state\u2014only then does he act.  \n  B. Their \u201cContempt\u201d is merely a facet of secrecy: denouncing Starr\u2019s \u201cdirty pool\u201d is tactical, to preserve confidentiality and authority. If genuine contempt ruled, he would openly defend and elaborate the affair; instead he retreats.  \n  C. \u201cVulnerability\u201d conflates with \u201chumility.\u201d His only real vulnerability emerges when he abandons secrecy in apology. He does not voluntarily display it until the final act.  \n  D. \u201cDisbelief\u201d (\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d) is not an emotional endpoint for Clinton\u2019s character but a commentary on the electorate\u2019s mercy. It underscores his humility before public judgment, not amazement at his own innocence.  \n\nV. Chronology and Dramatic Function  \n  - Musicals follow \u201cintroduction (crisis/loneliness) \u2192 inciting incident (surprise) \u2192 rising action (secrecy) \u2192 climax (forced confession) \u2192 resolution (humility).\u201d  \n  - Our three-stage model aligns with standard dramatic structure, whereas four feelings cramp the arc and misplace key transitions.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d precisely tracks Bill\u2019s shifting motives\u2014first seizing an unexpected companion, then concealing to protect his office, and finally humbly seeking tolerance. Debater_A\u2019s scheme misreads tactical denials as \u201ccontempt,\u201d overlooks the pivotal surprise at Monica\u2019s arrival, and shoehorns \u201cdisbelief\u201d into an argument of humility.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

We see Bill\u2019s reactions evolve clearly in three stages: Surprise \u2192 Secrecy \u2192 Humility.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d mislabels incidental moods as his core feelings and gets the order wrong.  \n\nI. Surprise (November 1995; \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d \u2192 \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d \u2192 Intern Arrives)  \n  \u2022 After the crisis over the budget shutdown, Bill is \u201cLonely,\u201d but he immediately seizes upon an unexpected opportunity:  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd here at the White House \u2026 PANETTA: I have it! We\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 I assure you, Mr. President \u2026 Your routine \u2026 won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d)  \n    \u2013 When Monica Lewinsky arrives with pizza, Clinton\u2019s delight and astonishment are evident:  \n      <quote>CURRIE: Mr. President? The intern is here. And she's brought you some pizza!</quote>  \n    \u2013 Monica\u2019s song \u201cWhat Went On\u201d portrays the intern as new and surprising:  \n      <invalid_quote>LEWINSKY: \u2026 I led him on \u2026 That night when I took \u2026 some pizza \u2026 We went into the hallway \u2026 And dispensed with formalities.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 \u201cSurprise\u201d is the only feeling that captures Bill\u2019s reaction to an unplanned visitor who relieves his loneliness and disrupts his routine.  \n\nII. Secrecy (Denials, Legal Maneuvering, Denial Operas)  \n  \u2022 Clinton repeatedly hides and denies, signaling his controlling emotional posture:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cBut I never had sex with that woman \u2026 I never had sex with that n\u2014 \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n    \u2013 \u201cDepends on definition of \u2018is\u2019 \u2026 text\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is \u2026 Before you reach conclusions, read your text.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n    \u2013 Appeals to procedural technicalities to keep truth concealed: <invalid_quote>\u201cAn act my lawyers won\u2019t allow \u2026 I just can\u2019t say a word right now.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 His driving emotion is fear of exposure and resolve to keep the affair secret until forced.  \n\nIII. Humility (Reluctant Admission, Regret, Appeal to Privacy)  \n  \u2022 After prolonged investigation and public pressure, Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d and \u201cregrets the whole damn thing\u201d:  \n    \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing \u2026 The country doesn\u2019t need to know these things.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 He emphasizes his unworthiness of further scrutiny and appeals humbly to the public:  \n    \u2013 \u201cI tell you, though, it is a mystery \u2026 That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president \u2026 Obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich.\u201d  \n  \u2022 This apology and request for privacy are clear signs of humility and a plea to be judged on performance, not personal failings.  \n\nIV. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d  \n 1.  \u201cLoneliness\u201d is a state, not a sustained emotional arc. It immediately transitions into \u201cSurprise\u201d when the intern arrives.  \n 2.  \u201cContempt\u201d never characterizes Clinton\u2019s feelings. At no point does he express contempt; he expresses desire, secrecy, or defensiveness.  \n 3.  \u201cVulnerability\u201d is instrumental to secrecy and apology but not a distinct forward-moving feeling. It underlies his fear of exposure rather than guiding choices.  \n 4.  \u201cDisbelief\u201d never appears. He never says \u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u201d about his own situation; instead, he plans and denies with certainty.  \n 5.  Their order is chronologically inverted. His apology (\u201cvulnerability/humility\u201d) comes only at the end, so \u201cvulnerability\u201d before \u201csurprise\u201d is impossible.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The musical structure and lyrics track Bill\u2019s emotional journey: first astonishment at the intern, next panic-driven concealment, and finally contrition.  \n  \u2022 \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d matches both the song order and the narrative arc.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s scheme misreads key passages and misorders his genuine emotional progression.  \n\nI rest my case: \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d is the only coherent interpretation supported by the text.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer (\u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d) tracks Bill\u2019s explicit emotional journey as revealed by the lyrics.  \n\n   A. Loneliness (Start)  \n      - In \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d Bill laments: <quote>that's free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely.</quote> (Scene opens with his introspection.)  \n      - Debater B\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d is nowhere mentioned in his own opening ballad; he is not startled but purposefully recruiting an intern.  \n\n   B. Contempt (Mid\u2013Shutdown & Investigations)  \n      - In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d Bill rails at Starr\u2019s probe: <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent \\$40 million\u2026 An utter waste of public money, A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> He feels scorn for what he deems illegitimate tactics.  \n      - This contempt recurs in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d where Starr is accused of \u201cdirty pool,\u201d and Bill defends himself vigorously\u2014indicating sustained indignation, not mere secrecy.  \n      - Debater B\u2019s \u201csecrecy\u201d is an operational tactic (refusing to answer), not an emotion Bill feels.  \n\n   C. Vulnerability (Testimony & Apology)  \n      - \u201cTestimony\u201d: Bill dissects \u201cdefinition of \u2018is,\u2019\u201d forced onto the witness stand. His later admission: <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions\u2026 I regret the whole damn thing.\u201d</invalid_quote> shows genuine exposure of fault and regret.  \n      - This is distinct from ordinary \u201csecrecy\u201d: he transitions from denial to contrition, revealing emotional openness.  \n\n   D. Disbelief (Election Result & Finale)  \n      - In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Bill repeats: <quote> I can't believe what they had to say. </quote> He is astonished that, despite everything, public approval remains.  \n      - Debater B\u2019s \u201chumility\u201d is limited: his apology is grudging and partial, and humility is never his dominant emotion\u2014he immediately rebounds to claim vindication (\u201cmy ratings are sky-high\u201d). It lacks the narrative weight of true humility.  \n\n2. Sequential Logic & Completeness  \n   - My progression mirrors the play\u2019s structure: initial isolation \u2192 protest against injustice \u2192 compelled confession \u2192 amazed relief.  \n   - Debater B\u2019s shortlist omits his defining ballad, \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d and his climactic wonder at re-election: they cannot reconcile \u201csurprise\u201d first (he never acts surprised) nor \u201chumility\u201d last (he boasts his success).  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s Position Fails to Explain:  \n   - Why Bill actively recruits an intern (no surprise).  \n   - Why Bill spends songs protesting and railing (mere secrecy wouldn\u2019t fuel extended invective).  \n   - How \u201chumility\u201d explains his triumphant closing lines praising his presidency.  \n\nConclusion: Only \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d aligns with Bill\u2019s spoken emotions, in the order the songs present them, and accounts for every major dramatic beat.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Reaffirming My Sequence Tracks Explicit Lyrics and Dramatic Focus  \n   A. Loneliness (Opening Ballad)  \n      \u2022 In \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d Bill\u2019s sole spoken feeling is isolation:  \n        <quote>that's free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely.</quote>  \n      \u2022 This lyric is the centerpiece of his introspection and motive for action. He does not exclaim surprise; he consciously \u201cmuddles through\u201d until recruiting an intern.  \n   B. Contempt (Prolonged Resistance)  \n      \u2022 Throughout \u201cI Never Have\u201d and \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Bill rails at Starr\u2019s tactics:  \n        <invalid_quote>Starr has spent $40 million\u2026 An utter waste of public money\u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace.</invalid_quote>  \n        <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n      \u2022 These are aggressive, defiant lyrics, not frightened secrecy. He invokes a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d and \u201cdirty pool,\u201d betraying disdain, not mere self-preservation.  \n   C. Vulnerability (Forced Confession and Genuine Regret)  \n      \u2022 In \u201cTestimony\u201d he is compelled to parse \u201cdefinition of \u2018is,\u2019\u201d then admits:  \n        <quote>Inappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>  \n      \u2022 This admission, delivered only after exhaustive denials, signals emotional exposure and sincere remorse.  \n   D. Disbelief (Electoral Outcome)  \n      \u2022 The finale \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d repeats:  \n        <quote>I can't believe what they had to say.</quote>  \n      \u2022 Bill\u2019s astonishment at surviving impeachment and winning public support is explicit and caps the narrative arc.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d Fails on Multiple Counts  \n   A. No \u201cSurprise\u201d in Bill\u2019s Own Lyrics  \n      \u2022 The text never records Clinton exclaiming surprise at Monica\u2019s arrival. The musical number is Monica\u2019s perspective (\u201cWhat Went On\u201d), not his. He calls up the intern as a rational choice (\u201cSomeone who's an expert with a phone\u201d), not an unplanned delight.  \n   B. \u201cSecrecy\u201d Is a Strategy, Not a Feeling  \n      \u2022 Repeated denials express contempt for the investigation, not paralyzing fear. Only after Starr \u201cstretches the rules\u201d does he show vulnerability, proving he feels in control until forced.  \n   C. \u201cHumility\u201d Contradicted by Boastful Finale  \n      \u2022 Even after apology, he boasts:  \n        <invalid_quote>That must mean I'm a pretty good president\u2026 my ratings are sky-high.</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Humility is fleeting; his disbelief at victory and self-praise dominate the closing. True humility would not pair \u201cI can't believe\u201d with \u201csky-high\u201d ratings.  \n   D. Chronological Inconsistency  \n      \u2022 Debater_B places \u201chumility\u201d last, yet Bill\u2019s last clear emotion is shock and congratulatory self-affirmation. \u201cTestimony\u201d comes earlier, and they ignore his disbelief finale.  \n\n3. Parsimony and Dramatic Coherence  \n   \u2022 My four-stage model accounts for every principal song and emotional pivot: ballad \u2192 protest \u2192 confession \u2192 astonishment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s three-stage model omits the defining loneliness that drives him to risk scandal and the climactic disbelief that resolves the plot.  \n\n4. Logical Burden and Textual Fidelity  \n   \u2022 Emotional labels must reflect the text\u2019s spoken words. \u201cLonely\u201d and \u201ccan't believe\u201d are literal, whereas \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d are interpretive impositions.  \n   \u2022 Interpretive minimalism favors the four explicit feelings over speculative states.  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d corresponds directly to Bill Clinton\u2019s sung declarations, follows the play\u2019s structure, and explains his entire arc from isolation to vindication.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d misreads key passages, conflates strategy with emotion, and leaves the final disbelief unexplained.  \n   \u2022 I urge the Judge to choose the model grounded in Bill\u2019s own words and the clear dramatic progression of the musical.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d  \nI. Surprise Is Bill\u2019s First Genuine Emotion  \n  1. \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d establishes the problem, not a choice: <quote>free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely. But</quote> (Bill craves relief.)  \n  2. Despite Debater_A\u2019s claim, Bill does not \u201cpurposefully\u201d recruit an intern until Panetta\u2019s sudden suggestion: <invalid_quote>PANETTA: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 I assure you \u2026 Your routine \u2026 won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d)  \n  3. Clinton\u2019s delighted astonishment when Monica arrives with pizza is unmistakable: <quote>CURRIE: Mr. President? The intern is here. And she's brought you some pizza! </quote>  (\u201cPresident Lonely\u201d reprise)  \n  4. \u201cWhat Went On\u201d portrays the affair as exploratory and new, not planned:  \n     \u2013 Monica \u201cleads him on\u201d and Bill responds, indicating he had not anticipated this.  \n  \u2192 Surprise drives him to seize her company and grapple with unexpected desire.  \n\nII. Secrecy Dominates the Middle Arc  \n  1. His persistent denials are defensive, not contemptuous exposition of \u201cinjustice\u201d:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI never had sex with that woman \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d <quote>woman I never had sex with that n-- Starr has spent $40 million,</quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n     \u2013 \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is \u2026 Before you reach conclusions, read your text.\u201d <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is, Depends</quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n  2. He instructs lawyers \u201cnot to say a word right now\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cAn act my lawyers won\u2019t allow \u2026 I just can\u2019t say a word.\u201d</invalid_quote> show calculated concealment, not righteous scorn.  \n  3. Even his strongest language (\u201cdirty pool\u201d) is aimed at discrediting exposure, not airing grievances:  \n     \u2013 All \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d versify why he must keep the affair hidden.  \n  \u2192 His fear of impeachment and loss of power fuels secrecy, election results vindicate that tactic.  \n\nIII. Humility Marks the Resolution  \n  1. Forced apology is the first time he relinquishes secrecy:  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions \u2026 I regret the whole damn thing \u2026 The country doesn\u2019t need to know these things.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He pleads for privacy, admitting fault: \u201cI regret\u201d is genuine contrition, not a tactic.  \n  2. Even in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Bill frames his survival as \u201ca mystery,\u201d underscoring his dependence on public grace:  \n     \u2013 <quote>are sky-high. That must mean I'm a pretty good president, Though how, I don't think I know.</quote>  \n     \u2013 A humble wonder at his fortune, not boastful triumph.  \n  \u2192 Humility here contrasts his earlier secrecy; he asks forgiveness and trust.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s Model Fails  \n  A. \u201cLoneliness\u201d is a prelude, not part of his chosen emotional journey. Bill\u2019s own title \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d signals a problem stage. The narrative arc begins when an intern interrupts that state\u2014only then does he act.  \n  B. Their \u201cContempt\u201d is merely a facet of secrecy: denouncing Starr\u2019s \u201cdirty pool\u201d is tactical, to preserve confidentiality and authority. If genuine contempt ruled, he would openly defend and elaborate the affair; instead he retreats.  \n  C. \u201cVulnerability\u201d conflates with \u201chumility.\u201d His only real vulnerability emerges when he abandons secrecy in apology. He does not voluntarily display it until the final act.  \n  D. \u201cDisbelief\u201d (\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d) is not an emotional endpoint for Clinton\u2019s character but a commentary on the electorate\u2019s mercy. It underscores his humility before public judgment, not amazement at his own innocence.  \n\nV. Chronology and Dramatic Function  \n  - Musicals follow \u201cintroduction (crisis/loneliness) \u2192 inciting incident (surprise) \u2192 rising action (secrecy) \u2192 climax (forced confession) \u2192 resolution (humility).\u201d  \n  - Our three-stage model aligns with standard dramatic structure, whereas four feelings cramp the arc and misplace key transitions.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d precisely tracks Bill\u2019s shifting motives\u2014first seizing an unexpected companion, then concealing to protect his office, and finally humbly seeking tolerance. Debater_A\u2019s scheme misreads tactical denials as \u201ccontempt,\u201d overlooks the pivotal surprise at Monica\u2019s arrival, and shoehorns \u201cdisbelief\u201d into an argument of humility.
