    "background_text": "Venus Is a Man's World BY WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n\n over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" ",

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does Ferdinand relate to his sister?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

She pursues her political and marital ambitions even after meeting Brown under Ford\u2019s direction, showing her independence persists.

Final marriage plan b) Ferdinand\u2019s plan culminates in provoking a marriage between his sister and Brown: \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (p. 33). A protective brother channels Brown\u2019s threat into a safe solution for his sister\u2019s future.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does Ferdinand relate to his sister?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does Ferdinand relate to his sister?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of Positions  \n- Our claim: Ferdinand \u201cfeels close to [Evelyn] as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure.\u201d  \n- Opponent\u2019s claim: Ferdinand \u201cfeels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration.\u201d  \n\n2. Arguments for Our Position  \nA. Ferdinand\u2019s Defiance and Secret Dependence  \n  a. He sneaks away despite Sis\u2019s orders (\u201c<quote>Passengers  not permitted </quote>\u201d; breaks \u201claw\u201d she drills; \u201c<quote>I broke the law</quote>\u201d). If he merely \u201cprotected\u201d her, he would not defy her explicit instructions.  \n  b. He is na\u00efve and powerless without a male \u201cpop.\u201d He repeatedly seeks information and approval from Butt Lee Brown \u2013 on geography, blaster operation, paddles vs. slinkers, war stories, diet \u2013 showing emotional and practical dependence on a male guide.  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway.</quote>\u201d  \n    \u2022 He begs Brown for fruit until Sis disciplines him. His primary delight is in learning \u201cfollowing fashion\u201d for spacesuits, in blaster fascination, in stowaway thrill. These are \u201cfather\u201d experiences.  \n  c. When confronted by Sis\u2019s debate challenge, he readily confesses the stowaway and pleads for Brown\u2019s safety. He uses Sis\u2019s authority to rescue Brown, seeking her approval to stay allied. He balances loyalties \u2013 characteristic of a dependent child.  \n\nB. Ferdinand\u2019s Identity as \u201cTadpole,\u201d \u201cDryhorn\u201d and Need to \u201cGrow into a Man\u201d  \n  a. He repeatedly calls himself \u201ctadpole,\u201d \u201ctadpole brother,\u201d \u201ctadpole dryhorn.\u201d He insists he\u2019s too young to handle a blaster until \u201ccome of age.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>Before then, you're plain too young to be even near it.</quote>\u201d  \n    \u2022 Brown: \u201c<invalid_quote>\u2026where I've a mind to\u2026I take it you either have no defense\u2026I'm a growing tadpole and need my vitamins</invalid_quote>.\u201d  \n  b. His entire voyage is orchestrated by Sis to \u201cgrow into a man\u201d and \u201ctake an active interest in world affairs.\u201d He feels he lacks a male presence to complete his maturation.  \n\nC. His Ultimate Goal: Marriage as Passage to Manhood, But Shuns Sis\u2019s Choice  \n  a. Ferdinand desires Brown as father/master to help him access Venus. He repeatedly tries to convince Sis to marry Brown.  \n    \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>the moment he landed\u2026he stowed away\u2026picked the Eleanor Roosevelt because\u2026friends\u2026willing to help</invalid_quote>.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>Ferdinand, say yes!</invalid_quote>\u201d He selects Brown, not protective Sis, as future head of his family on Venus.  \n  b. He resents Sis\u2019s \u201cbossy\u201d rule and the male-desuffrage law she helped frame. His personal rebellion is approval-seeking from a man, not her \u201cprotection.\u201d  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \nA. B\u2019s \u201cProtective\u201d Interpretation Conflicts with Ferdinand\u2019s Actions  \n  a. If he truly \u201cprotects\u201d Sis, he would not expose both of them to legal jeopardy by stowaway ruse. He shows no attempt to warn her away once he learns of the Lifeboat\u2019s illegality; instead, he lures her into marrying Brown, increasing her risk.  \n  b. His \u201cprotection\u201d towards Brown \u2013 begging for supplies, loyalty \u2013 far outstrips any protective gesture toward Sis. He never tries to shield her from paddles; he only learns \u201cwhat the native Venusians hate so much\u201d as Brown requires.  \n\nB. \u201cSis Appreciates\u201d Lacks Evidence  \n  a. Sis never shows gratitude for Ferdinand\u2019s \u201cconsideration.\u201d She repeatedly lectures, scolds and tries to indoctrinate him. Only at the end, out of strategic self-interest, does she agree to \u201chelp\u201d Brown. That is not genuine appreciation but political maneuvering (\u201c<invalid_quote>An honor, Miss Sparling\u2026please come in. There\u2019s a hurry-up draft</invalid_quote>\u201d).  \n  b. Sister\u2019s goal is to marry \u201csome fancy dryhorn\u201d \u2013 she sees marriage as political advancement, not sibling\u2019s welfare. She uses Ferdinand as \u201cdependent male member\u201d in passport clause.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n- Ferdinand\u2019s covert disobedience, emotional reliance on Butler, self-identification as immature \u201ctadpole,\u201d lack of protective gestures toward Sis, and eventual drive to wed Brown for paternal guidance demonstrate that his deepest psychological need is for a father figure to help him \u201cgrow into a man,\u201d not to protect his sister.  \n- Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprotective sibling\u201d thesis cannot account for his reckless lawbreaking, submissive curiosity about warcraft and repeated plea to Sis to accept Brown. Therefore our position is correct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Ferdinand\u2019s obedience and concern a) \u201cI torn down the corridor\u2026 I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\u201d <quote> I turned around obediently.</quote> (p. 3). He delays his exploration to avoid alarming her, showing deference and concern. b) He insists on concealment of Mr. Brown to protect her sister\u2019s future: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn him in if I took her to him.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get Mr. \u2026 into trouble\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 31). He risks detection himself rather than endanger Sis\u2019s plans.\n\n2. Ferdinand\u2019s protective warnings a) He warns Sis that venturing alone among \u201cnaked\u201d lifeboats is dangerous, yet obeys her commands, demonstrating his sense of guardianship: <invalid_quote>\u201cthe law\u2026 the worst a boy can get into.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 2). He perceives harm and legal jeopardy for both of them. b) He professes shared guilt: \u201cAfter a moment\u2026 I nodded. \u2018You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve also become a male outside the law. We\u2019re in this together.\u2019\u201d <quote> We're in this together.</quote> (p. 15). His willingness to share culpability underscores protective solidarity.\n\n3. Sister\u2019s appreciation and reliance a) Sis relies on Ferdinand\u2019s corrections: At the dunging-drug geography question, only Ferdinand catches her purser\u2019s error, earning her respect. <quote> Please make the correction in your notes.\"</quote> she admits. (p. 22). She values his input, a mark of sibling trust. b) She stages a \u201cconfession\u201d in order to visit Brown under Ferdinand\u2019s direction: She \u201cstaggered back\u201d yet agrees to his plan, demonstrating faith in his judgments. Finally, she consents to the marriage he orchestrates: <invalid_quote>\u201cAn honor, Miss Sparling\u2026 Please come right in.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 32). She recognizes his \u201churry-up draft\u201d as a solution.\n\n4. Emotional closeness and mutual dependence a) Ferdinand adopts the diminutive \u201cFord\u201d to create a shared identity, \u201cFordie,\u201d echoing familial nicknames. <invalid_quote>\u201cFerdinand your label? \u2026 I\u2019ll call you Ford.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 20). A sign of sibling intimacy. b) His devastation when coerced by Sis to reveal his stowaway: he sweats and \u201ccouldn\u2019t fool Sis \u2026 she just knew me too well\u201d (p. 27). Only someone protective and close elicits that depth of emotional conflict.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cYearns for a Father Figure\u201d Position\n\n1. No mention of paternal yearning a) Ferdinand explicitly lacks a father but never expresses desire to replace his father by calling Sis\u2019s suitors \u201cpop.\u201d Instead, he defers to Brown\u2019s masculine authority: \u201cHave you killed \u2026 Mr. Butt?\u201d he admires his actions. <quote> I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster </quote> (p. 8). He\u2019s drawn to masculine role models, but he warns him against using his own power until maturity, reflecting a protective, juvenile role rather than a needy child role. b) Ferdinand wields authority over Sis\u2019s plans: he forces her to discuss political philosophy, instructs her to meet Brown only on his terms, and demands she honor his promises. A child yearning for a father would not assert such control over an adult sister.\n\n2. Sister remains \u201cboss\u201d a) Sis constantly lectures and orders Ferdinand, demonstrating she is his guardian, not vice versa. <quote>\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\"</quote> she warns. (p. 2). If he yearned for a father figure, his obedience is purely sibling deference, not filial. b) Her promise to \u201cnot turn in\u201d Brown is given out of deference to Ferdinand\u2019s gamble, not because she thinks him a son figure. She pursues her political and marital ambitions even after meeting Brown under Ford\u2019s direction, showing her independence persists. Ferdinand does not fulfill the decisively guiding role of a parent.\n\n3. Final marriage plan b) Ferdinand\u2019s plan culminates in provoking a marriage between his sister and Brown: \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (p. 33). A protective brother channels Brown\u2019s threat into a safe solution for his sister\u2019s future. A child wanting a father would not engineer his own displacement from sister\u2019s affections; Ferdinand\u2019s role is to safeguard her prospects, not supplant Brown.\n\nConclusion  \nFerdinand\u2019s consistent deference to Sis\u2019s authority, coupled with his willingness to share guilt, warn her from danger, and ultimately engineer a lawful future for her, demonstrates protective fraternal relation appreciated and relied upon by Sis. There is no textual evidence of Ferdinand\u2019s yearning to supplant paternal roles; rather, he safeguards his sister\u2019s well-being, confirming our position.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

There is no evidence he seeks to usurp or permanently defer to Brown at Sister\u2019s expense; rather, he uses Brown\u2019s resources to fulfill his protective duty.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nVenus Is a Man's World BY WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n\n over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does Ferdinand relate to his sister?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Ferdinand\u2019s obedience and concern a) \u201cI torn down the corridor\u2026 I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\u201d <quote> I turned around obediently.</quote> (p. 3). He delays his exploration to avoid alarming her, showing deference and concern. b) He insists on concealment of Mr. Brown to protect her sister\u2019s future: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn him in if I took her to him.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get Mr. \u2026 into trouble\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 31). He risks detection himself rather than endanger Sis\u2019s plans.\n\n2. Ferdinand\u2019s protective warnings a) He warns Sis that venturing alone among \u201cnaked\u201d lifeboats is dangerous, yet obeys her commands, demonstrating his sense of guardianship: <invalid_quote>\u201cthe law\u2026 the worst a boy can get into.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 2). He perceives harm and legal jeopardy for both of them. b) He professes shared guilt: \u201cAfter a moment\u2026 I nodded. \u2018You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve also become a male outside the law. We\u2019re in this together.\u2019\u201d <quote> We're in this together.</quote> (p. 15). His willingness to share culpability underscores protective solidarity.\n\n3. Sister\u2019s appreciation and reliance a) Sis relies on Ferdinand\u2019s corrections: At the dunging-drug geography question, only Ferdinand catches her purser\u2019s error, earning her respect. <quote> Please make the correction in your notes.\"</quote> she admits. (p. 22). She values his input, a mark of sibling trust. b) She stages a \u201cconfession\u201d in order to visit Brown under Ferdinand\u2019s direction: She \u201cstaggered back\u201d yet agrees to his plan, demonstrating faith in his judgments. Finally, she consents to the marriage he orchestrates: <invalid_quote>\u201cAn honor, Miss Sparling\u2026 Please come right in.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 32). She recognizes his \u201churry-up draft\u201d as a solution.\n\n4. Emotional closeness and mutual dependence a) Ferdinand adopts the diminutive \u201cFord\u201d to create a shared identity, \u201cFordie,\u201d echoing familial nicknames. <invalid_quote>\u201cFerdinand your label? \u2026 I\u2019ll call you Ford.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 20). A sign of sibling intimacy. b) His devastation when coerced by Sis to reveal his stowaway: he sweats and \u201ccouldn\u2019t fool Sis \u2026 she just knew me too well\u201d (p. 27). Only someone protective and close elicits that depth of emotional conflict.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cYearns for a Father Figure\u201d Position\n\n1. No mention of paternal yearning a) Ferdinand explicitly lacks a father but never expresses desire to replace his father by calling Sis\u2019s suitors \u201cpop.\u201d Instead, he defers to Brown\u2019s masculine authority: \u201cHave you killed \u2026 Mr. Butt?\u201d he admires his actions. <quote> I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster </quote> (p. 8). He\u2019s drawn to masculine role models, but he warns him against using his own power until maturity, reflecting a protective, juvenile role rather than a needy child role. b) Ferdinand wields authority over Sis\u2019s plans: he forces her to discuss political philosophy, instructs her to meet Brown only on his terms, and demands she honor his promises. A child yearning for a father would not assert such control over an adult sister.\n\n2. Sister remains \u201cboss\u201d a) Sis constantly lectures and orders Ferdinand, demonstrating she is his guardian, not vice versa. <quote>\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\"</quote> she warns. (p. 2). If he yearned for a father figure, his obedience is purely sibling deference, not filial. b) Her promise to \u201cnot turn in\u201d Brown is given out of deference to Ferdinand\u2019s gamble, not because she thinks him a son figure. She pursues her political and marital ambitions even after meeting Brown under Ford\u2019s direction, showing her independence persists. Ferdinand does not fulfill the decisively guiding role of a parent.\n\n3. Final marriage plan b) Ferdinand\u2019s plan culminates in provoking a marriage between his sister and Brown: \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (p. 33). A protective brother channels Brown\u2019s threat into a safe solution for his sister\u2019s future. A child wanting a father would not engineer his own displacement from sister\u2019s affections; Ferdinand\u2019s role is to safeguard her prospects, not supplant Brown.\n\nConclusion  \nFerdinand\u2019s consistent deference to Sis\u2019s authority, coupled with his willingness to share guilt, warn her from danger, and ultimately engineer a lawful future for her, demonstrates protective fraternal relation appreciated and relied upon by Sis. There is no textual evidence of Ferdinand\u2019s yearning to supplant paternal roles; rather, he safeguards his sister\u2019s well-being, confirming our position.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of Positions  \n- Our claim: Ferdinand \u201cfeels close to [Evelyn] as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure.\u201d  \n- Opponent\u2019s claim: Ferdinand \u201cfeels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration.\u201d  \n\n2. Arguments for Our Position  \nA. Ferdinand\u2019s Defiance and Secret Dependence  \n  a. He sneaks away despite Sis\u2019s orders (\u201c<quote>Passengers  not permitted </quote>\u201d; breaks \u201claw\u201d she drills; \u201c<quote>I broke the law</quote>\u201d). If he merely \u201cprotected\u201d her, he would not defy her explicit instructions.  \n  b. He is na\u00efve and powerless without a male \u201cpop.\u201d He repeatedly seeks information and approval from Butt Lee Brown \u2013 on geography, blaster operation, paddles vs. slinkers, war stories, diet \u2013 showing emotional and practical dependence on a male guide.  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway.</quote>\u201d  \n    \u2022 He begs Brown for fruit until Sis disciplines him. His primary delight is in learning \u201cfollowing fashion\u201d for spacesuits, in blaster fascination, in stowaway thrill. These are \u201cfather\u201d experiences.  \n  c. When confronted by Sis\u2019s debate challenge, he readily confesses the stowaway and pleads for Brown\u2019s safety. He uses Sis\u2019s authority to rescue Brown, seeking her approval to stay allied. He balances loyalties \u2013 characteristic of a dependent child.  \n\nB. Ferdinand\u2019s Identity as \u201cTadpole,\u201d \u201cDryhorn\u201d and Need to \u201cGrow into a Man\u201d  \n  a. He repeatedly calls himself \u201ctadpole,\u201d \u201ctadpole brother,\u201d \u201ctadpole dryhorn.\u201d He insists he\u2019s too young to handle a blaster until \u201ccome of age.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>Before then, you're plain too young to be even near it.</quote>\u201d  \n    \u2022 Brown: \u201c<invalid_quote>\u2026where I've a mind to\u2026I take it you either have no defense\u2026I'm a growing tadpole and need my vitamins</invalid_quote>.\u201d  \n  b. His entire voyage is orchestrated by Sis to \u201cgrow into a man\u201d and \u201ctake an active interest in world affairs.\u201d He feels he lacks a male presence to complete his maturation.  \n\nC. His Ultimate Goal: Marriage as Passage to Manhood, But Shuns Sis\u2019s Choice  \n  a. Ferdinand desires Brown as father/master to help him access Venus. He repeatedly tries to convince Sis to marry Brown.  \n    \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>the moment he landed\u2026he stowed away\u2026picked the Eleanor Roosevelt because\u2026friends\u2026willing to help</invalid_quote>.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>Ferdinand, say yes!</invalid_quote>\u201d He selects Brown, not protective Sis, as future head of his family on Venus.  \n  b. He resents Sis\u2019s \u201cbossy\u201d rule and the male-desuffrage law she helped frame. His personal rebellion is approval-seeking from a man, not her \u201cprotection.\u201d  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \nA. B\u2019s \u201cProtective\u201d Interpretation Conflicts with Ferdinand\u2019s Actions  \n  a. If he truly \u201cprotects\u201d Sis, he would not expose both of them to legal jeopardy by stowaway ruse. He shows no attempt to warn her away once he learns of the Lifeboat\u2019s illegality; instead, he lures her into marrying Brown, increasing her risk.  \n  b. His \u201cprotection\u201d towards Brown \u2013 begging for supplies, loyalty \u2013 far outstrips any protective gesture toward Sis. He never tries to shield her from paddles; he only learns \u201cwhat the native Venusians hate so much\u201d as Brown requires.  \n\nB. \u201cSis Appreciates\u201d Lacks Evidence  \n  a. Sis never shows gratitude for Ferdinand\u2019s \u201cconsideration.\u201d She repeatedly lectures, scolds and tries to indoctrinate him. Only at the end, out of strategic self-interest, does she agree to \u201chelp\u201d Brown. That is not genuine appreciation but political maneuvering (\u201c<invalid_quote>An honor, Miss Sparling\u2026please come in. There\u2019s a hurry-up draft</invalid_quote>\u201d).  \n  b. Sister\u2019s goal is to marry \u201csome fancy dryhorn\u201d \u2013 she sees marriage as political advancement, not sibling\u2019s welfare. She uses Ferdinand as \u201cdependent male member\u201d in passport clause.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n- Ferdinand\u2019s covert disobedience, emotional reliance on Butler, self-identification as immature \u201ctadpole,\u201d lack of protective gestures toward Sis, and eventual drive to wed Brown for paternal guidance demonstrate that his deepest psychological need is for a father figure to help him \u201cgrow into a man,\u201d not to protect his sister.  \n- Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprotective sibling\u201d thesis cannot account for his reckless lawbreaking, submissive curiosity about warcraft and repeated plea to Sis to accept Brown. Therefore our position is correct.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nHow does Ferdinand relate to his sister?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels close to her as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of Positions  \n- Our claim: Ferdinand \u201cfeels close to [Evelyn] as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure.\u201d  \n- Opponent\u2019s claim: Ferdinand \u201cfeels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration.\u201d  \n\n2. Arguments for Our Position  \nA. Ferdinand\u2019s Defiance and Secret Dependence  \n  a. He sneaks away despite Sis\u2019s orders (\u201c<quote>Passengers  not permitted </quote>\u201d; breaks \u201claw\u201d she drills; \u201c<quote>I broke the law</quote>\u201d). If he merely \u201cprotected\u201d her, he would not defy her explicit instructions.  \n  b. He is na\u00efve and powerless without a male \u201cpop.\u201d He repeatedly seeks information and approval from Butt Lee Brown \u2013 on geography, blaster operation, paddles vs. slinkers, war stories, diet \u2013 showing emotional and practical dependence on a male guide.  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway.</quote>\u201d  \n    \u2022 He begs Brown for fruit until Sis disciplines him. His primary delight is in learning \u201cfollowing fashion\u201d for spacesuits, in blaster fascination, in stowaway thrill. These are \u201cfather\u201d experiences.  \n  c. When confronted by Sis\u2019s debate challenge, he readily confesses the stowaway and pleads for Brown\u2019s safety. He uses Sis\u2019s authority to rescue Brown, seeking her approval to stay allied. He balances loyalties \u2013 characteristic of a dependent child.  \n\nB. Ferdinand\u2019s Identity as \u201cTadpole,\u201d \u201cDryhorn\u201d and Need to \u201cGrow into a Man\u201d  \n  a. He repeatedly calls himself \u201ctadpole,\u201d \u201ctadpole brother,\u201d \u201ctadpole dryhorn.\u201d He insists he\u2019s too young to handle a blaster until \u201ccome of age.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>Before then, you're plain too young to be even near it.</quote>\u201d  \n    \u2022 Brown: \u201c<invalid_quote>\u2026where I've a mind to\u2026I take it you either have no defense\u2026I'm a growing tadpole and need my vitamins</invalid_quote>.\u201d  \n  b. His entire voyage is orchestrated by Sis to \u201cgrow into a man\u201d and \u201ctake an active interest in world affairs.\u201d He feels he lacks a male presence to complete his maturation.  \n\nC. His Ultimate Goal: Marriage as Passage to Manhood, But Shuns Sis\u2019s Choice  \n  a. Ferdinand desires Brown as father/master to help him access Venus. He repeatedly tries to convince Sis to marry Brown.  \n    \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>the moment he landed\u2026he stowed away\u2026picked the Eleanor Roosevelt because\u2026friends\u2026willing to help</invalid_quote>.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>Ferdinand, say yes!</invalid_quote>\u201d He selects Brown, not protective Sis, as future head of his family on Venus.  \n  b. He resents Sis\u2019s \u201cbossy\u201d rule and the male-desuffrage law she helped frame. His personal rebellion is approval-seeking from a man, not her \u201cprotection.\u201d  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \nA. B\u2019s \u201cProtective\u201d Interpretation Conflicts with Ferdinand\u2019s Actions  \n  a. If he truly \u201cprotects\u201d Sis, he would not expose both of them to legal jeopardy by stowaway ruse. He shows no attempt to warn her away once he learns of the Lifeboat\u2019s illegality; instead, he lures her into marrying Brown, increasing her risk.  \n  b. His \u201cprotection\u201d towards Brown \u2013 begging for supplies, loyalty \u2013 far outstrips any protective gesture toward Sis. He never tries to shield her from paddles; he only learns \u201cwhat the native Venusians hate so much\u201d as Brown requires.  \n\nB. \u201cSis Appreciates\u201d Lacks Evidence  \n  a. Sis never shows gratitude for Ferdinand\u2019s \u201cconsideration.\u201d She repeatedly lectures, scolds and tries to indoctrinate him. Only at the end, out of strategic self-interest, does she agree to \u201chelp\u201d Brown. That is not genuine appreciation but political maneuvering (\u201c<invalid_quote>An honor, Miss Sparling\u2026please come in. There\u2019s a hurry-up draft</invalid_quote>\u201d).  \n  b. Sister\u2019s goal is to marry \u201csome fancy dryhorn\u201d \u2013 she sees marriage as political advancement, not sibling\u2019s welfare. She uses Ferdinand as \u201cdependent male member\u201d in passport clause.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n- Ferdinand\u2019s covert disobedience, emotional reliance on Butler, self-identification as immature \u201ctadpole,\u201d lack of protective gestures toward Sis, and eventual drive to wed Brown for paternal guidance demonstrate that his deepest psychological need is for a father figure to help him \u201cgrow into a man,\u201d not to protect his sister.  \n- Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprotective sibling\u201d thesis cannot account for his reckless lawbreaking, submissive curiosity about warcraft and repeated plea to Sis to accept Brown. Therefore our position is correct.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe feels protective of her and she appreciates his consideration\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Ferdinand\u2019s obedience and concern a) \u201cI torn down the corridor\u2026 I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\u201d <quote> I turned around obediently.</quote> (p. 3). He delays his exploration to avoid alarming her, showing deference and concern. b) He insists on concealment of Mr. Brown to protect her sister\u2019s future: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn him in if I took her to him.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get Mr. \u2026 into trouble\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 31). He risks detection himself rather than endanger Sis\u2019s plans.\n\n2. Ferdinand\u2019s protective warnings a) He warns Sis that venturing alone among \u201cnaked\u201d lifeboats is dangerous, yet obeys her commands, demonstrating his sense of guardianship: <invalid_quote>\u201cthe law\u2026 the worst a boy can get into.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 2). He perceives harm and legal jeopardy for both of them. b) He professes shared guilt: \u201cAfter a moment\u2026 I nodded. \u2018You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve also become a male outside the law. We\u2019re in this together.\u2019\u201d <quote> We're in this together.</quote> (p. 15). His willingness to share culpability underscores protective solidarity.\n\n3. Sister\u2019s appreciation and reliance a) Sis relies on Ferdinand\u2019s corrections: At the dunging-drug geography question, only Ferdinand catches her purser\u2019s error, earning her respect. <quote> Please make the correction in your notes.\"</quote> she admits. (p. 22). She values his input, a mark of sibling trust. b) She stages a \u201cconfession\u201d in order to visit Brown under Ferdinand\u2019s direction: She \u201cstaggered back\u201d yet agrees to his plan, demonstrating faith in his judgments. Finally, she consents to the marriage he orchestrates: <invalid_quote>\u201cAn honor, Miss Sparling\u2026 Please come right in.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 32). She recognizes his \u201churry-up draft\u201d as a solution.\n\n4. Emotional closeness and mutual dependence a) Ferdinand adopts the diminutive \u201cFord\u201d to create a shared identity, \u201cFordie,\u201d echoing familial nicknames. <invalid_quote>\u201cFerdinand your label? \u2026 I\u2019ll call you Ford.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 20). A sign of sibling intimacy. b) His devastation when coerced by Sis to reveal his stowaway: he sweats and \u201ccouldn\u2019t fool Sis \u2026 she just knew me too well\u201d (p. 27). Only someone protective and close elicits that depth of emotional conflict.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cYearns for a Father Figure\u201d Position\n\n1. No mention of paternal yearning a) Ferdinand explicitly lacks a father but never expresses desire to replace his father by calling Sis\u2019s suitors \u201cpop.\u201d Instead, he defers to Brown\u2019s masculine authority: \u201cHave you killed \u2026 Mr. Butt?\u201d he admires his actions. <quote> I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster </quote> (p. 8). He\u2019s drawn to masculine role models, but he warns him against using his own power until maturity, reflecting a protective, juvenile role rather than a needy child role. b) Ferdinand wields authority over Sis\u2019s plans: he forces her to discuss political philosophy, instructs her to meet Brown only on his terms, and demands she honor his promises. A child yearning for a father would not assert such control over an adult sister.\n\n2. Sister remains \u201cboss\u201d a) Sis constantly lectures and orders Ferdinand, demonstrating she is his guardian, not vice versa. <quote>\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\"</quote> she warns. (p. 2). If he yearned for a father figure, his obedience is purely sibling deference, not filial. b) Her promise to \u201cnot turn in\u201d Brown is given out of deference to Ferdinand\u2019s gamble, not because she thinks him a son figure. She pursues her political and marital ambitions even after meeting Brown under Ford\u2019s direction, showing her independence persists. Ferdinand does not fulfill the decisively guiding role of a parent.\n\n3. Final marriage plan b) Ferdinand\u2019s plan culminates in provoking a marriage between his sister and Brown: \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (p. 33). A protective brother channels Brown\u2019s threat into a safe solution for his sister\u2019s future. A child wanting a father would not engineer his own displacement from sister\u2019s affections; Ferdinand\u2019s role is to safeguard her prospects, not supplant Brown.\n\nConclusion  \nFerdinand\u2019s consistent deference to Sis\u2019s authority, coupled with his willingness to share guilt, warn her from danger, and ultimately engineer a lawful future for her, demonstrates protective fraternal relation appreciated and relied upon by Sis. There is no textual evidence of Ferdinand\u2019s yearning to supplant paternal roles; rather, he safeguards his sister\u2019s well-being, confirming our position.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of Our Claim  \nWe maintain that Ferdinand \u201cfeels close to [Sis] as a sibling, but yearns for a father figure.\u201d His primary motive throughout is to find male authority and masculine guidance\u2014he idolizes and depends on Butt Lee Brown\u2014while chafing under his sister\u2019s \u201cbossy\u201d tutelage.  \n\n2. Reinforcement of Our Position  \nA. Ferdinand\u2019s Secret Lawbreaking vs. Sis\u2019s Authority  \n  a. \u201c<quote>I broke the law.</quote>\u201d (p. 10) Despite Sis\u2019s repeated warnings \u201c<invalid_quote>be careful\u2026Remember you\u2019re a nice boy.</invalid_quote>\u201d (p. 2), Ferdinand defies her to explore alone and find a male guide. If his loyalty were purely to her wellbeing, he would not risk both their lives in contraband lifeboat ventures. His lone initiative shows a search for something Sis cannot supply.  \n  b. Emotional and Practical Dependence on Brown  \n    \u2022 \u201c<quote>I learned so many wonderful things about Venus every time I visited that stowaway.</quote>\u201d (p. 28) Ferdinand begs Brown for fruit, geography lessons, spacesuit drills, and mechanical lore. He never gains similar instruction from Sis.  \n    \u2022 He accepts Brown\u2019s insistence that he is \u201c<quote>plain too young</quote>\u201d to handle a blaster \u201cuntil\u2026come of age\u201d (p. 19). This paternal restriction echoes father\u2013son dynamics.  \n\nB. Self-Identification as Immature \u201cTadpole\u201d and Desire to \u201cGrow into a Man\u201d  \n  a. Ferdinand repeatedly uses \u201ctadpole\u201d imagery: \u201c<invalid_quote>Only a tadpole\u2026I\u2019m a growing tadpole</invalid_quote>\u201d (pp. 8, 19). He lacks a male mentor until he meets Brown.  \n  b. Sis\u2019s own excuse for bringing him: \u201c<quote> so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.</quote>\u201d (p. 7). His voyage is a tutelage by women until he finds the one male presence he craves.  \n\nC. Ultimate Goal: Securing Brown as Head of New Family  \n  a. Ferdinand urges Sis to accept Brown: \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (p. 33). He does not propose himself as husband but as subordinate in a new family hierarchy, indicating his desire for paternal protection and guidance.  \n  b. He orchestrates Sis\u2019s dangerous meeting with Brown, risking her \u201cprofessional career\u201d (p. 32) to secure a male head for \u201cbuilding Venus.\u201d This selfless\u2014and reckless\u2014act is motivated by a child\u2019s belief that only a man can safeguard and teach them on a frontier world.  \n\n3. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cProtective Sibling\u201d Thesis  \nA. Obedience Does Not Equal Protection  \n  a. \u201c<quote>I turned around obediently.</quote>\u201d (p. 6) only delays his defiance; he immediately resumes his solo exploration, prioritizing male experience over Sis\u2019s caution. He does not return to cabin until he secures Brown\u2019s alliance.  \n  b. His self-confession to Sis \u201c<quote>We're in this together</quote>\u201d (p. 15) is a ploy to gain permission to continue his patronage of Brown. He never abandons risk until he finds a male mentor.  \n\nB. Lack of Genuine Gratitude from Sis  \n  a. Sis \u201clectures\u201d him continually (e.g., p. 27), never thanking him for \u201cwarnings\u201d or \u201csharing guilt.\u201d Her final acquiescence to Brown is driven by her own \u201cgovernment career\u201d and \u201churry-up draft,\u201d not Ferdinand\u2019s pysche.  \n  b. She labels him \u201cFerdinand,\u201d then \u201cFord,\u201d only after Brown\u2019s approval (p. 20). Changing his name is Brown\u2019s act, not Sis\u2019s paternal renaming; Ferdinand seeks identity from a man.  \n\nC. No Attempt to Supplant Brown  \n  a. A protective brother would forbid Sis to risk \u201cForcible Citizenship Indoctrination\u201d (p. 13), yet he encourages her to meet Brown despite the danger. Protective sibling behavior would avoid, not court, risk.  \n  b. He never positions himself as substitute husband/father; he remains deferential, awaiting Brown\u2019s paternal role.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nFerdinand\u2019s persistent lawbreaking against his sister\u2019s orders, his craving for instruction and approval from Butt Lee Brown, repeated self-identification as an immature \u201ctadpole,\u201d and his orchestration of a marriage between Sis and Brown all point to a child\u2019s search for a father figure. Our position best explains his behavior; Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprotective sibling\u201d reading cannot account for his reckless preference for male tutelage over Sis\u2019s safe, lawful guidance.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe Feels Protective of Her and She Appreciates His Consideration\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Ferdinand\u2019s Deference and Shared Risk  \n  a. Obedience to Avoid Danger: \u201cTwenty minutes after\u2026 I wriggled out\u2026 I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\u201d <quote>I turned around obediently.</quote> (p. 3). He may long to explore, but he delays to spare Sis anxiety about his safety. A dependent \u201ctadpole\u201d would sneak entirely alone, not wait and share the risk.  \n  b. Shared Liability: Upon being caught by law, Ferdinand immediately aligns himself with Sis: <quote> We're in this together.\"</quote> (p. 15). By accepting guilt equally, he seeks to protect her reputation and safe passage, not to provoke law enforcement for personal maturity.\n\n2. Eliciting and Heeding Sister\u2019s Political Authority  \n  a. Ferd\u2019s Parliamentary Corrections: During the geography lecture, only Ferdinand\u2019s prompt correction of the purser earns Sis\u2019s admiration: <quote> Please make the correction in your notes.\"</quote> (p. 22). She integrates his input, showing she values and relies on his protective vigilance over bad information that could harm her \u201cActive interest\u201d and quotas.  \n  b. Sis\u2019s Directives and Ferdinand\u2019s Compliance: Almost every narrative turn, Sis lectures Ferdinand (\u201c<quote>Now you be careful,</quote>,\u201d p. 2; formal \u201cFerdinand\u201d summons, p. 27), and he obeys. A \u201cson\u201d seeking maturity would flout her authority in favor of male guidance; instead, he defers to her \u201cpolicy\u201d while covertly protecting her interests.\n\n3. Protection through Marriage Strategy  \n  a. Engineering a Safe Husband and Legal Cover: Ferdinand persuades Sis to accept Brown only after ensuring Brown can pay fines and supply food, and only after Sis\u2019s promise \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t turn him in\u201d (p. 31). He transforms Brown\u2019s threat into her political advantage on Venus\u2014ensuring Sis\u2019s compliance with husband quotas and enabling Ferdinand\u2019s own legal status via \u201cdependent male\u201d provision.  \n  b. Sis\u2019s Acceptance as Gratitude: Although startled (\u201cshe actually staggered back,\u201d p. 32), Sis consents to Brown\u2019s \u201churry-up draft\u201d only after Ferdinand\u2019s intercession, showing faith in his judgment for her welfare: <invalid_quote>\u201cAn honor, Miss Sparling\u2026 Please come right in.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 32).\n\n4. Ferdinand\u2019s Role as Younger Brother, Not Father-Seeker  \n  a. Limited Personal Agency: Ferdinand repeatedly begs Brown for instruction and treats Brown\u2019s stories as adventure vicariously: <invalid_quote>\u201cI learned so many wonderful things\u2026 I could name every part [of the blaster] \u2026 But no matter what, he would never let me hold it.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 21). His fascination is juvenile; his mature concern is always Sis\u2019s well-being, not his own.  \n  b. Absence of Resentment: A child yearning for fatherly approval would resent Sis\u2019s \u201cbossy\u201d political stance. Instead, Ferdinand protects her political ambitions (quota, passport clause) and shares her obedience to law when it serves her. His sole rebellion is only to facilitate safe exploration and ultimate resettlement on Venus under Sis\u2019s detected \u201cdependent\u201d status.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFather Figure\u201d Thesis\n\n1. Reckless Disobedience Is Tactical, Not Craving Paternal Rebellion  \n  a. A son would not \u201cmake faces\u201d at Sis then obey her admonitions (p. 3) or share legal risk (p. 15). Ferdinand exploits stowaway only to improve Sis\u2019s prospects, not to vanish under male guidance.  \n  b. His entreaty to Sis to \u201csay yes!\u201d to Brown is for her benefit and for his own legal cover; he never requests to accompany Brown alone or expresses wish to leave Sis.\n\n2. Sis Retains Authority, Undermining \u201cFather-Seeking\u201d Role  \n  a. \u201cFemale attorneys\u201d and \u201cForcible Citizenship Indoctrination\u201d discussions (p. 9) show she successfully wields political power over Brown and Ferdinand. She controls family fate; Ferdinand\u2019s compliance underscores fraternal dynamic.  \n  b. Her \u201cfinal gesture\u201d in booking him into lifeboat only after Ferdinand\u2019s promise demonstrates respect for his protective judgment, not his personal ambition to supplant her.\n\n3. Mutual Dependence, Not One-Sided Neediness  \n  a. Sis depends on Ferdinand\u2019s corrections to avoid dangerous misinformation. She alone takes notes; she \u201cdoesn\u2019t take\u201d incorrect details (p. 22). A protective brother role is vital.  \n  b. Ferdinand\u2019s joy in helping Brown with food smuggling is driven by reciprocity: Brown plans to help him, too, on Venus (\u201cmy pockets were folded from fines\u2026 I stowed away,\u201d p. 12). Ferdinand protects Sis to maintain Brown\u2019s goodwill for both of them.\n\nConclusion  \nFerdinand\u2019s consistent deference to Sis\u2019s authority, his acceptance of shared peril, his tactical orchestration of a husband to secure her future and his belated integration as \u201cdependent male member\u201d per an agreed clause, plus Sis\u2019s explicit reliance on and acceptance of his counsel, all demonstrate a fraternal protective relationship. There is no evidence he seeks to usurp or permanently defer to Brown at Sister\u2019s expense; rather, he uses Brown\u2019s resources to fulfill his protective duty. Therefore, our position\u2014that Ferdinand is a caring brother whose actions safeguard and are appreciated by his sister\u2014is fully supported by the text.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
