    "background_text": "Mr. Meek Plays Polo By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" ",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy is Gus engaged in space fighting?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Largely to ward off boredom\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy is Gus engaged in space fighting?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Largely to ward off boredom\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Largely to ward off boredom\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Largely to ward off boredom\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy is Gus engaged in space fighting?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Largely to ward off boredom\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cAvenging His Father\u2019s Feud\u201d\n\n1. Explicit Statements of Vengeance\n  a. \u201cI\u2019m fixing to go over into Thirty-seven and yank Bud up by the roots\u201d  \n     \u2013 Gus\u2019s sole stated motive for boarding Bud\u2019s ship is retribution (\u201cyank...up by the roots,\u201d \u201ccrucify him\u201d). <quote>y back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. </quote> (II)  \n  b. Recovery of Injector Insufficient: Gus admits that mere return of the injector does not satisfy him; he still wants \u201ceven.\u201d <quote> Just getting your property back ain't getting even. </quote> (IV)  \n  c. Adoption of Space Polo as \u201cFinal Battle\u201d: The radio describes the polo match as \u201cthe final battle in a feud that has been going on in the Ring for years.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe sporting event</invalid_quote> <quote>will be played here</quote> <quote>The outcome</quote> <invalid_quote>will decide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors.\u201d</invalid_quote> (End)  \n\n2. Feud Is Inherited and Ancient\n  a. \u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing about them bugs that make sense...been fighting...for years.\u201d  \n     \u2013 The feud predates all current participants, inherited across generations. Gus\u2019s reference to \u201cmy father\u2019s fight\u201d is implied by \u201cbeen fighting ... for years.\u201d (I & II)  \n  b. The introduction of \u201ceducated bugs\u201d is part of a longstanding territorial rivalry. Gus accepts them on his rock, yet flees under their onslaught, illustrating stubborn, inherited territorialism rather than mere boredom.  \n\n3. High Stakes and Resource Control\n  a. Radiation Moss Monopoly: Control of sheds on the Ring gives exclusive rights to grow \u201cradiation moss,\u201d vital to Earth\u2019s medicine. Victory secures his sector\u2019s supply. <invalid_quote>\u201cHere on the Inner Ring</invalid_quote> <quote>men squatted</quote> <invalid_quote>because Earth needed the moss.\u201d</invalid_quote> (III)  \n  b. Risking unreliable ships and stilts to collect bugs or demand \u201csupremacy\u201d is irrational if \u201cboredom\u201d alone motivated them \u2013 they could remain safely at their own rock and tend moss. The only sensible motive is ultimate control.  \n\n4. Pattern of Proxy Warfare\n  a. Gus accepts space polo only as a \u201crespectable\u201d substitute at the insistence of a \u201cwelfare lady,\u201d but immediately demeans the idea. He has never played and knows his ships are unfit. Yet he consents because it promises final resolution of his feud. <invalid_quote>\u201cShe wants us to play games...Space polo is a game...we\u2019ll leave it up to this man...I saw a game once.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n  b. The voluntariness and fanfare of a public \u201ctournament\u201d underscores that this is warfare by sport to settle disputes once and for all.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cBoredom\u201d Thesis\n\n1. Moe\u2019s \u201cboredom\u201d claim is contradicted by Gus\u2019s own obsession with \u201cgetting even,\u201d not merely \u201csomething to do.\u201d Moe is a secondary witness, himself seeking peace.  \n2. If mere \u201cboredom\u201d drove them, they would equally resume feuding after a polo interlude, yet the radio proclaims \u201cforever supremacy.\u201d Boredom cannot yield \u201cforever.\u201d  \n3. The danger of their \u201crickety\u201d ships and the mortality risk is disproportionate to idle pastime. No sportsman would endanger the moss supply and personal safety merely to \u201cpass time.\u201d Reeason: they need to control resources.  \n\nConclusion\n  The text repeatedly emphasizes Gus\u2019s quest for vengeance and final settlement of a generations-old feud \u2013 not mere idle rivalry or ennui. The adoption of space polo serves as a socially \u201crespectable\u201d proxy for the same goal: supremacy over Sector Thirty-seven. Hence, Gus fights to avenge and settle his inherited feud.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Tolerance of occasional death: \u201cNot many \u2026 get killed \u2026 willing to take a chance.\u201d Pure vengeance would not accept attrition merely for \u201cexcitement.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Cite: \u201cThey\u2019re willing to take a chance \u2026 Not many get killed \u2026\u201d <quote>\"Not being killed, maybe ... although they're willing to take a chance on that.

Reliance on \u201cgame boards\u201d of bugs solving mathematical puzzles suggests intellectual stimulation craving.  \n      \u2022 Meek recognizes bugs \u201csolving mathematical equations\u201d and uses them as further diversion (\u201cdrive me loopy trying to figure out \u2026\u201d Gus\u2019s own frustration is a response to mental stimulation).  \n   d. The transition from lethal feud to organized sport under welfare guidance underscores the feud\u2019s function as \u201cgame\u201d rather than inheritance.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The only coherent motive consistent with (1) ignorance of feud origins, (2) joy in competition despite risk, (3) \u201cboredom\u201d admissions, and (4) craving new sports is that Gus and the ring\u2010rats fight to ward off boredom by providing continuous, thrilling rivalry.

A static \u201cvictory\u201d offers no more sport.  \n   c. Resource Control Contradiction  \n      \u2022 If conquest of moss alone were aim, Gus could blockade or sabotage quietly; instead he welcomes Bud\u2019s cooperation (\u201cwelfare lady\u201d brokered \u201cpolite\u201d game). He only returns to feud if novelty/lack of sport resurfaces.  \n   d. Disproportionate Risk for Simple Retribution?  \n      \u2022 Risking life in rickety ships and stilts for insect collection and polo far exceeds rational revenge strategy when resource maintenance at own rock is adequate. Only \u201cexcitement\u201d justifies such extremes.  \n\n4. Debunking Opponent\u2019s Assertions  \n   a. Moe\u2019s \u201cBoredom\u201d Testimony  \n      \u2022 Opponent dismisses Moe as \u201csecondary\u201d but Moe lived the reality of \u201cring\u2010rats\u201d; Gus himself echoes fear of boredom turning gratitude.  \n   b. \u201cInherited Feud\u201d Lacks Textual Evidence  \n      \u2022 No mention of Gus\u2019s ancestors; only \u201cbeen fighting \u2026 for years,\u201d but no \u201cfather\u2019s feud\u201d language.

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy is Gus engaged in space fighting?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Avenging his father\u2019s feud\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Largely to ward off boredom\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Largely to ward off boredom\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cAvenging Father\u201d Theory Fails  \n   a. No textual support for a familial or ancestral feud motive.  \n      \u2022 The origin of the feud is \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cit has gotten so it really doesn't matter.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cNo one knows what started the feud \u2026 The only thing that matters is \u2026 the final battle \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background V)  \n   b.

Tolerance of occasional death: \u201cNot many \u2026 get killed \u2026 willing to take a chance.\u201d Pure vengeance would not accept attrition merely for \u201cexcitement.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Cite: \u201cThey\u2019re willing to take a chance \u2026 Not many get killed \u2026\u201d <quote>\"Not being killed, maybe ... although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them get killed, in</quote> (Background II)  \n   b. Acceptance of far more dangerous sport\u2014space polo\u2014once introduced, shows craving for novel excitement.  \n      \u2022 He hails space polo\u2014requiring \u201cexpert piloting,\u201d \u201cnoble game\u201d\u2014even though it risks \u201c[rickety] ships\u201d falling apart. <quote>declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert piloting, a fine sense of timing</quote> (Background IV)  \n   c. Reliance on \u201cgame boards\u201d of bugs solving mathematical puzzles suggests intellectual stimulation craving.  \n      \u2022 Meek recognizes bugs \u201csolving mathematical equations\u201d and uses them as further diversion (\u201cdrive me loopy trying to figure out \u2026\u201d Gus\u2019s own frustration is a response to mental stimulation).  \n   d. The transition from lethal feud to organized sport under welfare guidance underscores the feud\u2019s function as \u201cgame\u201d rather than inheritance.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The only coherent motive consistent with (1) ignorance of feud origins, (2) joy in competition despite risk, (3) \u201cboredom\u201d admissions, and (4) craving new sports is that Gus and the ring\u2010rats fight to ward off boredom by providing continuous, thrilling rivalry. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfather\u2019s feud\u201d hypothesis has no textual anchor and cannot explain continuing conflict post-\u201cvengeance\u201d or embrace of exotic sports.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cAvenging His Father\u2019s Feud\u201d\n\n1.

The adoption of space polo serves as a socially \u201crespectable\u201d proxy for the same goal: supremacy over Sector Thirty-seven.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cAvenging Father\u201d Theory Fails  \n   a. No textual support for a familial or ancestral feud motive.  \n      \u2022 The origin of the feud is \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cit has gotten so it really doesn't matter.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cNo one knows what started the feud \u2026 The only thing that matters is \u2026 the final battle \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background V)  \n   b. Gus recovers his own stolen injector and still wants to continue fighting, even though his \u201crights\u201d restoration should satisfy a purely \u201cavenging\u201d motive.  \n      \u2022 He admits \u201cJust getting your property back ain\u2019t getting even.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t orthodox \u2026 I never did have a chance to smack Bud \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background IV)  \n   c. Gus subscribes only to sports sections \u201cnuts about sports \u2026 always wanted to see a game,\u201d indicating personal desire for thrill, not family vengeance.  \n      \u2022 Cite: \u201cSubscribes \u2026 only reads the sports section.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cSubscribes to a daily paper \u2026 All he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background II)  \n\n3. The Boredom\u2010Relief Motive Explains All Key Facts  \n   a. Tolerance of occasional death: \u201cNot many \u2026 get killed \u2026 willing to take a chance.\u201d Pure vengeance would not accept attrition merely for \u201cexcitement.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Cite: \u201cThey\u2019re willing to take a chance \u2026 Not many get killed \u2026\u201d <quote>\"Not being killed, maybe ... although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them get killed, in</quote> (Background II)  \n   b. Acceptance of far more dangerous sport\u2014space polo\u2014once introduced, shows craving for novel excitement.  \n      \u2022 He hails space polo\u2014requiring \u201cexpert piloting,\u201d \u201cnoble game\u201d\u2014even though it risks \u201c[rickety] ships\u201d falling apart. <quote>declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert piloting, a fine sense of timing</quote> (Background IV)  \n   c. Reliance on \u201cgame boards\u201d of bugs solving mathematical puzzles suggests intellectual stimulation craving.  \n      \u2022 Meek recognizes bugs \u201csolving mathematical equations\u201d and uses them as further diversion (\u201cdrive me loopy trying to figure out \u2026\u201d Gus\u2019s own frustration is a response to mental stimulation).  \n   d. The transition from lethal feud to organized sport under welfare guidance underscores the feud\u2019s function as \u201cgame\u201d rather than inheritance.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The only coherent motive consistent with (1) ignorance of feud origins, (2) joy in competition despite risk, (3) \u201cboredom\u201d admissions, and (4) craving new sports is that Gus and the ring\u2010rats fight to ward off boredom by providing continuous, thrilling rivalry. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfather\u2019s feud\u201d hypothesis has no textual anchor and cannot explain continuing conflict post-\u201cvengeance\u201d or embrace of exotic sports.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restoring and Securing His Inherited Rights, Not Mere Pastime  \n   a. \u201cFinal Battle in a Feud\u201d Language  \n      \u2022 <quote>of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two</quote> (End)  \n      \u2013 \u201cForever\u201d implies permanent resolution, not a temporary thrill to stave off boredom. Boredom\u2010driven fighters would resume hostilities; they do not seek \u201cforever\u201d peace by winning once.  \n   b. Vengeful Intent Expressed in Plain Terms  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m fixing to go over into Thirty-seven and yank Bud up by the roots\u2026 I never did have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked him.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n      \u2013 Gus explicitly refers to \u201cgetting even,\u201d \u201ccrucify him,\u201d \u201cgetting satisfaction,\u201d active pursuit of retribution beyond mere competition.  \n   c. Refusal to Abandon Territory  \n      \u2022 Gus \u201clived\u201d on his rock, \u201cdrove me out of house and home\u201d by bugs, yet rescues bugs, endures stilts to reclaim them. (III\u2013IV)  \n      \u2013 If competition alone mattered, he\u2019d avoid needless risk of stilts and return to his rock. Instead, he insists on full territorial reclamation, a hallmark of vengeance.  \n\n2. Extreme Risk and Resource Stakes Contradict \u201cBoredom\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Fragile Ships and Stilts Too Hazardous for \u201cFun\u201d  \n      \u2022 Moe: ships \u201cwould split wide open,\u201d stilts are clumsy \u201cI never had been any great shakes on stilts\u201d (III).  \n      \u2013 Boredom\u2010seeking amateurs avoid life\u2010threatening exploits; Gus embraces them to settle the feud once and for all.  \n   b. Vital Radiation Moss Monopoly  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHere on the Inner Ring\u2026because Earth needed the moss.\u201d</invalid_quote> (III)  \n      \u2013 Control of moss is Earth\u2019s sole source, a valuable commodity. A \u201cboredom\u201d motive would risk supply; a vengeance motive compels recapture of all territory before peaceful cultivation.  \n\n3. Longstanding, Inherited Feud, Not Spontaneous Despair  \n   a. \u201cBeen Fighting\u2026for Years\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote> They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"</quote> (II)  \n      \u2013 Ancestral, intractable rivalry defines their identity and claims, not ephemeral boredom.  \n   b. Unknown Origin Irrelevant to Continuity  \n      \u2013 Debater_B cites \u201cunknown origin,\u201d but in every cultural conflict from human history, wars often outlast memory of the spark. Continuity of vengeance is well\u2010documented even when origins are forgotten.  \n\n4. \u201cSpace Polo\u201d as a Sanctioned Finale of the Feud  \n   a. Welfare \u201cGames\u201d Imposed by Outsider  \n      \u2022 Gus only adopts polo under government pressure from Miss Perkins and Moe, and is initially skeptical. (II)  \n      \u2013 He accepts only as a \u201crespectable\u201d channel to achieve his retributive aims under public scrutiny (\u201ctournament,\u201d radio hype). Boredom\u2010seekers would invent games themselves, not await a daily newspaper\u2019s sports section.  \n   b. Publicity and Announcement Emphasize Feud Outcome  \n      \u2022 Radio: <invalid_quote>\u201cfinal battle in a feud\u2026decide, forever, the supremacy\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (End)  \n      \u2013 The sport\u2019s sole function is to subsume the feud in a controlled scenario, then cement victory.  \n\n5. Refutation of \u201cBoredom\u201d Arguments  \n   a. \u201cDie of Boredom\u201d vs. Willingness to Risk Death  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cNot many get killed\u2026although they\u2019re willing to take a chance.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n      \u2013 If thrill alone mattered, they\u2019d avoid the risk\u2010heavy bug retrieval and stilting. Their \u201cchance\u201d is a byproduct of war, not entertainment.  \n   b. Gus\u2019s \u201cAwful\u201d to Become \u201cPolite\u201d Reflects Fear of Defeat  \n      \u2022 <quote>we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being polite to one another.\" \"That would be awful,\"</quote> (IV)  \n      \u2013 \u201cPolite\u201d equals submission to the other sector; Gus dreads this loss of honor and control. Boredomists wouldn\u2019t lament courtesy; they would welcome new diversion.  \n   c. Gus\u2019s Sole Focus on \u201cGetting Even\u201d vs. \u201cNuts About Sports\u201d  \n      \u2013 While Gus reads sports accounts, he has never seen a game and still fights the feud by hijacking his own tool (bugs) and staging an improvised match. His \u201csports\u201d obsession is a vehicle for warfare, not end in itself.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery substantive text cue\u2014explicit vengeance language, perpetual stakes over moss, ancestral \u201cyears\u2010long\u201d fighting, acceptance of extreme risk, and the framing of polo as the \u201cfinal battle\u201d\u2014points decisively to Gus\u2019s motive being vengeance for and the permanent resolution of a deep\u2010seated feud inherited from his forebears. The \u201cboredom relief\u201d theory cannot account for his unyielding pursuit of \u201cgetting even,\u201d his fear of \u201cpolite\u201d defeat, nor his willingness to endure life\u2010threatening trials to reclaim territory.  \n\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that Gus and the ring\u2010rats engage in space fighting \u201cbecause they\u2019d plain die of boredom\u201d without continual rivalry and novel challenges.  \n   Cite: \u201cIf them boys \u2026 didn\u2019t have their feud they'd plain die of boredom.\u201d <quote>If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom.</quote> (Background II)  \n\n2. Direct Textual Support for Boredom\u2010Relief Motive  \n   a. Gus\u2019s Own Fear of \u201cPoliteness\u201d  \n      \u2022 He dreads an end to rivalry as \u201cawful.\u201d He admits a polite peace \u201cain\u2019t going to be the same again.\u201d <quote>This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.</quote> (Background IV)  \n   b. Insistence on \u201cRespectable Games\u201d as Diversion  \n      \u2022 Gus is \u201cnuts about sports\u201d yet never saw one; he craves the excitement. <invalid_quote>Subscribes to a daily paper \u2026 All he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.</invalid_quote> (Background II)  \n      \u2022 Space polo\u2014risking rickety ships\u2014only makes sense as thrilling diversion, not resource\u2010safe strategy. <quote>declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert piloting, a fine sense of timing</quote> (Background IV)  \n   c. Intellectual Stimulation from \u201cEducated Bugs\u201d  \n      \u2022 Gus \u201calmost drove him loopy trying to figure out what kind of game they were playing.\u201d <quote>First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.</quote> (Background II)  \n      \u2022 Meek discovers the bugs solve mathematical problems, not turf wars: pure mental challenge. (Background III)  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cAvenging Father\u201d Theory  \n   a. No Familial or Territorial Origin Established  \n      \u2022 \u201cNo one knows what started the feud \u2026 it has gotten so it really doesn't matter.\u201d <invalid_quote>No one knows what started the feud \u2026 The only thing that matters is that \u2026 the final battle \u2026</invalid_quote> (Background V)  \n      \u2022 If vengeance were principal, recovery of stolen injector should end hostilities; yet Gus \u201cnever did have a chance to smack Bud\u201d and explicitly \u201cJust getting your property back ain\u2019t getting even.\u201d <quote>Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud i</quote> (Background IV)  \n   b. \u201cSupremacy Forever\u201d Means Perpetual Entertainment  \n      \u2022 The radio\u2019s \u201cwill decide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors\u201d is promotion of a final \u201cgame\u201d that, once settled, ends boredom\u2014\u201cforever\u201d implies long\u2010term peace only after exhausting novelty. <quote>game will decide, forever, the supremacy of</quote> (Background V)  \n      \u2022 Yet Moe fears \u201cpoliteness\u201d after the match\u2014affirming that \u201csupremacy\u201d is valued only as a new state of play, not ancestral pride. A static \u201cvictory\u201d offers no more sport.  \n   c. Resource Control Contradiction  \n      \u2022 If conquest of moss alone were aim, Gus could blockade or sabotage quietly; instead he welcomes Bud\u2019s cooperation (\u201cwelfare lady\u201d brokered \u201cpolite\u201d game). He only returns to feud if novelty/lack of sport resurfaces.  \n   d. Disproportionate Risk for Simple Retribution?  \n      \u2022 Risking life in rickety ships and stilts for insect collection and polo far exceeds rational revenge strategy when resource maintenance at own rock is adequate. Only \u201cexcitement\u201d justifies such extremes.  \n\n4. Debunking Opponent\u2019s Assertions  \n   a. Moe\u2019s \u201cBoredom\u201d Testimony  \n      \u2022 Opponent dismisses Moe as \u201csecondary\u201d but Moe lived the reality of \u201cring\u2010rats\u201d; Gus himself echoes fear of boredom turning gratitude.  \n   b. \u201cInherited Feud\u201d Lacks Textual Evidence  \n      \u2022 No mention of Gus\u2019s ancestors; only \u201cbeen fighting \u2026 for years,\u201d but no \u201cfather\u2019s feud\u201d language. Gus admits ignorance of origin.  \n   c. \u201cFinal Settlement\u201d Paradox  \n      \u2022 If feud is ended \u201cforever,\u201d boredom resumes; but Gus\u2019s quoted dread of \u201cpoliteness\u201d shows he fears post\u2010feud doldrums, not anticipating contentment.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The persistent emphasis on \u201cdying of boredom,\u201d Gus\u2019s thirst for mental puzzles and sports, his fear of peaceful \u201cpoliteness,\u201d and continued fighting even after \u201cgetting even\u201d irrefutably point to a motive of seeking constant stimulation. Debater_A\u2019s vengeance theory neither explains the origin ignorance nor the embrace of new sports at lethal cost. The only coherent motive is relief of ennui through perpetual rivalry.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
