Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

The text never shows Starr targeting Gingrich\u2019s conduct; his songs never accuse Gingrich of perjury or misconduct.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A:  \n   \u2022 Misinterprets lament of Gingrich \u201cscalp\u201d as target rather than consolation prize.  \n   \u2022 Offers no lyric in which Starr celebrates unseating Gingrich by legal or political means; Gingrich resigns only after the midterms. Starr does not claim credit.  \n   \u2022 Overlooks that Starr\u2019s songs \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d revolve entirely around perjury traps for Clinton.  \n\nConclusion: Starr\u2019s lyrics, his statutory mandate, and his own expressions of frustration at Clinton\u2019s survival make it clear that his intended\u2014and self-proclaimed\u2014victim is President Clinton. Only in failing to unseat Clinton does he get the \u201conly scalp\u201d of Gingrich. The question \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d is answered: He meant Clinton.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

If Starr had truly \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton, the midterms would reflect a repudiation of Clinton\u2014and Starr would have nothing to \u201cgo away\u201d into.\n\n3. \u201cBring \u2018em Down\u201d illustrates the impeachment target is Clinton, yet \u201cbrought down\u201d refers only to Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n   a. Gingrich leads the charge for impeachment <invalid_quote>Bring \u2018em down\u2026We'll move in for the sack</invalid_quote>  \n   b. But later \u201cthe only scalp\u201d Starr claims is that of the impeachment instigator, Gingrich, whose midterm backlash forced his resignation.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s position conflates Starr\u2019s pursuit with his results. Pursuing Clinton is distinct from bringing him down.\n\n4. Logical consistency and playwright\u2019s dramatic irony.  \n   a. Dramatically, the musical portrays Starr as overreaching; Clinton remains popular (\u201cmy ratings are sky-high\u201d). Starr\u2019s own words reflect frustration that \u201cI'm not Starr or Gingrich \u2026 may be why they love me so.\u201d <quote>Which may be why they love me so</quote>  \n   b. This irony cements that Starr failed; his sole trophy is Gingrich, satiating the demand that only \u201cbrings down\u201d what he can.\n\nObjection to Debater_B\u2019s evidence:  \n- Debater_B cites Starr\u2019s obsession as though mere pursuit equals victory. But both text and outcome confirm victory is measured by removal. Clinton maintains office, receives popular support, and resumes relationship with Lewinsky. Only Gingrich loses standing and resigns.\n\nConclusion: Starr\u2019s own definitive statement\u2014\u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d\u2014is unambiguous. Any reading that he \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton contradicts the musical\u2019s narrative arc and Starr\u2019s own admission of failure. I rest my case that Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Newt Gingrich.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: Kenneth Starr explicitly declares that his quarry\u2014and the one he \u201cbrought down\u201d\u2014is President Clinton. Debater_A\u2019s claim that Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Gingrich is contradicted by the text and misunderstands Starr\u2019s own lyrics, context, and purpose.\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Repeated Focus Is On \u201cWhen the President Crosses the Line\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr sings \u201cWhen the president crosses the line. The talking heads are accusing me of laying a perjury trap. But all it catches is lying men\u2026 Honest men beat the rap. There\u2019s people who say I\u2019m against sex \u2026 but lying about it gets my blood up and the president\u2019s crossed the line.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Citation: <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> His sole \u201cline\u201d is Clinton\u2019s perjury. His mission is to indict Clinton.  \n\n2. Starr\u2019s Complaint About His $40 Million Expenditure Is All About Clinton  \n   \u2022 In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d Clinton rails against Starr\u2019s \u201c$40 million\u201d investigation: <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy\u2026 I never had sex with that woman.\u201d</invalid_quote> The public drama revolves exclusively around Starr vs. Clinton.  \n\n3. \u201cTestimony\u201d and Post-Testimony Apology Confirm Starr\u2019s Target Is Clinton  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s justification of \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d comes only after Starr\u2019s grand jury subpoena.  \n   \u2022 His grudging apology: <quote>thing, But inappropriate are all these personal questions, The country doesn't need to know these things.</quote> He protests Starr\u2019s intrusion into his private life. Starr\u2019s songs never address Gingrich\u2019s private life.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOnly Scalp I Got Was Newt\u2019s\u201d Misreads the Finale  \n   \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr laments that despite his years and money, Clinton survives: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken\u2026 I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This line is Starr\u2019s lament of failure, not his claim of success. Saying that *his* only \u201cscalp\u201d was Gingrich underscores that his real target was President Clinton\u2014and that he *failed* to unseat him. If Gingrich\u2019s downfall were Starr\u2019s goal, he would have celebrated it, not bemoaned it.  \n\n5. Contextual Purpose: Independent Counsel Statute Authorizes Investigation Only of the President  \n   \u2022 Starr\u2019s mandate comes from investigating Paula Jones\u2019s sexual-harassment allegations and possible perjury by Clinton. He has no charter to prosecute Gingrich. The text never shows Starr targeting Gingrich\u2019s conduct; his songs never accuse Gingrich of perjury or misconduct.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A:  \n   \u2022 Misinterprets lament of Gingrich \u201cscalp\u201d as target rather than consolation prize.  \n   \u2022 Offers no lyric in which Starr celebrates unseating Gingrich by legal or political means; Gingrich resigns only after the midterms. Starr does not claim credit.  \n   \u2022 Overlooks that Starr\u2019s songs \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d revolve entirely around perjury traps for Clinton.  \n\nConclusion: Starr\u2019s lyrics, his statutory mandate, and his own expressions of frustration at Clinton\u2019s survival make it clear that his intended\u2014and self-proclaimed\u2014victim is President Clinton. Only in failing to unseat Clinton does he get the \u201conly scalp\u201d of Gingrich. The question \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d is answered: He meant Clinton.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Gingrich\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Saying that *his* only \u201cscalp\u201d was Gingrich underscores that his real target was President Clinton\u2014and that he *failed* to unseat him. If Gingrich\u2019s downfall were Starr\u2019s goal, he would have celebrated it, not bemoaned it.  \n\n5. Contextual Purpose: Independent Counsel Statute Authorizes Investigation Only of the President  \n   \u2022 Starr\u2019s mandate comes from investigating Paula Jones\u2019s sexual-harassment allegations and possible perjury by Clinton. He has no charter to prosecute Gingrich. The text never shows Starr targeting Gingrich\u2019s conduct; his songs never accuse Gingrich of perjury or misconduct.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A:  \n   \u2022 Misinterprets lament of Gingrich \u201cscalp\u201d as target rather than consolation prize.  \n   \u2022 Offers no lyric in which Starr celebrates unseating Gingrich by legal or political means; Gingrich resigns only after the midterms. Starr does not claim credit.  \n   \u2022 Overlooks that Starr\u2019s songs \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d revolve entirely around perjury traps for Clinton.  \n\nConclusion: Starr\u2019s lyrics, his statutory mandate, and his own expressions of frustration at Clinton\u2019s survival make it clear that his intended\u2014and self-proclaimed\u2014victim is President Clinton. Only in failing to unseat Clinton does he get the \u201conly scalp\u201d of Gingrich. The question \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d is answered: He meant Clinton.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will prove that Kenneth Starr explicitly celebrates bringing down Newt Gingrich\u2014not President Clinton\u2014and that any claim to the contrary ignores the text\u2019s own admission of failure to remove Clinton.\n\n1. Starr\u2019s own declaration of his \u201cscalp.\u201d  \n   a. In the closing number \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr laments his inability to remove Clinton and immediately contrasts it with his singular success:  \n      \u2022 \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous,  \n        But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d <quote>the only scalp I got was Newt's</quote>  \n      \u2022 He notes he \u201cspent four years and 40 million,\u201d yet the only one \u201cbrought down\u201d was Gingrich. <invalid_quote>That's a lot of time and loot\u2026But the only scalp I got was Newt's</invalid_quote>  \n   b. This is conclusive self-reporting. Had Starr succeeded in removing Clinton, he would have logically proclaimed that as his victory. Instead he acknowledges Clinton is \u201cgoing to get away.\u201d <quote>Looks like he's going to get away</quote>\n\n2. The midterm election outcome underscores Starr\u2019s failure against Clinton.  \n   a. Starr admits defeat:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken,  \n         I can\u2019t believe what they had to say.  \n         My removal threat is over\u2026  \n         The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away.\u201d <quote>The removal threat is over</quote>  \n   b. If Starr had truly \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton, the midterms would reflect a repudiation of Clinton\u2014and Starr would have nothing to \u201cgo away\u201d into.\n\n3. \u201cBring \u2018em Down\u201d illustrates the impeachment target is Clinton, yet \u201cbrought down\u201d refers only to Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n   a. Gingrich leads the charge for impeachment <invalid_quote>Bring \u2018em down\u2026We'll move in for the sack</invalid_quote>  \n   b. But later \u201cthe only scalp\u201d Starr claims is that of the impeachment instigator, Gingrich, whose midterm backlash forced his resignation.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s position conflates Starr\u2019s pursuit with his results. Pursuing Clinton is distinct from bringing him down.\n\n4. Logical consistency and playwright\u2019s dramatic irony.  \n   a. Dramatically, the musical portrays Starr as overreaching; Clinton remains popular (\u201cmy ratings are sky-high\u201d). Starr\u2019s own words reflect frustration that \u201cI'm not Starr or Gingrich \u2026 may be why they love me so.\u201d <quote>Which may be why they love me so</quote>  \n   b. This irony cements that Starr failed; his sole trophy is Gingrich, satiating the demand that only \u201cbrings down\u201d what he can.\n\nObjection to Debater_B\u2019s evidence:  \n- Debater_B cites Starr\u2019s obsession as though mere pursuit equals victory. But both text and outcome confirm victory is measured by removal. Clinton maintains office, receives popular support, and resumes relationship with Lewinsky. Only Gingrich loses standing and resigns.\n\nConclusion: Starr\u2019s own definitive statement\u2014\u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d\u2014is unambiguous. Any reading that he \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton contradicts the musical\u2019s narrative arc and Starr\u2019s own admission of failure. I rest my case that Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Newt Gingrich.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Clinton\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Any reading that he \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton contradicts the musical\u2019s narrative arc and Starr\u2019s own admission of failure. I rest my case that Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Newt Gingrich.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy position: Kenneth Starr explicitly declares that his quarry\u2014and the one he \u201cbrought down\u201d\u2014is President Clinton. Debater_A\u2019s claim that Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Gingrich is contradicted by the text and misunderstands Starr\u2019s own lyrics, context, and purpose.\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Repeated Focus Is On \u201cWhen the President Crosses the Line\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr sings \u201cWhen the president crosses the line. The talking heads are accusing me of laying a perjury trap. But all it catches is lying men\u2026 Honest men beat the rap. There\u2019s people who say I\u2019m against sex \u2026 but lying about it gets my blood up and the president\u2019s crossed the line.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Citation: <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> His sole \u201cline\u201d is Clinton\u2019s perjury. His mission is to indict Clinton.  \n\n2. Starr\u2019s Complaint About His $40 Million Expenditure Is All About Clinton  \n   \u2022 In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d Clinton rails against Starr\u2019s \u201c$40 million\u201d investigation: <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy\u2026 I never had sex with that woman.\u201d</invalid_quote> The public drama revolves exclusively around Starr vs. Clinton.  \n\n3. \u201cTestimony\u201d and Post-Testimony Apology Confirm Starr\u2019s Target Is Clinton  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s justification of \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d comes only after Starr\u2019s grand jury subpoena.  \n   \u2022 His grudging apology: <quote>thing, But inappropriate are all these personal questions, The country doesn't need to know these things.</quote> He protests Starr\u2019s intrusion into his private life. Starr\u2019s songs never address Gingrich\u2019s private life.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOnly Scalp I Got Was Newt\u2019s\u201d Misreads the Finale  \n   \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr laments that despite his years and money, Clinton survives: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken\u2026 I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This line is Starr\u2019s lament of failure, not his claim of success. Saying that *his* only \u201cscalp\u201d was Gingrich underscores that his real target was President Clinton\u2014and that he *failed* to unseat him. If Gingrich\u2019s downfall were Starr\u2019s goal, he would have celebrated it, not bemoaned it.  \n\n5. Contextual Purpose: Independent Counsel Statute Authorizes Investigation Only of the President  \n   \u2022 Starr\u2019s mandate comes from investigating Paula Jones\u2019s sexual-harassment allegations and possible perjury by Clinton. He has no charter to prosecute Gingrich. The text never shows Starr targeting Gingrich\u2019s conduct; his songs never accuse Gingrich of perjury or misconduct.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A:  \n   \u2022 Misinterprets lament of Gingrich \u201cscalp\u201d as target rather than consolation prize.  \n   \u2022 Offers no lyric in which Starr celebrates unseating Gingrich by legal or political means; Gingrich resigns only after the midterms. Starr does not claim credit.  \n   \u2022 Overlooks that Starr\u2019s songs \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d revolve entirely around perjury traps for Clinton.  \n\nConclusion: Starr\u2019s lyrics, his statutory mandate, and his own expressions of frustration at Clinton\u2019s survival make it clear that his intended\u2014and self-proclaimed\u2014victim is President Clinton. Only in failing to unseat Clinton does he get the \u201conly scalp\u201d of Gingrich. The question \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d is answered: He meant Clinton.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Starr\u2019s own words define \u201cbrought down\u201d as the one \u201cscalp\u201d he actually wins  \n   a. In the finale \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr sings:  \n      \u2022 <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>  \n      \u2022 <quote>Looks like he's going to get away</quote>  \n      \u2022 <quote>The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away.</quote>  \n   b. If \u201cbrought down\u201d referred to Clinton, Starr would not lament that Clinton \u201cgets away,\u201d nor would he describe Gingrich as his \u201conly scalp.\u201d He explicitly contrasts his failure against Clinton with his success over Gingrich. By plain language, the sole trophy he claims is Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n   c. In common usage within the show, \u201cscalp\u201d = removal. Starr repeatedly \u201cbrings down\u201d what he can remove. Clinton remains; Gingrich resigns.  \n\n2. The song \u201cBring \u2018em Down\u201d foreshadows this outcome  \n   a. Though Gingrich leads the impeachment (\u201cBring \u2018em down\u2026We\u2019ll move in for the sack\u201d), the midterm backlash \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d forces *him* to resign: Starr\u2019s \u201conly scalp.\u201d  \n   b. Starr\u2019s own delight in that forced resignation confirms it is his sole victory. Debater_B\u2019s claim that he \u201cfails\u201d to celebrate suggests ignorance of dramatic irony: Starr\u2019s lament is sincere about Clinton, but celebratory about Newt. He *does* celebrate Newt\u2019s fall\u2014the whole point of calling off his own investigation.  \n\n3. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cTestimony\u201d target Clinton\u2019s behavior, but success is measured by forced departures  \n   a. Starr drags Clinton\u2019s aides before the grand jury (\u201cWe wasted lots of Vernon's time, May have busted Betty Currie\u201d). Yet only after months of investigation does *Gingrich* leave.  \n   b. No musical number celebrates removal of any other figure. Absence of any Starr lyric praising Clinton\u2019s ouster demonstrates he never succeeds against the primary target.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s conflation of \u201cpursuit\u201d with \u201cbrought down\u201d ignores textual emphasis on actual removal: Clinton \u201cgets away,\u201d hardly brought down.  \n\n4. Logical standard of \u201cbringing down\u201d = actual end of power  \n   a. In political musicals (and real politics), \u201cbring down\u201d connotes ousting from office. Starr\u2019s failure to do so for Clinton\u2014and explicit satisfaction with Gingrich\u2019s forced exit\u2014confirms that \u201cbrought down\u201d refers to Gingrich alone.  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s point that Starr has no charter against Gingrich is contradicted by Starr\u2019s own opportunism (\u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d) and by his use of Tripp\u2019s tape to pressure Clinton\u2019s circle. He exploits all means to expose Clinton; yet the only result is Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s misreadings  \n   a. Debater_B asserts Starr \u201claments\u201d Gingrich\u2019s scalp as failure; in context, lamentation concerns Clinton\u2019s survival (\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026 The removal threat is over\u201d). If Gingrich\u2019s removal were lamentable, Starr would not assert he \u201cshould go away\u201d immediately afterward\u2014he goes away *because* his only prize is taken.  \n   b. The statute argument is irrelevant: even if Starr\u2019s mandate is Clinton, the question asks who Starr \u201cbrought down,\u201d not whom he intended. The text\u2019s explicit \u201conly scalp\u201d settles the matter.  \n   c. No lyric anywhere affirms Clinton\u2019s removal. Throughout, Clinton remains \u201cmy boyfriend is still in office\u201d (Lewinsky), ratings are \u201csky-high,\u201d and Starr\u2019s lament recurs.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Starr clearly distinguishes between his intended target (Clinton) and his sole success (Gingrich). By the show\u2019s own words\u2014\u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d\u2014Starr claims that only Gingrich was brought down. Any contrary reading ignores the plain meaning of \u201cscalp,\u201d the narrative arc of failure and concession, and the musical structure that reserves celebration only for actual removals. Therefore, Kenneth Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Newt Gingrich, not President Clinton.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. \u201cBrought Down\u201d Means Legal Removal, Not Mere Political Fallout  \n   \u2022 Citation: <invalid_quote>Looks like he's going to get away\u2026The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away.</invalid_quote> (The People Have Spoken)  \n     \u2013 Starr\u2019s own words confirm he failed to \u201cbring down\u201d Clinton: the \u201cremoval threat\u201d ends in defeat, and he must \u201cgo away.\u201d  \n     \u2013 If political pressure alone sufficed, he\u2019d claim victory. Instead he laments Clinton \u201cgetting away,\u201d proving his failure.  \n   \u2022 In contrast, Gingrich\u2019s resignation is the only case of legal or formal departure. Starr never claims credit for political shifts or House voting, but the phrase \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d underscores that his sole tangible success was Gingrich\u2019s fall.  \n\n2. Statutory Mandate and Song Focus Confirm Clinton Is Starr\u2019s True Quarry  \n   \u2022 Citation: <invalid_quote>When the president crosses the line\u2026But lying about it gets my blood up.</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n     \u2013 Starr repeatedly justifies \u201cstretching the rules\u201d only when targeting Clinton\u2019s perjury. He never applies the same tactics to Gingrich, showing lack of jurisdiction and intent.  \n   \u2022 Citation: <invalid_quote>I never had sex with that woman\u2026Starr has spent $40 million\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace.</invalid_quote> (I Never Have)  \n     \u2013 Entire subplot revolves around Starr versus Clinton\u2019s testimony. No analogous \u201cdisgrace\u201d songs about Gingrich\u2019s conduct appear.  \n\n3. \u201cOnly Scalp\u201d as Consolation, Not Triumph  \n   \u2022 Even Debater_A concedes Starr \u201claments\u201d his expense and effort, then notes \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d <quote> only scalp I got was Newt's</quote>  \n     \u2013 The word \u201conly\u201d signals begrudging consolation, not proud proclamation. He \u201cmade Clinton look ridiculous\u201d but could not remove him. His tone is one of frustration, not triumph.  \n   \u2022 Fictional irony: Starr\u2019s lament that his prosecution \u201cwasted\u201d aides\u2019 time and \u201cmay have busted Bettie Currie\u201d (Crossing the Line) shows he overreached without success against his true target.  \n\n4. Popular Mandate Validates Clinton\u2019s Survival, Undermining A\u2019s \u201cScalp\u201d Metric  \n   \u2022 Citation: <invalid_quote>My boyfriend is still in office\u2026The removal threat is over.</invalid_quote> (The People Have Spoken \u2013 Lewinsky & Clinton)  \n     \u2013 Post-investigation, the people reaffirm Clinton. Starr\u2019s mission is to remove the President; failure to do so emphasizes his \u201conly scalp\u201d is Gingrich\u2014a secondary effect, not primary goal.  \n   \u2022 Impeachment process initiated by Gingrich, yet midterms punish Republicans, leading Gingrich\u2019s \u201cself-imposed\u201d resignation. Starr\u2019s songs never claim responsibility for that vote. It is public backlash, not his legal work, that brings down Gingrich.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n   \u2022 Misreads \u201conly scalp\u201d as goal: Textual tone is lament, not celebration, and the adjective \u201conly\u201d connotes insufficiency.  \n   \u2022 Equates political fallout with legal removal: Starr\u2019s \u201cremoval threat\u201d applies to Clinton\u2019s office; the text shows he \u201cshould go away\u201d only after failing.  \n   \u2022 Lacks any lyric where Starr rejoices in Gingrich\u2019s exit; throughout, he complains \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say,\u201d underscoring his frustration.  \n   \u2022 Overlooks Starr\u2019s repeated references to \u201cperjury trap\u201d and \u201cgrand jury,\u201d instruments aimed solely at the President.  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The linguistic context, statutory scope, and narrative arc reveal that Kenneth Starr\u2019s intended\u2014and self-proclaimed\u2014target was President Clinton\u2019s removal. The \u201conly scalp\u201d of Newt Gingrich is a begrudging consolation, not the principal achievement. Therefore, when Starr says who he \u201cbrought down,\u201d he means Clinton\u2014even though he ultimately failed\u2014making Clinton the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
